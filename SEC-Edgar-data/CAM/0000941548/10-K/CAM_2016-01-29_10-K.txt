3 Table of Contents ITEM 1.
BUSINESS Cameron International Corporation (Cameron or the Company) provides flow equipment products, systems and services to worldwide oil and gas industries through four business segments  Subsea, Surface, Drilling and Valves & Measurement (V&M). For additional business segment information for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which Notes are included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In 1920, Jim Abercrombie, Ed Lorehn, Harry Cameron and several other partners incorporated an oilfield repair shop in Houston, Texas under the name Cameron Iron Works (CIW). Abercrombie subsequently invented and CIW manufactured the industrys first blowout preventer for use in oil and gas well drilling. CIW grew rapidly due to sales of blowout preventers and other oilfield equipment. In the early 1940s, CIW entered the market for defense-related equipment becoming a major supplier of anti-submarine and other naval armaments to the U.S. Navy. CIW also became a leading supplier of forged metal products for both defense and oilfield applications replacing less durable cast metal components of the day. CIW subsequently expanded into various other flow control, valve and pressure control equipment businesses acquiring Joy Petroleum Equipment and McEvoy-Willis wellhead equipment prior to its acquisition by Cooper Industries, Inc. in 1989.
Cameron was incorporated in its current form as a Delaware corporation on November 10, 1994, when Cooper Industries transferred all of the assets and liabilities of its Petroleum and Industrial Equipment segment into this new entity. Following this, the Company operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cooper Industries from 1994 until June 30, 1995, when it was spun-off as a separate stand-alone company and renamed Cooper Cameron Corporation. The Company subsequently changed its name to Cameron International Corporation in May 2006. Since becoming a stand-alone company, Cameron has made numerous acquisitions, including the 1996 acquisition of Ingram Cactus Company, the 1998 acquisition of Orbit Valve International, Inc., 2004s acquisition of Petreco International, Inc., the purchase of substantially all of the businesses within the Flow Control segment of Dresser, Inc. in 2005, the acquisition of NATCO Group Inc. ( NATCO ) in 2009, the purchase of LeTourneau Technologies Drilling Systems, Inc. in 2011 and the acquisition of the TTS Energy Division from TTS Group, ASA in 2012. In 2013, Cameron and Schlumberger Limited joined together to form OneSubsea  , a venture established to manufacture and develop products, systems and services for the subsea oil and gas market. Cameron is a 60% owner and manager of OneSubsea. Cameron has also sold various operations during the time it has been a stand-alone company, including its Reciprocating Compression business in June 2014 and its Centrifugal Compression business, which closed effective January 1, 2015. Today, Cameron is a Fortune 500 company with annual revenues of more than $10 billion and a workforce of over 28,000 employees. Cameron also has legal entities in more than 50 countries worldwide.
The common stock of Cameron trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CAM. The Companys Internet address is www.c-a-m.com . General information about Cameron, including its Corporate Governance Principles, charters for the committees of the Companys board of directors, Code of Conduct, and Codes of Ethics for Management Personnel, including Senior Financial Officers, and Directors, can be found in the Governance and Compliance sections of the Companys website. The Company makes available on its website its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files or furnishes them to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).

4 Table of Contents Markets and Products Subsea Segment The Subsea segment delivers integrated solutions, products, systems and services to the subsea oil and gas market, including integrated subsea production systems involving wellheads, subsea trees, manifolds and flowline connectors, subsea processing systems for the enhanced recovery of hydrocarbons, control systems, connectors and services designed to maximize reservoir recovery and extend the life of each field. The Subsea segment includes the operations of OneSubsea, a business jointly owned by Cameron (60%) and Schlumberger (40%). Products and services are marketed products under the Cameron  , Mars  , McEvoy  and Willis  brand names through a worldwide network of sales and marketing employees, supported by agents in some international locations. The Companys custom process systems products are marketed under the Cameron  , Consept  , Cynara  , Hydromation  , KCC  , Metrol  , Mozley  , NATCO  , Petreco  , Porta-test  , Unicel  , Vortoil  and Wemco  brand names. Due to the technical nature of many of the products offered and the complexity of the subsea field layouts and designs, the marketing effort is further supported by a staff of engineering employees.
On January 6, 2015, the Company announced the execution of definitive agreements between OneSubsea, Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc. and Schlumberger for a non-incorporated alliance formed to develop technologies and to deliver equipment and services designed to provide customers with more cost effective and more efficient subsea well intervention solutions, particularly for deep and ultra-deepwater basins and high well pressure environments.
Surface Segment Camerons Surface segment designs and manufactures complete wellhead and Christmas tree systems for onshore and offshore topside applications  from conventional to high-pressure, high temperature systems, to specialized systems for dry completions and heavy oil. The Surface segment, with its extensive global installed base of equipment, is the industrys largest provider of surface completion and production equipment and has a large services footprint in each of its served markets. A complete portfolio of API 6A valves, chokes, actuators and artificial lift technologies is marketed primarily to oil and gas operators under the Cameron  , Camrod  , IC  , McEvoy  , Precision  , SBS  , Tundra  , Willis  and WKM  brand names.
One of the major services provided by the Surface segment is CAMSHALE Production Solutions, which specializes in shale gas production. In this process, intense pressure from fracing fluid (usually a mixture of water and sand) is used to crack surrounding shale. Once the fractures are made, the water is removed from the well bore and the sand is left behind to hold the fractures open. Oil and natural gas then moves out of the fractures, into the well bore, and up to the surface.
New technology developments and increased market penetration, along with robust customer spending in recent years for exploration and production, particularly within unconventional resource regions of North America, has resulted in increased demand for the Companys equipment and services. As a result, the Surface segment achieved growth in both orders and revenues during each of the last three years covered by this Annual Report.
Drilling Segment The Drilling segment of Cameron is one of the leading global suppliers of integrated drilling systems for onshore and offshore applications to shipyards, drilling contractors, exploration and production companies and rental tool companies. Drilling equipment designed and manufactured includes ram and annular BOPs, control systems, drilling risers, drilling valves, choke and kill manifolds, diverter systems, topdrives, drawworks, mud pumps, pipe handling equipment, other rig products and parts and services. The products are marketed by a staff of sales and marketing employees supported by an engineering group under the Cameron  , Guiberson  , H&H CUSTOM  , H&H Melco  , LeTourneau  , Lewco  , OEM  , Sense  and Townsend  brand names.
The Drilling segment significantly enhanced its product offerings to its customers with the late 2011 acquisition of LeTourneau Technologies Drilling Systems, Inc. (LeTourneau) from Joy Global Inc., and the mid-2012 acquisition of TTS Energy Division from TTS Group ASA, a Norwegian company (TTS). LeTourneau provides drilling equipment and rig designs and components for both the land and offshore rig markets. LeTourneaus products include elevating systems, skidding systems, cranes, topdrives, rotary tables, drawworks, mud pumps and rig control and power systems. TTS provides high performance drilling equipment, rig packages and rig solutions for both onshore and offshore rigs internationally.
5 Table of Contents Camerons Drilling segment continues to be a primary supplier of BOPs and related equipment to the drilling industry. The level of major project awards for new drilling equipment is often influenced by construction cycles for new build deepwater drillships and semi-submersibles, as well as shallow water jack-up rigs. In recent years, the level of such awards was strong during the 2006  2008 and 2011  2012 time periods but has tapered off in 2013 and 2014 as the supply of rigs is currently exceeding demand.
Tighter regulations for the industry and an increased focus on safety have caused drilling contractors and operators, both on land and in deepwater environments, to turn to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for service, equipment repair and related parts, in many cases to re-certify BOP stacks back to OEM specifications or for new equipment to replace an aging fleet. This has led to increased demand for the Companys services and for additional drilling stacks, BOPs and related equipment for use as spares to supplement or replace existing equipment currently in use. The Company has continued to experience strong demand for parts and services in 2014 and 2013 despite the drop off in major new project awards.
Valves & Measurement Segment The V&M segment includes businesses that provide valves and measurement systems primarily used to control, direct and measure the flow of oil and gas as they are moved from individual wellheads through flow lines, gathering lines and transmission systems to refineries, petrochemical plants and industrial centers for processing. Equipment used in these environments is generally required to meet demanding standards set by the American Petroleum Institute and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.
Products include gate valves, ball valves, butterfly valves, Orbit  brand rising stem ball valves, double block & bleed valves, plug valves, globe valves, check valves, actuators, chokes and parts and services, as well as measurement products such as totalizers, turbine meters, flow computers, chart recorders, ultrasonic flow meters and sampling systems.
This equipment and the related services are marketed through a worldwide network of combined sales and marketing employees, as well as distributors and agents in selected international locations. Due to the technical nature of many of the products, the marketing effort is further supported by a staff of engineering employees. Customers include oil and gas majors, independent producers, engineering and construction companies, pipeline operators, drilling contractors and major chemical, petrochemical and refining companies.
The product lines included in this segment are as follows: Distributed Valves Distributed valves are used in the exploration, production and transportation of oil and gas, with products historically sold through a network of wholesalers and oilfield supply distributors, primarily in North America and to upstream markets in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. In order to expand the Companys downstream industrial valve offerings, Douglas Chero, a forged gate, globe and check valve manufacturer located in Italy, was acquired during 2013.
Although demand for distributed valves was strong during much of 2014, order rates decreased in the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to the third quarter of 2014 reflecting the weakening in commodity prices and activity levels during the latter half of the year.
Distributed valves are marketed under the brand names AOP  , Demco  , Douglas Chero  , Dynatorque  , Maxtorque  , Navco  , Newco  , Nutron  , OIC  , Techno  , Texstream  , Thornhill Craver  , Wheatley  and WKM  .
Engineered Valves Engineered valves include a full range of highly customized ball, gate and check valves serving the oil and gas production, pipeline, subsea and liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets. Products are marketed under the brand names Cameron  , Entech  , Grove  , Ledeen  , Ring-O  , TK  , Tom Wheatley  and WKM  . Demand for engineered valves has historically been affected by the scope and timing of large development and infrastructure projects involving long lead times.
6 Table of Contents Process Valves Process valves are sold under the brand names of General Valve  , Orbit  and TBV  for use in critical service applications that are often subject to extreme temperature conditions, particularly in refinery, power generation (including nuclear), chemical, petrochemical, gas processing and liquid storage terminal markets, including LNG.
Measurement Systems The V&M segment also designs, manufactures and distributes measurement products, systems and solutions to the global oil and gas, process and power industries. Brand names for these products include Barton  , Caldon  , Clif Mock  , Jiskoot  , Linco  and Nuflo  .
Services In addition to the above, V&M provides preventative maintenance, OEM spare parts, repair, field service, asset management and remanufactured products for valves and actuators through service centers situated in strategic locations around the world.
Market Issues The success of hydraulic fracturing activities in recent years has led to increased supplies of oil and natural gas in North America. This, combined with various other factors such as, (i) continued strong production levels from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and certain other resource-rich countries, (ii) current weakness in world demand for petroleum due to slowing economic growth in certain regions, and (iii) the strong U.S. dollar, in which a significant portion of world trade in petroleum products occurs, has contributed to a decline in commodity prices which began during the latter half of 2014, and has continued into early 2015. While market activity was generally strong for the first nine months of 2014, activity levels began to weaken toward the end of the year as a result of the decline in commodity prices. We believe these declines in commodity prices will reduce market activity levels in 2015, which will lower the demand for our products and services. Although the Company has a substantial backlog of work that is scheduled to be executed during 2015, weaker demand for our products and services is expected to have an adverse impact on new orders, revenues and earnings. Based on the Companys long history in the energy sector, we believe such declines in commodity prices and demand are cyclical in nature. During such cyclical downturns, we take steps to adjust our commercial, manufacturing and support operations as appropriate to ensure that the Company remains competitive and financially sound. The Company cannot predict the timing of improvement in market conditions.
Cameron continues to be one of the leaders in the global market for the supply of petroleum production equipment. Cameron believes that it is well-positioned to serve these markets, even during downturns. Plant and service center facilities around the world in major oil and gas producing regions provide broad market coverage. Information relating to revenues generated from shipments to various geographic regions of the world is set forth on page 2 of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Cameron International Corporation included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference.
The market beyond North America continues to be important to Cameron, accounting for nearly 64% of Camerons revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014, up from 61% in 2013 and 55% in 2012. The desire to expand oil and gas resources and transmission capacity in developed and developing countries, for both economic and political reasons, continues to be a major factor affecting market demand. Production and service facilities in North and South America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East and West Africa provide the Company with the ability to serve the global marketplace.
As a result of tighter regulations for the industry in recent years and an increased focus on safety, the Company has experienced increased demand in its Drilling segment to service and, in many cases, re-certify existing BOP stacks back to original OEM specifications. The Company believes this trend by operators to use OEMs to service their equipment will continue in the near future.
Also, based upon the Companys broad portfolio of products, Cameron has a significant presence in the offshore oil and gas drilling, production and infrastructure market. The Company provides drilling equipment packages for drilling rigs, drilling and production risers, subsea production systems, oil and gas separation equipment, chokes, valves and other equipment to the offshore market. Approximately 62% of the Companys 2014 revenue was derived from the offshore market (51% in 2013).
7 Table of Contents Cameron is also a significant participant, through its OneSubsea venture with Schlumberger, in serving the subsea systems projects market. This market is significantly different from the Companys other markets since subsea systems projects are significantly larger in scope and complexity, in terms of both technical and logistical requirements. Subsea projects (i) typically involve long lead times, (ii) typically are larger in financial scope, (iii) typically require substantial engineering resources to meet the technical requirements of the project and (iv) often involve the application of existing technology to new environments and in some cases, new technology. The Companys OneSubsea business has a backlog of approximately $2.7 billion for subsea systems projects at December 31, 2014. To the extent the Company experiences unplanned difficulties in meeting the technical and/or delivery requirements of the projects, the Companys earnings or liquidity could be negatively impacted. For additional information, see the Companys Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Cameron International Corporation included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference.
The creation of OneSubsea in 2013 allows the Company to bring together Schlumbergers expertise in subsea processing and platform integration with Camerons capabilities in subsea equipment to provide customers with the ability to greatly increase their subsea reservoir recovery rates.
Also, see Part I, Item 1A for a discussion of other risk factors, some of which are market related, that could affect the Companys financial condition and future results.
New Product Development For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, research and product development expenditures, including amounts incurred on projects designed to enhance or add to its existing product offerings, totaled approximately $128 million, $83 million and $63 million, respectively. The Subsea segment accounted for 58%, 44% and 47% of each respective years total costs.
On January 6, 2015, the Company announced the execution of definitive agreements between OneSubsea, Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc. and Schlumberger for a non-incorporated alliance formed to develop technologies and to deliver equipment and services designed to provide customers with more cost effective and more efficient subsea well intervention solutions, particularly for deep and ultra-deepwater basins and high well pressure environments.
Working with numerous universities around the world through the Companys Sustainability Business Model, the Company was able to commercialize the EVERMAX lubricant in 2013. Formulated as a grease, EVERMAX features nanotechnology additives which reduce friction by orders of magnitude over traditional lubricants. The Company expects this product to provide significant improvements in operating efficiency and wear reduction in Camerons ball valve products as well as BOPs and gate valve applications.
Cameron has also provided funding for university research in both the United States and Brazil for the development of advanced materials that dampen vibration that could be caused by ocean currents in subsea environments. Cameron's researchers have also worked with a variety of technical partners around the world in developing elastomer seals that perform better in low temperature, high pressure environments.
OneSubsea continues to focus on new technology development in areas such as Life of Field services, Processing, Controls, Optimization and High Pressure and High Temperature applications and in the integration of subsea and subsurface technologies to increase recovery and lower intervention costs. As example, in 2014 OneSubsea delivered a subsea multiphase meter with an innovative conductivity probe that allows for the determination of water in gas or oil down to the parts-per-million (PPM) level or to detect changes in water salinity. Additionally, three innovative subsea sampling solutions were delivered to clients in various parts of the world. Similarly, testing was completed on a 3.8Mw high-pressure subsea multiphase boosting pump to the satisfaction of, and support from, several Oil and Gas Operators. Finally, as discussed above, OneSubsea entered into an alliance with Schlumberger and Helix Energy Solutions that will deliver to the market efficient and cost-effective light well intervention technologies.
Additionally, Cameron continues to improve its CO2 membrane technology. The Cynara PN-1 membrane product was released in 2012 with enhanced separation characteristics for high volume gas applications. This resulted from a joint development effort between Cameron and Petronas and was recently selected for a large gas processing plant in Southeast Asia.
8 Table of Contents Another new CO2 membrane will be released in 2015 with capabilities to handle higher natural gas pressures and lower CO2 concentrations, which initially will be marketed for on-shore gas processing applications. This technology is an alternative to amine systems in many applications, with significant lower operating cost, modular construction and smaller footprint.
The monoethylene glycol (MEG) reclamation technology is a continued focus for product improvement and enhancement. The latest generation of Camerons brine displacement solution was launched in 2013 as PureMEG. The latest developments include divalent salt removal systems and improved salt management processes. These enhancements are targeted to provide better reliability and OPEX.
In 2014, Cameron began offering the BilectricHF, which combines our established Bilectric desalting product with the performance enhancements achieved by our Dual Frequency power units. This hybrid of two established technologies will provide producers and refiners with options to upgrade existing installations for improved throughput, performance or chemical optimization.
The CDX Compact Deaeration technology will be launched in 2015. This packed bed reactor solution will provide substantial space and weight savings as compared to traditional vacuum deaeration solutions utilized offshore for seawater flooding. This is the result of a 3 year development that is in the final stage of field demonstration testing.
Over the last three years, Camerons Surface segment has developed a number of products to serve the hydraulic fracturing (frac) market. The F-T90 horizontal frac tree is ultra-compact in design to reduce frac stack height. In 2014, Cameron expanded the F-T90 fleet to include 5 15,000-psi trees in both Canada and the U.S. The Monoline Frac Fluid Delivery System (FFDS) eliminates a significant number of frac iron connections, eliminates the need for expensive safety strapping, reduces footprint and reduces wellsite clutter for added safety benefits. Camerons rotating casing hanger facilitates running the casing string in highly deviate wells, reducing both rig time and the risk of stuck pipe. The tension hanger designed by Cameron allows for the tubing string to be pulled straighter on completion to allow for artificial lift solutions that are required later for almost all shale wells. To address the needs of maturing frac wells, Camerons Surface Systems Engineering group has improved the CAMLIFT 30-120, CAMLIFT 30-144 and the CAMLIFT 40-192 systems to extend seal life by reducing the hammering effects in the system. This has improved operators uptime and significantly exceeds the uptime average for artificial lift wells. Throughout the life of the frac wells, the new CAM20-MT Interchanger Multi-Trim choke is a cost-effective solution that allows fast actuated adjustments to keep up with changing well conditions and is designed for fast and easy replacement of internals if they get damaged by sand or proppant.
During 2011, the Companys Drilling segment delivered the industrys first and only 13 25,000-psi BOP stack for use in a high-pressure application in the Gulf of Mexico. Currently, the Company has on order a second 25,000-psi BOP stack and a 25,000-psi manifold which is expected to be delivered in 2015. Previously, in another first, the Drilling segment had introduced an 18 20,000-psi BOP stack in 2009, which had the characteristics of reduced height and weight found in the EVO  BOP that was introduced in 2007 as a compact, lighter version of Camerons traditional subsea BOP. Also during 2008, the Company introduced the Sea Pressure Accumulator  (SPA), a complement to the EVO BOP, which uses seawater pressure instead of traditional nitrogen-charged accumulator bottles to power the BOP rams. In 2012, Cameron developed a derivative system of SPA called Sea Pressure Reduction Assembly (SPRA), which reduces hydrostatic seawater effects on the EVO BOP operating system. This, in turn, makes more efficient use of existing accumulator capacity. Another highlight of 2012 was the development of the stab-in connection system (STiCS). The STiCS provides an automated means of safely and quickly connecting heavy choke and kill hoses to the riser slip joint which saves hours of rig time.
The Drilling segment also introduced a number of products to the industry in 2014 including the CognitionTM Stack Instrumentation Infrastructure package and EVO 300 Bonnet technology that were introduced at the Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) and the X-COM operators chair that was introduced at the Offshore North Seas Conference (ONS). The Cognition package is a network of sensors, data recorders and communications on the subsea stack that provides critical information for real-time subsea stack monitoring, conditioned-based maintenance, and emergency mitigation and recovery. The EVO 300 Bonnet is a simpler bonnet design for the EVO BOP which has an increased closing force of 54% over the previous design. The X-COM operators chair improves upon the earlier chair design and incorporates added features to improve operational efficiency.
In addition, the Mark IV HA control systems and Mark IV control POD were introduced. The Mark IV system  featuring an industry-first three-POD design option  improves operational reliability of the drilling system through redundancy and simplified POD design. Each control POD within the system has also been improved to include 33% more available functions to accommodate eighty-cavity stacks, a 50% reduction in internal tubing to reduce leak paths, and a 26% smaller footprint than its predecessor.
9 Table of Contents Competition Cameron competes in all areas of its operations with a number of other companies, some of which have financial and other resources comparable to or greater than those of Cameron.
Cameron has a leading position in the petroleum production equipment markets. In these markets, Cameron competes principally with Aker Solutions, Balon Corporation, Circor International, Inc., Dover Corporation, Dril-Quip, Inc., Emerson Process Management, FlowServ Corp., FMC Technologies, Inc., GE Oil & Gas Group, Master Flo (a Stream-Flo Industries Ltd. company), National Oilwell Varco Inc., PBV-USA, Inc. (a Zy-Tech Global Industries company), Petrovalve (a Flotek Industries, Inc. company), Pibiviese, Robbins & Myers Fluid Management Group, SPX Corporations Flow Technology Segment, Tyco International Ltd. and the Artificial Lift Systems business of Weatherford, Ltd.
The principal competitive factors in the petroleum production equipment markets are technology, quality, service and price. Cameron believes several factors give it a strong competitive position in these markets. Most significant are Camerons broad product offering, its worldwide presence and reputation, its service and repair capabilities, its expertise in high-pressure technology and its experience in alliance and partnership arrangements with customers and other suppliers.
Manufacturing Cameron has manufacturing facilities worldwide that conduct a broad variety of processes, including machining, fabrication, assembly and testing, using a variety of forged and cast alloyed steels and stainless steel as the primary raw materials. Cameron has, at various times, rationalized plants and products, closed various manufacturing facilities, moved product lines to achieve economies of scale, and upgraded other facilities. The Company has also in recent years constructed new facilities, mainly in certain locations outside of North America, in order to meet expected future demand, particularly with regard to its drilling, surface and subsea product offerings. This is an ongoing process as the Company seeks ways to improve delivery performance and reduce costs. Cameron maintains advanced manufacturing, quality assurance and testing equipment geared to the specific products that it manufactures and uses process automation in its manufacturing operations. Manufacturing facilities typically utilize computer-aided, numeric-controlled tools and manufacturing techniques that concentrate the equipment necessary to produce similar products in one area of the plant in a configuration commonly known as a manufacturing cell. One operator in a manufacturing cell can monitor and operate several machines, as well as assemble and test products made by such machines, thereby improving operating efficiency and product quality.
Camerons test capabilities are critical to its overall processes. The Company has the capability to test most equipment at rated operating conditions, measuring all operating parameters, efficiency and emissions.
All of Camerons Asian, European and Latin American manufacturing plants are ISO certified and API licensed, and most of the U.S. plants are ISO certified. ISO is an internationally recognized verification system for quality management.
Backlog Camerons backlog was approximately $9.5 billion at December 31, 2014 (approximately 60% of which is expected to be shipped during 2015), as compared to $11.1 billion at December 31, 2013, and $8.1 billion at December 31, 2012. Backlog consists of customer orders for which a purchase order or contract has been received, satisfactory credit or financing arrangements exist and delivery is scheduled.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property As part of its ongoing research, development and manufacturing activities, Cameron has a policy of seeking patents when appropriate on inventions involving new products and product improvements. Cameron owns 513 unexpired United States patents and 1,200 unexpired foreign patents. During 2014, 160 new U.S. and 282 new foreign patent applications were filed.
Although, in the aggregate, these patents are of considerable importance to the manufacturing of many of its products, Cameron does not consider any single patent or group of patents to be material to its business as a whole.
Trademarks are also of considerable importance to the marketing of Camerons products. Cameron considers the following trade names to be important to its business as a whole: CAMERON, WILLIS, W-K-M, NATCO and LeTourneau. Other important trademarks used by Cameron are included under Markets and Products above. Cameron has registered trademarks in countries where such registration is deemed important. Cameron has the right to use the trademark Joy on parts until November 2027.
10 Table of Contents Cameron also relies on trade secret protection for its confidential and proprietary information. Cameron routinely enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees, partners and suppliers. There can be no assurance, however, that others will not independently obtain similar information or otherwise gain access to Camerons trade secrets.
Employees As of December 31, 2014, Cameron had approximately 28,000 employees, of which nearly 23% were represented by labor unions.
Over 2,300 employees are covered by union contracts which are slated to expire during 2015, the majority of which are in Italy and Romania.

12 Table of Contents ITEM1A.
RISK FACTORS Factors That May Affect Financial Condition and Future Results Downturns in the oil and gas industry have had, and will likely in the future have, a negative effect on the Companys sales and profitability.
Demand for most of the Companys products and services, and therefore its revenue, depends to a large extent upon the level of capital expenditures related to oil and gas exploration, development, production, processing and transmission. Declines, as well as anticipated declines, in oil and gas prices could negatively affect the level of these activities, or could result in the cancellation, modification or rescheduling of existing orders. For example, oil prices began declining during the third quarter of 2014, dropping nearly 50% from mid-year levels to approximately $53 per barrel as of December 31, 2014. Prices have continued to decline into the mid-$40 range since year end. Similarly, natural gas prices declined late in 2014 from the low-to-mid $4 range per MMBtu to just under $3 per MMBtu at December 31, 2014. These declines have already begun to, and are expected to continue to, affect exploration and production activity levels and, therefore, demand for the Companys products and services at least through 2015. In addition to a decline in future orders and revenues, the Company may also incur additional costs as it seeks to adjust its commercial, manufacturing and support operations levels to meet expected future customer demand. See also the discussion in Market Conditions above for 2014 as compared to 2013.
Cancellation, downsizing or delays of orders in backlog are possible.
As described above, commodity prices have declined significantly since mid-2014 which has resulted in various oil and gas exploration and production companies announcing spending cuts or deferrals in their 2015 capital spending plans, as well as headcount reductions. At current price levels, certain projects, particularly those in deepwater environments and unconventional resource regions, may become uneconomical for the risk involved. Certain customers who are more highly leveraged may also experience concerns regarding future projected cash flows based on current price levels. These factors described above could result in existing orders in backlog being cancelled, downsized or future shipment dates may be delayed, all of which could further negatively impact the Companys future profitability.
At December 31, 2014, the Companys backlog was approximately $9.5 billion, down 14% from December 31, 2013. An example of a cancellation of an existing order is the reversal of $243 million of backlog during the first quarter of 2014 as the result of a customer cancellation of a large drilling project award issued in 2012. Another example of a potential delay or downsizing of a previous awards is the announcement by Chevron in late 2013of the deferral of its Rosebank project, which was awarded in 2013 and currently accounts for $505 million of the Companys ending backlog, in order to work with its partners to improve the projects economics. Although the original contract remains in place, OneSubsea is currently working with Chevron on a revised scope for the project based on a new field layout design.
The inability of the Company to deliver its backlog or future orders on time could affect the Companys sales and profitability and its relationships with its customers.
The ability to meet customer delivery schedules on the Companys existing backlog, as well as future orders, is dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, access to the raw materials required for production, an adequately trained and capable workforce, project engineering expertise for large subsea projects, sufficient manufacturing plant capacity and appropriate planning and scheduling of manufacturing resources. Many of the contracts the Company enters into with its customers require long manufacturing lead times and contain penalty clauses relating to on-time delivery. A failure by the Company to deliver in accordance with customer expectations could subject the Company to financial penalties or loss of financial incentives and may result in damage to existing customer relationships.
Execution of subsea and drilling rig projects exposes the Company to risks not present in its other businesses.
Cameron is involved in development projects involving drilling rigs and, through our subsea business, is a significant participant in the subsea systems projects market. These markets are different from most of the Companys other markets since drilling rig and subsea systems projects are larger in scope and complexity, in terms of both technical and logistical requirements. Both types of projects typically (i) involve long lead times, (ii) are larger in financial scope, (iii) require substantial engineering resources to meet the technical requirements of the project and (iv) often involve the application of existing technology to new environments and, in some cases, may require the development of new technology. The Companys Drilling business had a backlog of approximately $721 million for drilling rig equipment and the subsea business had a backlog of approximately $2.7 billion for subsea systems projects at December 31, 2014. To the extent the Company experiences unplanned difficulties in meeting the technical and/or delivery requirements of the projects, the Companys earnings or liquidity could be negatively impacted. The Company accounts for its drilling and subsea projects, as it does its separation projects, using accounting rules for construction-type and production-type contracts. Factors that may affect future project costs and margins include the ability to properly execute the engineering and design phases consistent with our customers expectations, production efficiencies obtained, and the availability and costs of labor, materials and subcomponents. These factors can impact the accuracy of the Companys estimates and materially impact the Companys future period earnings. If the Company experiences cost overruns, the expected margin could decline. Were this to occur, in accordance with the accounting guidance, the Company would record a cumulative adjustment to reduce the margin previously recorded on the related project in the period a change in estimate is determined. Drilling rig equipment and subsea systems projects accounted for approximately 9% and 14%, respectively, of total 2014 revenues.
13 Table of Contents As a designer, manufacturer, installer and servicer of oil and gas pressure control equipment, the Company may be subject to liability, personal injury, property damage and environmental contamination should such equipment fail to perform to specifications.
Cameron provides products and systems to customers involved in oil and gas exploration, development and production, as well as in certain other industrial markets. Some of the Companys equipment is designed to operate in high-temperature and/or high-pressure environments on land, on offshore platforms and on the seabed, and some equipment is designed for use in hydraulic fracturing operations. Cameron also provides parts and repair services at numerous facilities located around the world, as well as at customer sites for this and other equipment. Because of applications to which the Companys products and services are put, particularly those involving the high temperature and/or pressure environments, a failure of such equipment, or a failure of our customer to maintain or operate the equipment properly, could cause damage to the equipment, damage to the property of customers and others, personal injury and environmental contamination, onshore or offshore, leading to claims against Cameron.
Certain of the Companys risk mitigation strategies may not be fully effective.
The Company relies on customer indemnifications and third-party insurance as part of its risk mitigation strategy. There is, however, an increasing reluctance of customers to provide what had been typical oilfield indemnifications for pollution, consequential losses, property damage, and personal injury and death, and a reluctance, evenrefusal of counterparties to honor their contractual indemnity obligations when given. In addition, insurance companies may refuse to honor their policies.
An example ofboth is the Companys experience in the Deepwater Horizon matter. The Companys customer denied that it owed any indemnification under the contract with us, and when called on to participate in the Companys settlement with BP Exploration and Production Inc., one of the seven insurers refused to provide coverage. The Company subsequently suedits insurerand won a judgment for the full policy amount plus interest and costs, but the insurer continues to litigate the matter and has appealed the judgment.
The implementation of an upgraded business information system may disrupt the Companys operations or its system of internal controls.
The Company has a project underway to upgrade its SAP business information systems worldwide. The first stage of this multi-year effort was completed at the beginning of the third quarter of 2011 with the deployment of the upgraded system to the Companys process systems and compression businesses. Since then, other businesses and business functions have been migrated in stages. As of December 31, 2014, nearly all businesses within the V&M segment, the Surface segment, the Companys worldwide engineering and human resource functions, as well as other corporate office activities are now operating in the upgraded system. The Drilling segment is scheduled to be migrated in 2015 and the OneSubsea business in 2016. The Drilling segment and the OneSubsea business are major contributors to the Companys consolidated revenues and income before income taxes.
As this system continues to be deployed throughout the Company, delays or difficulties may be encountered in effectively and efficiently processing transactions and conducting business operations, including project management, until such time as personnel are familiar with all appropriate aspects and capabilities of the upgraded systems.
A deterioration in future expected profitability or cash flows could result in an impairment of the Companys goodwill.
Total goodwill was nearly $2.5 billion at December 31, 2014.
Due to the significant drop in commodity prices during the latter half of 2014 and the reorganization of the Companys reporting structure, the Company made an additional evaluation of goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2014 based upon macro factors that existed at that point in time. The fair value of our Process Systems reporting unit was estimated to be 10% to 15% higher than its carrying value as part of that evaluation. The estimated fair value for Process Systems was based on forecasted timing and success in receiving new major project awards in 2015 and beyond, the pricing and profitability of those new awards and further improvements in revenue growth and profitability rates from those achieved historically. Should our expectations prove to be incorrect due to (i) further declines in oil and gas prices and continued instability in the worldwide energy markets, (ii) unanticipated delays occurring in project awards, including unplanned project cancellations, or, (iii) an increase in interest rates, our prior estimates of future earnings, cash flows and fair value of the Process Systems business would be negatively impacted, which could lead to an impairment of goodwill for that reporting unit, possibly even as early as our annual evaluation during the first quarter of 2015. Goodwill associated with the Process Systems reporting unit at December 31, 2014 was approximately $571 million.
14 Table of Contents The Companys operations and information systems are subject to cybersecurity risks.
Cameron continues to increase its dependence on digital technologies to conduct its operations. Many of the Companys files are digitized and more employees are working in almost paperless environments. Additionally, the hardware, network and software environments to operate SAP, the Companys main enterprise-wide operating system, have been outsourced to third parties. Other key software products used by the Company to conduct its operations either reside on servers in remote locations or are operated by the software vendors or other third parties for the Companys use as Cloud-based or Web-based applications. The Company has also outsourced certain information technology development, maintenance and support functions. As a result, the Company is exposed to potentially severe cyber incidents at both its internal locations and outside vendor locations that could result in a theft of intellectual property and/or disruption of its operations for an extended period of time resulting in the loss of critical data and in higher costs to correct and remedy the effects of such incidents, although no such material incidents have occurred to date to the Companys knowledge.
Fluctuations in currency markets can impact the Companys profitability.
The Company has established multiple Centers of Excellence facilities for manufacturing such products as subsea trees, subsea chokes, subsea production controls and blowout preventers. These production facilities are located in the United Kingdom, Brazil, Romania, Italy, Norway and other European and Asian countries. To the extent the Company sells these products in U.S. dollars, the Companys profitability is eroded when the U.S. dollar weakens against the British pound, the euro, the Brazilian real and certain Asian currencies, including the Singapore dollar. Alternatively, profitability is enhanced when the U.S. dollar strengthens against these same currencies. For further information on the use of derivatives to mitigate certain currency exposures, see Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk below and Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.
The Companys operations expose it to risks of non-compliance with numerous countries import and export laws and regulations, and with various nations trade regulations including U.S. sanctions.
The Companys operations expose it to trade and import and export regulations in multiple jurisdictions. In addition to using Centers of Excellence for manufacturing products to be delivered around the world, the Company imports raw materials, semi-finished goods and finished products into many countries for use in country or for manufacturing and/or finishing for re-export and import into another country for use or further integration into equipment or systems. Most movement of raw materials, semi-finished or finished products by the Company involves exports and imports. As a result, compliance with multiple trade sanctions and embargoes and import and export laws and regulations poses a constant challenge and risk to the Company. The Company has received a number of inquiries from U.S. governmental agencies, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, regarding compliance with U.S. trade sanction and export control laws, the most recent of which was received in December 2012 and replied to by the Company in January 2013. The Company has undergone and will likely continue to undergo governmental audits to determine compliance with export and customs laws and regulations.
The United States and the European Union (EU) also recently imposed sanctions on various sectors of the Russian economy and on transactions with certain Russian nationals and entities. These sanctions may severely limit the amount of future business the Company does with customers involved in activities in Russia. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 1% of the Companys backlog from continuing operations related to future deliveries to customers doing business in Russia. Customer sales by the Companys continuing operations into Russia during 2014 totaled less than 1% of the Companys sales during the year. In addition, the sanctions of the U.S. and the EU are inconsistent and neither is, as yet, well defined, both of which factors increase the risk of an unintended violation.
15 Table of Contents The Companys operations expose it to political and economic risks and instability due to changes in economic conditions, civil unrest, foreign currency fluctuations, and other risks, such as local content requirements, inherent to international businesses.
The political and economic risks of doing business on a worldwide basis include the following:  volatility in general economic, social and political conditions;  the effects of civil unrest and, in some cases, military action on the Companys business operations, customers and employees, such as that recently occurring in several countries in the Middle East, in Ukraine and in Venezuela;  exchange controls or other similar measures which result in restrictions on repatriation of capital and/or income, such as those involving the currencies of, and the Companys operations in, Angola and Nigeria; and  reductions in the number or capacity of qualified personnel.
In recent months, civil unrest and military action have increased in Iraq which may impact the ability of that country to continue to produce and export oil at current levels. Such unrest may also jeopardize the Companys in-country investments and on-going business activities supporting Iraqs oil and gas production infrastructure. At December 31, 2014, less than 1% of the Companys backlog related to future deliveries to customers doing business in Iraq. Additionally, less than 1% of the Companys property, plant and equipment were located in Iraq. The Company is also evaluating its options under the force majeure clauses of each of the major contracts with its customers doing business in Iraq in the event the current situation in that country continues to deteriorate.
Cameron also has manufacturing and service operations that are essential parts of its business in other developing countries and volatile areas in Africa, Latin America and other countries that were part of the Former Soviet Union, the Middle East, and Central and South East Asia. Recent increases in activity levels in certain of these regions have increased the Companys risk of identifying and hiring sufficient numbers of qualified personnel to meet increased customer demand in selected locations. The Company also purchases a large portion of its raw materials and components from a relatively small number of foreign suppliers in China, India and other developing countries. The ability of these suppliers to meet the Companys demand could be adversely affected by the factors described above.
In addition, customers in countries such as Angola and Nigeria increasingly are requiring the Company to accept payments in the local currencies of these countries. These currencies do not currently trade actively in the worlds foreign exchange markets.
The Company also has certain manufacturing and services operations in Venezuela that contributed $74 million in revenues during 2014. The economy in Venezuela is highly inflationary. As a result, the Companys operations in Venezuela are accounted for as having a U.S. dollar functional currency and the Company considers its earnings in Venezuela to be permanently reinvested. The Company does not currently expect a material gain or loss or a material decline in operating cash flows to occur as a result of any change in the payment practices of its primary customer or in further devaluations of the Venezuelan currency. These factors however, along with recent civil unrest, create political and economic uncertainty with regard to their impact on the Companys continued operations in this country.
Increasingly, some of the Companys customers, particularly the national oil companies, have required a certain percentage, or an increased percentage, of local content in the products they buy directly or indirectly from the Company. This requires the Company to add to or expand manufacturing capabilities in certain countries that are presently without the necessary infrastructure or human resources in place to conduct business in a manner as typically done by Cameron. This increases the risk of untimely deliveries, cost overruns and defective products.
The Companys operations expose it to risks resulting from differing and/or increasing tax rates.
Economic conditions around the world have resulted in decreased tax revenues for many governments, which have led and could continue to lead to changes in tax laws in countries where the Company does business, including further changes in the United States. Changes in tax laws could have a negative impact on the Companys future results.
The Companys operations require it to deal with a variety of cultures, as well as agents and other intermediaries, exposing it to anti-corruption compliance risks.
Doing business on a worldwide basis necessarily involves exposing the Company and its operations to risks inherent in complying with the laws and regulations of a number of different nations. These laws and regulations include various anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.
16 Table of Contents The Company does business and has operations in a number of developing countries that have relatively underdeveloped legal and regulatory systems compared to more developed countries. Several of these countries are generally perceived as presenting a higher than normal risk of corruption, or as having a culture in which requests for improper payments are not discouraged. Maintaining and administering an effective anti-bribery compliance program under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the United Kingdoms Bribery Act of 2010, and similar statutes of other nations, in these environments present greater challenges to the Company than is the case in other, more developed countries.
Additionally, the Companys business involves the use of agents and other intermediaries, such as customs clearance brokers, in these countries as well as others. As a result, the risk to the Company of compliance violations is increased because actions taken by any of them when attempting to conduct business on our behalf could be imputed to us by law enforcement authorities.
The Company is subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that expose the Company to potential liability and proposed new regulations that would restrict activities to which the Company currently provides equipment and services.
The Companys operations are subject to a variety of national and state, provincial and local laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. The Company is required to invest financial and managerial resources to comply with these laws and expects to continue to do so in the future. To date, the cost of complying with governmental regulation has not been material, but the fact that such laws or regulations are frequently changed makes it impossible for the Company to predict the cost or impact of such laws and regulations on the Companys future operations. The modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations imposing more stringent environmental restrictions could adversely affect the Company.
The Company provides equipment and services to companies employing hydraulic fracturing or fracking and could be adversely impacted by additional regulations of this enhanced recovery technique.
Environmental concerns have been raised regarding the potential impact on underground water supplies of hydraulic fracturing which involves the pumping of water and certain chemicals under pressure into a well to break apart shale and other rock formations in order to increase the flow of oil and gas embedded in these formations. Recently, a number of U.S. states have proposed regulations regarding disclosure of chemicals used in fracking operations or have temporarily suspended issuance of permits for such operations. The State of New York recently announced a statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing beginning in 2015 which would limit natural gas production from a portion of the Marcellus Shale region. Additionally, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued rules, which became effective in January 2015, that are designed to limit the release of volatile organic compounds, or pollutants, from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured. The EPA has published draft permitting guidance for oil and gas hydraulic fracturing activities using diesel fuels and is continuing to study whether the fracking process has any negative impact on underground water supplies. Should these regulations, or additional regulations and bans by governments, restrict or curtail hydraulic fracturing activities, the Companys revenues and earnings could be negatively impacted.
Enacted and proposed climate protection regulations and legislation may impact the Companys operations or those of its customers.
The EPA has made a finding under the United States Clean Air Act that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare and the EPA has enacted regulations requiring monitoring and reporting by certain facilities and companies of greenhouse gas emissions. In June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court prohibited the EPA from being able to require limits on carbon dioxide and other heat trapping gases from sources that would otherwise not need an air pollution permit.
Also, in June 2014, the EPA, acting under President Obamas Climate Action Plan, proposed its Clean Power Plan, which would set U.S. state-by-state guidelines for power plants to meet by 2030 to cut their carbon emissions by 30% nationwide from 2005 levels. The guidelines are also intended to cut pollution, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide by more than 25% during the same period. Under the Clean Power Plan, states are to develop plans to meet state-specific goals to reduce carbon pollution and submit those plans to the EPA by June 2016, with a later deadline provided under certain circumstances. While these proposed rules may hasten the switch from coal to cleaner burning fuels such as natural gas, the overall long-term economic impact of the plan is uncertain at this point.
Carbon emission reporting and reduction programs have also expanded in recent years at the state, regional and national levels with certain countries having already implemented various types of cap-and-trade programs aimed at reducing carbon emissions from companies that currently emit greenhouse gases.
17 Table of Contents To the extent the Companys customers are subject to these or other similar proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations, the Company is exposed to risks that the additional costs by customers to comply with such laws and regulations could impact their ability or desire to continue to operate at current or anticipated levels in certain jurisdictions, which could negatively impact their demand for the Companys products and services.
To the extent Cameron becomes subject to any of these or other similar proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations, the Company expects that its efforts to monitor, report and comply with such laws and regulations, and any related taxes imposed on companies by such programs, will increase the Companys cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions, including the United States, and may require expenditures on a number of its facilities and possibly on modifications of certain of its products.
The Company could also be impacted by new laws and regulations establishing cap-and-trade and those that might favor the increased use of non-fossil fuels, including nuclear, wind, solar and bio-fuels or that are designed to increase energy efficiency. If the proposed or newly executed laws have the effect of dampening demand for oil and gas production, they could lower spending by customers for the Companys products and services.
Environmental Remediation The Companys worldwide operations are subject to domestic and international regulations with regard to air, soil and water quality as well as other environmental matters. The Company, through its Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) Management System and corporate third-party regulatory compliance audit program, believes it is in substantial compliance with these regulations.
The Company is heir to a number of older manufacturing plants that conducted operations in accordance with the standards of the time, but which have since changed. The Company has undertaken clean-up efforts at these sites and now conducts its business in accordance with todays standards. The Companys clean-up efforts have yielded limited releases of liability from regulators in some instances, and have allowed sites with no current operations to be sold. The Company conducts environmental due diligence prior to all new site acquisitions. For further information, refer to Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.
Environmental Sustainability The Company has pursued environmental sustainability in a number of ways. Processes are monitored in an attempt to produce the least amount of waste. All of the waste disposal firms used by the Company are carefully selected in an attempt to prevent any future Superfund involvements. Actions are taken in an attempt to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes and to minimize air emissions. Recycling of process water is a common practice. Best management practices are used in an effort to prevent contamination of soil and ground water on the Companys sites.
Cameron has implemented a corporate HSE Management System that incorporates many of the principles of ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001. The HSE Management System contains a set of corporate standards that are required to be implemented and verified by each business unit. Cameron has also implemented a corporate third-party regulatory compliance audit program to verify facility compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. The compliance program employs or uses independent third-party auditors to audit facilities on a regular basis specific to country, region, and local legal requirements. Audit reports are circulated to the senior management of the Company and to the appropriate business unit.

Cameron believes its facilities are suitable for their present and intended purposes and are adequate for the Companys current and anticipated level of operations.
ITEM 3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is subject to a number of contingencies, including litigation, tax contingencies and environmental matters.
Litigation The Company has been and continues to be named as a defendant in a number of multi-defendant, multi-plaintiff tort lawsuits. At December 31, 2014, the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet included a liability of approximately $17 million for such cases. The Company believes, based on its review of the facts and law, that the potential exposure from these suits will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
19 Table of Contents Tax and Other Contingencies The Company has legal entities in over 50 countries. As a result, the Company is subject to various tax filing requirements in these countries. The Company prepares its tax filings in a manner which it believes is consistent with such filing requirements. However, some of the tax laws and regulations to which the Company is subject require interpretation and/or judgment. Although the Company believes the tax liabilities for periods ending on or before the balance sheet date have been adequately provided for in the financial statements, to the extent a taxing authority believes the Company has not prepared its tax filings in accordance with the authoritys interpretation of the tax laws and regulations, the Company could be exposed to additional taxes.
The Company has been assessed customs duties and penalties by the government of Brazil totaling almost $50 million at December 31, 2014, including interest accrued at local country rates, following a customs audit for the years 2003-2010. The Company filed an administrative appeal and believes a majority of this assessment will ultimately be proven to be incorrect because of numerous errors in the assessment, and because the government has not provided appropriate supporting documentation for the assessment. As a result, the Company currently expects no material adverse impact on its results of operations or cash flows as a result of the ultimate resolution of this matter. No amounts have been accrued for this assessment as of December 31, 2014 as no loss is currently considered probable.
Environmental Matters The Company is currently identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) for one site designated for cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) or similar state law. The Osborne site is a landfill into which a predecessor of the Reciprocating Compression operation in Grove City, Pennsylvania deposited waste, where remediation was completed in 2011 and remaining costs relate to ongoing ground water monitoring. The Company is also a party with de minimis exposure at other CERCLA sites.
The Company is engaged in site cleanup under the Voluntary Cleanup Plan of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality ("TCEQ") at a former manufacturing location in Houston, Texas and had been engaged in oneat aformer manufacturing locationin Missouri City, Texas. With respect to the Missouri City site, the Company received a Certificate of Completion from the TCEQ on February 17, 2015. With respect to the Houston site, in 2001, the Company discovered that contaminated underground water had migrated under an adjacent residential area. Pursuant to applicable state regulations, the Company notified the affected homeowners. Concerns over the impact on property values of the underground water contamination and its public disclosure led to a number of claims by homeowners. The Company has settled these claims, primarily as a result of the settlement of a class action lawsuit, and is obligated to reimburse approximately 190 homeowners for any diminution in value of their property due to contamination concerns at the time of the property's sale. Test results of monitoring wells on the southeastern border of the plume indicate that the plume is moving in a new direction, likely as a result of a ground water drainage system completed as part of an interstate highway improvement project. As a result, the Company notified 39 additional homeowners, and may provide notice to additional homeowners, whose property is adjacent to the class area that their property may be affected. The Company continues to monitor the situation to determine whether additional remedial measures would be appropriate. The Company believes, based on its review of the facts and law, that any potential exposure from existing agreements as well as any possible new claims that may be filed with respect to this underground water contamination will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. The Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet included a noncurrent liability of approximately $7 million for these matters as of December 31, 2014.
Additionally, the Company has discontinued operations at a number of other sites which had been active for many years and which may have yet undiscovered contamination. The Company does not believe, based upon information currently available, that there are any material environmental liabilities existing at these locations. At December 31, 2014, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet included a noncurrent liability of nearly $3 million for these environmental matters.
The Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 The Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, passed by the United States Congress and signed into law in August 2012, requires companies to report certain prohibited activities or conduct that were knowingly engaged in by the company or any of its affiliates involving Iran or other parties named therein. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company had no such activities or conduct to report.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of the historical results of operations and financial condition of Cameron International Corporation (the Company or Cameron) should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. All per share amounts attributable to Cameron stockholders included in this discussion are based on diluted shares outstanding.
Overview Cameron provides flow equipment products, systems and services to worldwide oil and gas industries through four business segments  Subsea, Surface, Drilling and Valves & Measurement (V&M).
The Subsea segment delivers integrated solutions, products, systems and services to the subsea oil and gas market, including integrated subsea production systems involving wellheads, subsea trees, manifolds and flowline connectors, subsea processing systems for the enhanced recovery of hydrocarbons, control systems, connectors and services designed to maximize reservoir recovery and extend the life of each field. The Subsea segment includes the operations of OneSubsea, a business jointly owned by Cameron (60%) and Schlumberger (40%).
The Surface segment provides onshore and offshore platform wellhead systems and processing solutions, including valves, chokes, actuators, Christmas trees and services to oil and gas operators. Rental equipment and artificial lift technologies are also provided, as well as products and services involving shale gas production.
One of the major services provided by the Surface segment is CAMSHALE Production Solutions, which specializes in shale gas production. In this process, intense pressure from fracing fluid (usually a mixture of water and sand) is used to crack surrounding shale. Once the fractures are made, the water is removed from the well bore and the sand is left behind to hold the fractures open. Oil and natural gas then moves out of the fractures, into the well bore, and up to the surface.
The Drilling segment provides drilling equipment and services to shipyards, drilling contractors, exploration & production operators and rental tool companies. Products fall into two broad categories: pressure control equipment and rotary drilling equipment and are designed for either onshore or offshore applications. Such products include drilling equipment packages, blowout preventers (BOPs), BOP control systems, connectors, riser systems, valve and choke manifold systems, topdrives, mud pumps, pipe handling equipment, rig designs and rig kits.
The V&M segment businesses serve portions of the upstream, midstream and downstream markets. These businesses provide valves and measurement systems that are primarily used to control, direct and measure the flow of oil and gas as they are moved from wellheads through flow lines, gathering lines and transmission systems to refineries, petrochemical plants and industrial centers for processing. Products include gate valves, butterfly valves, Orbit brand rising stem ball valves, double block and bleed valves, plug valves, globe valves, check valves, actuators, chokes and parts and services as well as measurement equipment products such as totalizers, turbine meters, flow computers, chart recorders, ultrasonic flow meters and sampling systems.
Exposure to offshore markets The Companys broad portfolio of products results in Cameron having a significant presence in the offshore oil and gas drilling, production and infrastructure market. Cameron provides drilling equipment packages for drilling rigs, drilling and production risers, subsea production systems, oil and gas separation equipment, chokes, valves and other equipment to the offshore market. Approximately 62% of the Companys 2014 revenue was derived from the offshore market (51% in 2013).
23 Table of Contents Exposure to international markets Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were generated from shipments to the following regions of the world ( dollars in millions ): Region 2014 2013 2012 North America $ 3,739 $ 3,557 $ 3,514 South America 783 772 557 Asia, including Middle East 2,334 2,134 1,681 Africa 1,541 966 890 Europe 1,816 1,415 807 Other 168 294 346 Total revenues $ 10,381 $ 9,138 $ 7,795 Financial Summary The following table sets forth the consolidated percentage relationship to revenues of certain income statement items for the periods presented: Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Revenues 100 % 100 % 100 % Costs and expenses: Cost of sales ( exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below ) 71.9 71.3 70.8 Selling and administrative expenses 12.4 13.9 13.7 Depreciation and amortization 3.4 3.3 3.1 Interest, net 1.2 1.1 1.2 Other costs ( see Note 4 ) 0.7 1.0 0.4 Total costs and expenses 89.6 90.6 89.2 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 10.4 9.4 10.8 Income tax provision (2.5 ) (2.2 ) (2.0 ) Income from continuing operations 7.9 7.2 8.8 Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 0.3 0.7 0.8 Net income 8.2 7.9 9.6 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 0.4 0.3 - Net income attributable to Cameron stockholders 7.8 % 7.6 % 9.6 % 24 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013 Market Conditions Information related to a measure of drilling activity and certain commodity spot and futures prices during each year and the number of available deepwater floaters at the end of each period follows: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2014 2013 Amount % Drilling activity ( average number of working rigs during period ) 1 : United States 1,861 1,761 100 5.7 % Canada 380 355 25 7.0 % Rest of world 1,337 1,296 41 3.2 % Global average rig count 3,578 3,412 166 4.9 % Commodity prices ( average of daily U.S. dollar prices per unit during period ) 2 : West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Cushing, OK crude spot price ( per barrel ) $ 93.03 $ 98.01 $ (4.98 ) (5.1 )% Brent crude spot price (per barrel) $ 99.01 $ 105.76 $ (6.75 ) (6.4 )% Henry Hub natural gas spot price ( per MMBtu ) $ 4.35 $ 3.73 $ 0.62 16.6 % Twelve-month futures strip price ( U.S. dollar amount at period end ) 2 : West Texas Intermediate Cushing, OK crude oil contract ( per barrel ) $ 56.57 $ 95.79 $ (39.22 ) (40.9 )% Brent crude oil contract (per barrel) $ 57.33 $ 110.80 $ (53.47 ) (48.3 )% Henry Hub natural gas contract ( per MMBtu ) $ 3.06 $ 4.19 $ (1.13 ) (27.0 )% Contracted drillships and semi submersibles by location 3 : U.S. Gulf of Mexico 53 46 7 15.2 % Central and South America 63 73 (10 ) (13.7 )% Northwestern Europe 44 47 (3 ) (6.4 )% West Africa 41 39 2 5.1 % Southeast Asia and Australia 28 27 1 3.7 % Other 49 48 1 2.1 % Total 278 280 (2 ) (0.7 )% 1 Based on average monthly rig count data from Baker Hughes 2 Source: Bloomberg 3 Source: IHS  Petrodata Drilling activity was generally strong for the first nine months of 2014 and then began to weaken toward the end of the year as commodity prices dropped sharply in the fourth quarter and continued their rapid decline during early 2015. We believe these declines in commodity prices will significantly reduce drilling activity levels in 2015, which will lower the demand for our products and services. Although the Company has a substantial backlog of work that is scheduled to be executed during 2015, weaker demand for our products and services is expected to have an adverse impact on new orders, revenues and earnings. Based on the Companys long history in the energy sector, we believe such declines in commodity prices and demand are cyclical in nature. During such cyclical downturns, we take steps to adjust our commercial, manufacturing and support operations as appropriate to ensure that the Company remains competitive and financially sound. The Company cannot predict the duration or depth of this down-cycle.
25 Table of Contents The increase in drilling rig activity during 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in North American rigs drilling for oil and higher activity levels in most major regions of the world, except Latin America. Despite the improvement in natural gas pricing for much of 2014, overall average drilling activity levels reflected only a modest improvement. The average number of rigs drilling for gas was down in North America during 2014 as compared to 2013. Rigs drilling for gas were approximately 18% of the total North American rig count in December 2014 compared to 21% in December 2013. While December 2014 rig count levels were near the averages for the full year, there was a 7% drop in the average global rig count level in January 2015, mainly as the result of a nearly 11% drop in the average U.S. rig count, reflecting the impact of the decline in commodity prices during the latter half of 2014.
Crude oil prices trended downward during the second half of 2014. For example, after reaching a high of $107.62 in late July, WTI crude prices closed the year at $53.27 per barrel, a decline of over 50%. The twelve month futures price for crude oil at December 31, 2014 was approximately 6% higher than spot prices at the end of the year. Prices for Brent crude followed a similar trend, ending the year with a $57.33 futures strip price, or 8% lower than the closing spot price. The year-end Brent crude spot price was down 44% from mid-year levels.
Natural gas prices were fairly consistent for much of 2014, averaging $4.35 per MMBtu at Henry Hub, which is a 17% increase as compared to 2013, although prices began to decline near the end of 2014. The 12-month futures strip price for natural gas at December 31, 2014 was $3.06 per MMBtu at Henry Hub, which is comparable to the spot price of $2.99 at December 31, 2014.
The total number of drillships and semi-submersibles available for contract and under contract at December 31, 2014 were generally consistent with the prior year with some redeployment occurring away from Central and South America to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and certain other regions of the world. At December 31, 2014, the supply of available semisubmersibles and drillships currently exceeds demand with additional supply expected to come on-line during 2015. In connection with this and in response to current market conditions, certain drilling contractors have previously announced plans to cold stack or scrap certain older rigs in their existing portfolio during 2015.
Results of Operations Consolidated Results  2014 Compared to 2013 Net income attributable to Cameron stockholders for 2014 totaled $811 million, compared to $699 million for 2013. These amounts included $26 million and $65 million, respectively, of income from discontinued operations for 2014 and 2013. Discontinued operations include the Companys Reciprocating Compression business sold in June 2014 and the Centrifugal Compression business for which the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell in August 2014 (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information). The closing of the sale of Centrifugal Compression was effective January 1, 2015. Consolidated net income also includes $37 million and $25 million, respectively, of income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2014 and 2013.
Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share attributable to Cameron stockholders totaled $3.83 in 2014, compared to $2.60 in 2013. Included in the 2014 and 2013 results were other costs, totaling $0.31 and $0.29 per diluted share, respectively, as described further below.
Absent these costs, diluted earnings from continuing operations per share attributable to Cameron stockholders would have been $4.14 in 2014 and $2.89 in 2013, an increase of approximately 43%.
Total revenues for the Company increased $1.2 billion, or 13.6%, during 2014 as compared 2013. The vast majority of the increase was attributable to higher revenues in the Drilling and Surface segments reflecting the impact of higher beginning-of-the-year backlog and continued strength throughout a good portion of 2014 in North American activity levels. Revenues in the Subsea business were also up 9%, whereas V&M segment revenues were essentially flat with 2013.
As a percent of revenues, cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased from 71.3% during 2013 to 71.9% for 2014, mainly as a result of lower product margins in the Surface and V&M segments largely relating to pricing pressures and higher costs. Comments regarding margins in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations refer to Revenues minus Cost of Sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) as shown separately on the Companys Consolidated Results of Operations Statement for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014.
Selling and administrative expenses increased $12 million, or 1%, during 2014 as compared to 2013. Selling and administrative expenses were 12.4% of revenues for 2014, down from 13.9% for 2013, reflecting the impact of cost control efforts throughout the Company.
26 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $348 million for 2014 as compared to $298 million during 2013, an increase of $50 million. The increase was due primarily to higher depreciation expense as a result of recent increased levels of capital spending, mainly in the Subsea and Surface segments.
Net interest increased $29 million, from $100 million during 2013 to $129 million during 2014, mainly as a result of additional interest associated with (i) $750 million of new senior notes issued by the Company in December 2013, and (ii) $500 million of new senior notes issued in June 2014.
During 2014, the Company incurred $73 million of other costs, net of credits, as compared to $92 million in 2013. These other costs (credits) consisted of: Year Ended December 31, ( dollars in millions ) 2014 2013 Goodwill impairment $ 40 $  Litigation costs 11 3 Loss on disposal of non-core assets 10  Impairment of identifiable intangible assets 4  Cost for early retirement of debt 3  OneSubsea formation and other acquisition and integration costs 2 60 International pension curtailment gains, net (8 )  Gain from remeasurement of prior interest in equity method investment (8 )  Mark-to-market impact on currency derivatives not designated as accounting hedges 8 1 Currency devaluation  10 Severance, restructuring and other costs 11 18 Total other costs $ 73 $ 92 The Companys effective tax rate for 2014 was 23.9% compared to 22.9% during 2013. The components of the effective tax rates for both years were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 ( dollars in millions ) Tax Provision Tax Rate Tax Provision Tax Rate Provision based on statutory rates in jurisdictions where income is earned $ 254 23.5 % $ 193 22.5 % Adjustments to income tax provision : Recognition of certain historical tax benefits as prior uncertainty regarding those benefits has been resolved (5 ) (0.5 ) (16 ) (1.9 ) Tax effect of goodwill impairment 9 0.9   Finalization of prior year returns 17 1.6 29 3.4 Tax effects of changes in legislation 2 0.2 (10 ) (1.1 ) Accrual adjustments and other (19 ) (1.8 )   Tax provision $ 258 23.9 % $ 196 22.9 % Segment Results  2014 Compared to 2013 Segment revenues and operating income before interest and income taxes represent the results of activities involving third-party customers and transactions with other segments. Segment operating income before interest and income taxes represents the profit remaining in the segment after deducting third-party and intersegment cost of sales, selling and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense from third-party and intersegment revenues.

Segment operating income before interest and income taxes as a percent of revenues Segment operating income before interest and income taxes as a percent of revenues improved in 2014 as compared to 2013, due mainly to better margin performance on large subsea projects and cost control efforts that limited increases in selling and administrative expenses. Partially offsetting this improvement was increased depreciation and amortization expense, largely associated with higher amortization of purchased intangibles and additional capital spending in recent periods.
Orders Orders declined significantly in 2014 as compared to 2013, a year in which there were four large project awards received covering more than 90 new subsea trees and two large project awards for custom processing equipment. No similar-sized large subsea or custom processing equipment orders were received in 2014.
Backlog (at period-end) A decline in new project awards during 2014, along with increased revenues, were the main drivers for the reduction in backlog levels at December 31, 2014 as compared to December 31, 2013.

Segment operating income before interest and income taxes as a percent of revenues Segment operating income before interest and income taxes as a percent of revenues was flat in 2014 as compared to 2013 as overall cost increases mostly mirrored the increase in revenues during 2014.
28 Table of Contents Orders Orders were up modestly in 2014 as compared to 2013 as increased activity levels, along with higher market penetration in various North American unconventional resource regions, more than compensated for a decline in 2014 demand from customers operating in Iraq, in comparison to the strong order levels received for that region in 2013.
Backlog (at period-end) The increase in segment backlog at December 31, 2014 as compared to December 31, 2013 was entirely due to new equipment order rates exceeding deliveries during the year.

Segment operating income before interest and income taxes as a percent of revenues The increase in segment operating income before interest and income taxes as a percent of revenues in 2014 as compared to 2013 was due primarily to cost control efforts which limited the amount of increase in selling and administrative expenses as compared to 2013.
Orders Order rates declined in 2014 as compared to 2013 as a result of a slowdown in large rig construction and drilling stack project awards in 2014, partially offset by a modest improvement in orders for services.
Backlog (at period-end) Backlog at December 31, 2014 decreased from December 31, 2013 mainly due to the slowdown in large rig construction and drilling stack project awards in 2014, as described above.
V&M Segment Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) (dollars in millions ) 2014 2013 $ % Revenues $ 2,125 $ 2,105 $ 20 1.0 % Segment operating income before interest and income taxes $ 393 $ 414 $ (21 ) (5.1 )% Segment operating income before interest and income taxes as a percent of revenues 18.5 % 19.7 % N/A (1.2 ) pts.
Orders $ 2,091 $ 2,086 $ 5 0.2 % Backlog ( at period-end ) $ 921 $ 1,017 $ (96 ) (9.4 )% 29 Table of Contents Revenues Overall, segment revenues for 2014 were relatively flat when compared to 2013 as increased sales of distributed valves and measurement products, mainly resulting from continued strength in the North American market for much of the year, were mostly offset by lower engineered and process valves sales due largely to project slippage, recent order weakness and delayed timing of valve deliveries due to various customer changes.
Segment operating income before interest and income taxes as a percent of revenues The ratio of segment operating income before interest and income taxes as a percent of revenues declined in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to lower engineered and process valve product margins, resulting mainly from pricing pressures and the impact of higher manufacturing costs, partially offset by lower selling and administrative costs.
Orders Orders were essentially flat in 2014 as compared to 2013. Higher North American activity levels for much of 2014 resulted in full year order increases for distributed valves and measurement products. Sequentially, however, order rates declined in both product lines in the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to the third quarter of 2014 as a result of weakening commodity prices and activity levels during the latter half of 2014.
The full year product line increases described above were largely offset by a decline in demand for both engineered and process valves resulting mainly from project slippage and customer spending constraints associated with large international production expansion projects.
Backlog (at period-end) Backlog levels for the V&M segment at December 31, 2014 decreased from December 31, 2013, as recent order rates for new engineered and process valves have not kept pace with recent deliveries. These decreases were partially offset by strong demand for distributed valves during much of 2014.
Corporate Expenses Corporate expenses were $145 million for 2014, a decline of $17 million from $162 million in 2013. The decrease was due primarily to lower spending associated with the Companys information technology systems and lower costs associated with various legal matters.

During 2013, rig count levels dropped to their lowest point in May before recovering 9% by December. Average worldwide rig count levels for the month of December 2013 were up 3% from the average number of rigs operating during the month of December 2012 but were down 11% from February 2012, the highest monthly average level of operating rigs counted during the last ten year period.
The decline during 2013 in the average annual United States rig count was the result of a 31% decline in the average number of working gas rigs. Oil rigs accounted for 78% of the average 2013 U.S. rig count compared to 71% for 2012. The U.S. rig count level during the month of December 2013 increased from earlier months in the year and was just under the average U.S. rig count level for the month of December 2012.
A decline in the average number of operating oil rigs accounted for the drop in the average Canadian rig count from 2012 to 2013. Oil rigs accounted for nearly 66% of the average 2013 Canadian rig count compared to almost 72% for 2012.
31 Table of Contents For the rest of the world, increased drilling activity in Africa contributed to almost half of the 5% increase in average operating rigs in 2013 as compared to 2012.
WTI crude oil prices during 2013 went from a low of under $87 per barrel in April to a high of over $110 per barrel in September before declining during the remainder of the year to close at $98.42 per barrel at December 31, 2013, in line with the average daily price for the year and up 7% from the closing price at December 31, 2012. The 12-month futures strip price for WTI crude oil was $95.79 at December 31, 2013, down 3% from 2013s year-end closing spot price. In comparison, Brent crude oil spot prices averaged almost $106 per barrel for 2013, compared to $109 per barrel in 2012.
Natural gas spot prices trended upward throughout much of 2013 from a low of $3.08 per MMBtu at Henry Hub in January to a high of $4.52 per MMBtu at Henry Hub during December. The December 31, 2013 closing price was 26% higher than the closing price at December 31, 2012. However, the 12-month futures strip price for natural gas at Henry Hub at December 31, 2013 was $4.19, down 3% from 2013s year-end closing price, but up 12% from the average 2013 price level.
The decline during 2012 in the price of natural gas negatively affected gas drilling activity levels in North America and order rates that year for certain of the Companys products used in natural gas drilling and production, in particular distributed valves, which serve this market. Although natural gas prices recovered somewhat during 2013 from 2012 levels, North American gas rig count levels did not show a similar recovery during that same period.
Results of Operations Consolidated Results  2013 Compared to 2012 Net income attributable to Cameron stockholders for 2013 was $699 million compared to $751 million for 2012. These amounts included $65 million and $66 million, respectively, of income from discontinued operations for 2013 and 2012. Consolidated net income for 2013 also includes $25 million of income attributable to noncontrolling interests (none for 2012).
Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share attributable to Cameron stockholders for 2013 were $2.60 down from $2.76 per share in 2012. The Company incurred approximately $0.29 per share of other costs in 2013, as described further below. Such other costs in 2012 amounted to approximately $0.11 per share. Absent these costs, the Companys diluted earnings per share from continuing operations would have been $2.89 in 2013 compared to $2.87 in 2012, an increase of approximately 1%.
Total revenues for the Company increased by $1.3 billion, or 17.2%, from $7.8 billion in 2012 to $9.1 billion for 2013, with the improvement noted mainly in the Subsea and Drilling segments. Businesses acquired since the beginning of 2012 accounted for approximately 34% of the increase. Absent the effect of these newly acquired businesses, revenues climbed 11% in 2013 as compared to 2012. A further discussion of revenues by segment may be found below.
As a percent of revenues, cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased from 70.8% in 2012 to 71.3% for 2013. The increase was due largely to execution issues in the Drilling segment.
Selling and administrative expenses increased $205 million, or 19.2%, during 2013 as compared to 2012.
As a percent of revenues, selling and administrative expenses increased from 13.7% in 2012 to 13.9% in 2013.
Higher employee and facility-related costs as a result of increased headcount, business volumes and international and services expansion efforts, particularly in the Surface and Drilling segments, accounted for most of the dollar increase.
Depreciation and amortization increased $60 million, or 25.2%, during 2013 as compared to 2012 mainly due to:  increased capital spending in recent periods primarily for (i) expansion of the fleet of rental equipment available in the Surface segment, (ii) enhancing the manufacturing capacity in the Drilling segment, and (iii) development of the Companys enhanced business information systems as well as,  the impact of newly acquired businesses, which accounted for nearly 46% of the increase in costs during 2013.
Net interest for 2013 totaled $100 million, an increase of $10 million from 2012. The increase was due mainly to (i) the full year impact of interest during 2013 on the $500 million principal amount of debt issued in May 2012 and (ii) the $750 million principal amount of debt issued in December 2013, as well as additional interest associated with prior years income tax liabilities.
32 Table of Contents During 2013, the Company incurred $92 million of other costs as compared to $33 million in 2012. These other costs consisted of: Year Ended December 31, ( dollars in millions ) 2013 2012 OneSubsea formation and other acquisition and integration costs $ 60 $ 16 Currency devaluation 10  Impairment of identifiable intangible assets  18 International pension settlement costs  7 Litigation costs 3 2 Mark-to-market impact on currency derivatives not designated as accounting hedges 1 (16 ) Severance, restructuring and other costs 18 6 Total other costs $ 92 $ 33 The Companys effective tax rate for 2013 was 22.9% compared to 18.6% during 2012. The components of the effective tax rates for both years were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 ( dollars in millions ) Tax Provision Tax Rate Tax Provision Tax Rate Provision based on statutory rates in jurisdictions where income is earned $ 193 22.5 % $ 206 24.4 % Adjustments to income tax provision : Recognition of certain historical tax benefits as prior uncertainty regarding those benefits has been resolved (16 ) (1.9 ) (22 ) (2.6 ) Finalization of prior year returns 29 3.4 (21 ) (2.5 ) Tax effects of changes in legislation (10 ) (1.1 ) (2 ) (0.2 ) Accrual adjustments and other   (4 ) (0.5 ) Tax provision $ 196 22.9 % $ 157 18.6 % Segment Results  2013 Compared to 2012 Subsea Segment Year Ended December 31, Increase (dollars in millions ) 2013 2012 $ % Revenues $ 2,813 $ 2,061 $ 752 36.5 % Segment operating income before interest and income taxes $ 152 $ 72 $ 80 111.1 % Segment operating income before interest and income taxes as a percent of revenues 5.4 % 3.5 % N/A 1.9 pts.

33 Table of Contents Segment operating income before interest and income taxes as a percent of revenues Segment operating income before interest and income taxes as a percent of revenues increased in 2013 as compared to 2012 mainly as a result of improved margins on large subsea projects, as well as stronger volumes and better absorption of costs in the process systems product line.
Orders Orders increased significantly in 2013 as compared to 2012 largely due to (i) an 87% increase in the number of new subsea trees awarded in 2013, mainly for projects offshore Brazil and in the UK North Sea, (ii) an award of nearly $250 million for a gas processing facility in Malaysia, and (iii) the impact of businesses contributed by Schlumberger upon the formation of OneSubsea in June 2013, which accounted for almost 19% of the increase.
Backlog (at period-end) Similar to orders, backlog at December 31, 2013 was significantly higher than at December 31, 2012. Nearly 25% of the increase in backlog from December 31, 2012 was due to the impact of businesses contributed by Schlumberger as part of the formation of OneSubsea in June 2013. The remaining increase largely reflected the high level of new major project awards received in 2013, as described above.

Partially offsetting this improvement was a significant decline in revenues for wellhead processing equipment and services, primarily in North America.
Segment operating income before interest and income taxes as a percent of revenues Segment operating income before interest and income taxes as a percent of revenues increased in 2013 as compared to 2012. Improved product margins, resulting mainly from better price realization and product mix on various international projects, was partially offset by (i) higher depreciation and amortization expense from purchased intangibles and recent capital spending for the expansion of the fleet of rental equipment available and (ii) increased selling and administrative expenses largely associated with higher employee-related costs.
Orders Orders increased during 2013 as compared to 2012 mainly as a result of (i) high demand for new equipment in Saudi Arabia and Iraq, (ii) higher activity levels, increased market penetration and rental equipment deployments in North America, and (iii) increased demand for equipment in the U.K. North Sea and the Caspian Sea. Partially offsetting these gains was a significant decline in demand for wellhead processing equipment and services, primarily in North America.
Backlog (at period-end) Increased levels of demand during 2013 resulted in the increase in backlog from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013.

Segment operating income before interest and income taxes as a percent of revenues Segment operating income before interest and income taxes as a percent of revenues decline in 2013 as compared to 2012 mainly due to a decrease in margins largely related to project execution issues and the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2012, which carried higher costs than certain other preexisting businesses in this segment.
Orders Orders declined in 2013 as compared to 2012, a year which included a large project award for a complete drilling equipment package for a new ultra-deepwater drillship and various large awards for drilling stacks for new drillship construction and as spares for existing rigs. This same level of awards received in 2012 did not repeat in 2013. Partially offsetting this decline was the impact of orders added from new businesses acquired since the beginning of 2012 and an increase in activity levels associated with the Companys services.
Backlog (at period-end) Backlog increased at December 31, 2013 as compared to December 31, 2012, mainly as a result of orders for new equipment and services exceeding revenues during the year.

Segment operating income before interest and income taxes as a percent of revenues Segment operating income before interest and income taxes as a percent of revenues increased in 2013 as compared to 2012 due primarily to improved product margins in all product lines, mainly resulting from better pricing, which was partially offset by higher employee-related expenses, higher consulting expenditures and increased costs resulting from expansion of V&Ms international sales efforts.
35 Table of Contents Orders Orders in 2013 declined modestly from 2012 as a result of decreased demand for engineered and process valves due to pipeline project delays and lower major infrastructure project awards. This was mostly offset by higher demand for distributed valves resulting from higher North American activity levels and changes in stocking requirements by distributors.
Backlog (at period-end) Backlog levels at December 31, 2013 decreased from December 31, 2012 in all product lines, except for measurement products, as order rates, mainly for new engineered and process valves, did not keep up with deliveries during 2013.
Corporate Expenses Corporate expenses totaled $162 million in 2013 as compared to $126 million in 2012, an increase of $36 million. The increase mainly reflects (i) increased spending in connection with the implementation of the Companys new enterprise-wide information technology system, (ii) higher costs for various legal matters, and (ii) higher employee-related costs due to increased headcount and incentive compensation.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated statements of cash flows Net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of $355 million, from the $838 million of cash provided by operating activities during 2013. The 2014 amount was partially offset by approximately $100 million of tax payments made during the year associated with the pre-tax gain recognized on the sale of the Reciprocating Compression business.
Cash used to increase working capital in 2014 was $5 million compared to $281 million used for working capital needs in 2013.
Cash provided by investing activities was $96 million in 2014 compared to $482 million of cash provided by investing activities in 2013. During 2014, the Company received net proceeds of $547 million from the sale of the Reciprocating Compression business. In 2013, $523 million of net proceeds, including cash acquired, was received from the formation of the OneSubsea venture with Schlumberger. Capital expenditures in 2014 totaled $385 million, down from $520 million in 2013. Over 50% of the Companys 2014 capital expenditures were in the Subsea and Surface segments, primarily to enhance the Companys manufacturing, rental fleet and service capabilities. During 2013, the Company also had a net $477 million drawdown from the Companys portfolio of short-term investments into cash and cash equivalents as compared to a net use of cash of $72 million during 2014 to build up this portfolio.
Cash used for financing activities was nearly $1.6 billion in 2014 as compared to $667 million in 2013. During 2014, the Company acquired nearly 28 million shares of treasury stock at cash cost of $1.7 billion, an increase of $216 million from $1.5 billion spent in 2013 to acquire nearly 27 million shares. Also, during 2014, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to initiate a commercial paper program with authority to issue up to $500 million in short-term debt. Under this program, the Company issued commercial paper totaling $201 million in principal amount for general corporate needs. The average term of the outstanding commercial paper as of December 31, 2014 was approximately 36 days. The Company currently anticipates being able to continue to issue new commercial paper to fund or extend outstanding commercial paper as it comes due for payment. In June 2014, the Company repaid $250 million of floating rate notes upon maturity and issued a total of $500 million of new senior notes split equally between 3- and 10-year maturities. Additionally, the Company, in July 2014, spent $253 million, which included a make-whole premium plus accrued interest, to redeem early $250 million principal amount of 1.6% Senior Notes. During 2013, the Company issued $750 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes as described more fully in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and borrowed an additional $46 million, mainly through its international subsidiaries. The Company also received $62 million of contributions from its noncontrolling interest partners during 2013.
36 Table of Contents Future liquidity requirements At December 31, 2014, the Company had nearly $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Approximately $702 million of the Companys cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at December 31, 2014 were in the OneSubsea venture. Dividends of available cash from OneSubsea to the venture partners, 40% of which would go to Schlumberger, require approval of the OneSubsea Board of Directors prior to payment. Of the remaining cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments not held by OneSubsea, $217 million was located in the United States.
Total debt at December 31, 2014 was nearly $3.1 billion, most of which was in the United States. Excluding capital leases, approximately $768 million of the debt obligations, excluding interest, have maturities within the next three-year period. The remainder of the Companys long-term debt is due in varying amounts between 2018 and 2043.
Excluding discontinued operations, the Companys backlog decreased approximately 14% from December 31, 2013, reflecting a weakening in recent order rates and as a result of the cancellation of a large drilling project award in the first quarter of 2014 totaling nearly $243 million. Orders during 2014 were down nearly 20% from the same period in 2013 due mainly to certain large subsea project awards received in 2013 that did not repeat at those levels during 2014. The timing of such large project awards are variable period-over-period. The Company views its backlog of unfilled orders, current order rates, current rig count levels and current and future expected oil and gas prices to be, in varying degrees, leading indicators of and factors in determining its estimates of future revenues, cash flows and profitability levels. Information regarding actual 2014 and 2013 average rig count and commodity price levels and forward-looking twelve-month market-traded futures prices for crude oil and natural gas are shown in more detail under the captions Market Conditions above. A more detailed discussion of orders and December 31 backlog levels by segment may be found under Segment Results for each period above.
The Company expects the recent drop in commodity prices and the weakening in activity levels to have a negative impact on its orders and revenues in 2015. However, based on its current financial condition and existing backlog levels, the Company believes that it will be able to meet its short- and longer-term liquidity needs with existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, expected cash flow from future operating activities and amounts available for borrowing under its $835 million five-year multi-currency Revolving Credit Facility, which matures on June 6, 2016, and its three-year $750 million Revolving Credit Facility, described further in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. Up to $200 million of this new facility may be used for letters of credit. At December 31, 2014, no amounts had been borrowed under the $835 million facility. The Company had issued letters of credit totaling $69 million under the new $750 million Revolving Credit Facility, leaving $681 million available for future use. The Company also believes, based on its existing current credit standing, that it will be able to continue to refinance existing debt upon maturity, if desired.
The Company has an authorized stock repurchase program whereby the Company may purchase shares directly or indirectly by way of open market transactions or structured programs, including the use of derivatives, for the Companys own account or through commercial banks or financial institutions. The program, initiated in October 2011, has had a series of authorizations by the Board of Directors totaling approximately $3.8 billion since inception. At December 31, 2014, the Company had remaining authority for future stock purchases totaling approximately $476 million.
Critical Accounting Policies The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. These policies and the other sections of the Companys Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition have been reviewed with the Companys Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
Revenue Recognition The Company generally recognizes revenue, net of sales taxes, related to products, services or rental arrangements once the following four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery of the equipment has occurred or the customer has taken title and risk of loss or services have been rendered, (iii) the price of the equipment or service is fixed and determinable and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. For engineering, procurement and construction-type contracts, revenue is generally reported on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Progress is primarily measured by the completion of milestones; however, progress for specific types of subsea and drilling systems contracts, which differ from our other contracts, is measured by the ratio of actual costs incurred to date on the project in relation to total estimated project costs. Both methods require the Company to make estimates regarding the total costs of the project, which impacts the amount of gross margin the Company recognizes in each reporting period. Under the percentage-of-completion method, the use of estimated costs to complete each contract is a significant variable in the process of determining recognized revenue and is a significant factor in accounting for contracts. All known or anticipated losses on contracts are provided for in the period they become evident. Revenues and gross profit on contracts can be significantly affected by change orders that may be approved subsequent to completion of related work. If it is not probable that costs will be recovered through a change in contract price, the costs attributable to change orders are treated as contract costs without incremental revenue. If it is probable that costs will be recovered through a change order, the costs are treated as contract costs and contract revenue is recognized to the extent of the lesser of the amounts management expects to recover or the costs expected to be incurred.
37 Table of Contents Factors that may affect future project costs and margins include the ability to properly execute the engineering and design phases consistent with our customers expectations, production efficiencies obtained, and the availability and costs of labor, materials and subcomponents. These factors can significantly impact the accuracy of the Companys estimates and can materially impact the Companys future period earnings. Approximately 31%, 31% and 26% of the Company's revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, were recognized under the percentage-of-completion method.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Cameron allocates the purchase price of acquired businesses to their identifiable tangible assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, based on their estimated fair values. The Company also typically allocates a portion of the purchase price to identifiable intangible assets, such as noncompete agreements, trademarks, trade names, patents, technology, customer relationships and backlog using various widely accepted valuation techniques such as discounted future cash flows and the relief-from-royalty and excess earnings methods. Each of these methods involves level 3 unobservable market inputs. Any remaining excess of cost over allocated fair values is recorded as goodwill. On larger acquisitions, Cameron will typically engage third-party valuation experts to assist in determining the fair values for both the identifiable tangible and intangible assets. Certain estimates and judgments are required in the application of the fair value techniques, including estimates of future cash flows, selling prices, replacement costs, royalty rates for use of assets, economic lives and the selection of a discount rate.
The Company reviews the carrying value of goodwill in accordance with accounting rules on impairment of goodwill, which require that the Company estimate the fair value of each of its reporting units annually, or when impairment indicators exist, and compare such amounts to their respective carrying values to determine if an impairment of goodwill is required. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit for the 2014, 2013 and 2012 evaluations was determined using discounted future expected cash flows (level 3 unobservable inputs) consistent with the accounting guidance for fair-value measurements. Certain estimates and judgments are required in the application of the fair value models, including, but not limited to, estimates of future cash flows and the selection of a discount rate. At December 31, 2014, the Companys reporting units for goodwill impairment evaluation purposes were the OneSubsea, Process Systems, Surface, Drilling, Valves and Measurement businesses. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2014, there were five reporting units within the V&M segment (now combined into two reporting units based on changes in managements reporting structure during the fourth quarter of 2014). Those reporting units included $311 million of goodwill. The Company performed a goodwill impairment test before and after the change in V&Ms reporting units and concluded there was no impairment.
Generally, the Company conducts its goodwill impairment review during the first quarter of each annual period. Due to the significant drop in commodity prices during the latter half of 2014 and the reorganization of the Companys reporting structure, as described above, the Company made an additional evaluation of goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2014 based upon macro factors that existed at that point in time. The fair value of our Process Systems reporting unit was estimated to be 10% to 15% higher than its carrying value as part of that evaluation. The estimated fair value for Process Systems was based on forecasted timing and success in receiving new major project awards in 2015 and beyond, the pricing and profitability of those new awards and further improvements in revenue growth and profitability rates from those achieved historically. Should our expectations prove to be incorrect due to (i) further declines in oil and gas prices and continued instability in the worldwide energy markets, (ii) unanticipated delays occurring in project awards, including unplanned project cancellations, or, (iii) an increase in interest rates, our prior estimates of future earnings, cash flows and fair value of the Process Systems business would be negatively impacted, which could lead to an impairment of goodwill for that reporting unit, possibly even as early as our annual evaluation during the first quarter of 2015. Goodwill associated with the Process Systems reporting unit at December 31, 2014 was approximately $571 million.
Intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. In such an event, the Company will determine the fair value of the asset using an undiscounted cash flow analysis of the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. If an impairment has occurred, the Company will recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the intangible asset. Additional information relating to the Companys goodwill and intangible assets may be found in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Information relating to previous impairments of intangible assets may be found in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
38 Table of Contents Contingencies The Company accrues for costs relating to litigation when such liabilities become probable and reasonably estimable. Such estimates may be based on advice from third parties, amounts specified by contract, amounts designated by legal statute or managements judgment, as appropriate. Revisions to contingent liabilities are reflected in income in the period in which different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect the Companys previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss. Amounts paid upon the ultimate resolution of contingent liabilities may be materially different from previous estimates and could require adjustments to the estimated reserves to be recognized in the period such new information becomes known. See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Uncertain Tax Positions The Company accounts for uncertainties in its income tax positions in accordance with income tax accounting rules. Rulings from tax authorities on the validity and amounts allowed for uncertain tax positions taken in current and previous income tax filings could impact the Companys estimate of the value of its uncertain tax positions in those filings. Changes in the Companys estimates are recognized as an increase or decrease in income tax expense in the period determined. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Pension and Postretirement Benefits Accounting The Company recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The measurement date for all of the Companys plans was December 31, 2014. As described more fully in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the assumptions used in calculating the pension amounts recognized in the Companys consolidated financial statements include discount rates, interest costs, expected return on plan assets, retirement and mortality rates, inflation rates, salary growth and other factors. The Company based the discount rate assumptions of its defined benefit pension plans on the average yields at December 31, 2014 of hypothetical high-quality bond portfolios (rated AA- or better) with maturities that approximately matched the estimated cash flow needs of the plans. The Companys inflation assumptions were based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The expected rates of return on plan assets were based on historical experience and estimated future investment returns taking into consideration anticipated asset allocations, investment strategy and the views of various investment professionals. During 2014, plan assets increased in value by approximately $23 million. The difference between this actual return and an estimated growth in the value of those assets of $27 million will be deferred in accumulated other elements of comprehensive income and amortized as an increase to expense over the remaining service life of the plan participants. Retirement and mortality rates were based primarily on actuarial tables that were expected to best approximate actual plan experience. In accordance with the accounting requirements for retirement plans, actual results that differ from pension and postretirement benefit plan assumptions are recorded in accumulated other elements of comprehensive income as a net actuarial gain or loss and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. At December 31, 2014, the Company had a net after-tax accumulated actuarial loss, totaling $104 million, that will be amortized as an increase in future pension expense. While the Company believes the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the Companys pension obligations and future expense.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions used in (i) the calculation of pension expense for the year ending December 31, 2015 and (ii) the calculation of the projected benefit obligation (PBO) at December 31, 2014 for the Companys most significant pension plan, the United Kingdom pension plan: ( dollars in millions ) Increase (decrease) in 2015 pre-tax pension expense Increase (decrease) in PBO at December 31, 2014 Change in Assumption: 25 basis point decrease in discount rate $ (1 ) $ 15 25 basis point increase in discount rate $ (4 ) $ (14 ) 25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets $ (1 ) $  25 basis point increase in expected return on assets $ (3 ) $  39 Table of Contents Forward-looking Statement Disclaimer In addition to the historical data contained herein, this Annual Report, including the information set forth in the Companys Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this report, may include forward-looking statements regarding future market strength, customer spending and order levels, revenues and earnings of the Company, as well as expectations regarding equipment deliveries, margins, profitability, the ability to control and reduce raw material, overhead and operating costs, cash generated from operations, capital expenditures and the use of existing cash balances and future anticipated cash flows made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Companys actual results may differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. Any such statements are based on current expectations of the Companys performance and are subject to a variety of factors, some of which are not under the control of the Company, but which can affect the Companys results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. Such factors may include overall demand for, and pricing of, the Companys products; the size and timing of orders; the Companys ability to successfully execute large subsea and drilling projects it has been awarded; the possibility of cancellations of orders in backlog; the Companys ability to convert backlog into revenues on a timely and profitable basis; warranty and product liability claims; the impact of acquisitions the Company has made or may make; the potential impairment of goodwill related to such acquisitions; changes in the price of (and demand for) oil and gas in both domestic and international markets; raw material costs and availability; political and social issues affecting the countries in which the Company does business; fluctuations in currency markets worldwide; and variations in global economic activity. In particular, current and projected oil and gas prices historically have generally directly affected customers spending levels and their related purchases of the Companys products and services. As a result, changes in oil and gas price expectations may impact the demand for the Companys products and services and the Companys financial results. See additional factors discussed in Factors That May Affect Financial Condition and Future Results contained herein.
Because the information herein is based solely on data currently available, it is subject to change as a result of, among other things, changes in conditions over which the Company has no control or influence, and should not therefore be viewed as assurance regarding the Companys future performance. Additionally, the Company is not obligated to make public disclosure of such changes unless required under applicable disclosure rules and regulations.
Estimates in Financial Statements The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, estimates of total contract profit or loss on certain long-term production contracts, estimated losses on accounts receivable, estimated realizable value on excess and obsolete inventory, contingencies (including tax contingencies, estimated liabilities for litigation exposures and liquidated damages), estimated warranty costs, estimates related to pension accounting, estimates used to determine fair values in purchase accounting, estimates related to the fair value of reporting units for purposes of assessing goodwill for impairment and estimates related to deferred tax assets and liabilities, including valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
40 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The following summarizes the Companys significant cash contractual obligations and other commercial commitments for the next five years as of December 31, 2014.
(dollars in millions) Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1  3 Years 4  5 Years After 5 Years Debt, including interest payments (a) $ 4,728 $ 373 $ 763 $ 655 $ 2,937 Capital lease obligations (b) 120 17 27 14 62 Operating leases 742 102 168 122 350 Purchase obligations (c) 1,778 1,743 33 2  Minimum required contributions to funded defined benefit pension plans (d) 12 12    Benefit payments expected for unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans (U.S. only) 11 2 3 2 4 Liabilities for uncertain tax benefits (e) 96 96    Total contractual cash obligations $ 7,487 $ 2,345 $ 994 $ 795 $ 3,353 (a) For purposes of this table, the outstanding commercial paper of $201 million at December 31, 2014 is assumed to be retired upon maturity in 2015. However, the Company could choose to refinance this amount, or any amount up to $500 million, to avoid repayment during the next five years or beyond under certain conditions. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
(b) Payments shown include interest.
(c) Represents outstanding purchase orders entered into in the ordinary course of business.
(d) The Company does not estimate its future minimum required contributions beyond one year.
(e) The balance shown represents the current portion of the Companys liability for uncertain tax benefits at December 31, 2014. The remaining noncurrent balance totaling $1 million has been excluded from the table as the Company cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the associated future cash outflows.
( dollars in millions ) Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period Other Unrecorded Commercial Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Total Commitment Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 4  5 Years After 5 Years Committed lines of credit available as of year-end $ 1,740 $ 136 $ 1,604 $  $  Standby letters of credit and bank guarantees 1,108 457 392 240 19 Financial letters of credit 45 13  32  Insurance bonds 28 28    Other financial guarantees 7 1   6 Total commercial commitments $ 2,928 $ 635 $ 1,996 $ 272 $ 25 The Company secures certain contractual obligations under various agreements with its customers or other parties through the issuance of letters of credit or bank guarantees. The Company has various agreements with financial institutions to issue such instruments. At December 31, 2014, the Company had $1.1 billion of letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding in connection with the delivery, installation and performance of the Companys products. Additional letters of credit and guarantees are outstanding at December 31, 2014 in connection with certain financial obligations of the Company. Should these facilities become unavailable to the Company, the Companys operations and liquidity could be negatively impacted. Circumstances which could result in the withdrawal of such facilities include, but are not limited to, deteriorating financial performance of the Company (which could be caused by operating issues within the Company or weakness in the overall energy markets), deteriorating financial condition of the financial institutions providing such facilities, overall constriction in the credit markets, catastrophic accidents in the energy industry which could cause a contraction in the level of credit extended to the industry, or rating downgrades of the Company.
41 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is currently exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency rates and changes in interest rates. A discussion of the Companys market risk exposure in financial instruments follows.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rates A large portion of the Companys operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign jurisdictions, principally in Europe, Canada, West Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, China and other countries in the Pacific Rim. As a result, the Companys financial performance may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in these markets. Overall, for those locations where the Company is a net receiver of local non-U.S. dollar currencies, Cameron generally benefits from a weaker U.S. dollar with respect to those currencies. Alternatively, for those locations where the Company is a net payer of local non-U.S. dollar currencies, a weaker U.S. dollar with respect to those currencies will generally have an adverse impact on the Companys financial results. The impact on the Companys financial results of gains or losses arising from foreign currency denominated transactions, if material, have been described under Results of Operations in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the periods shown.
In order to mitigate the effect of exchange rate changes, the Company will often structure sales contracts to provide for collections from customers in the currency in which the Company incurs its manufacturing costs. In certain instances, the Company will enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge specific large anticipated receipts or disbursements in currencies for which the Company does not traditionally have fully offsetting local currency expenditures or receipts. The Company was party to a number of long-term foreign currency forward contracts at December 31, 2014. The purpose of the majority of these contracts was to hedge large anticipated non-functional currency cash flows on major subsea, drilling, valve or other equipment contracts involving the Companys United States operations and various wholly-owned international subsidiaries. Many of these contracts have been designated as and are accounted for as cash flow hedges, with changes in the fair value of those contracts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the period such change occurs. Certain other contracts, many of which are centrally managed, are intended to offset other foreign currency exposures but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes and, therefore, any change in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in earnings in the period such change occurs. The Company expects to expand its use of such contracts in the future.
Capital Markets and Interest Rates The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its variable-interest rate and commercial paper borrowings. Variable-rate debt, where the interest rate fluctuates periodically, exposes the Companys cash flows to variability due to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, the fair value of the Companys fixed-rate debt changes with changes in market interest rates.
The fair values of the 1.15% and 1.4% 3-year Senior Notes, the 3.6%, 3.7%, 4.0%, 4.5% and 6.375% 10-year Senior Notes and the 5.125%, 5.95% and 7.0% 30-year Senior Notes are principally dependent on prevailing interest rates. The fair value of the commercial paper is expected to approximate its book value.
The Company has various other long-term debt instruments, but believes that the impact of changes in interest rates in the near term will not be material to these instruments.
The Company has performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how market interest rate changes might affect the fair value of its debt. This analysis is inherently limited because it represents a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from the assumptions. The effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect the Companys assumptions and its rights and obligations not covered by the sensitivity analysis. Fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements.
An instantaneous one-percentage-point decrease in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would have increased the fair value of the Companys fixed-rate debt positions by approximately $238 million at December 31, 2014 ($57 million at December 31, 2013), whereas a one-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the Companys fixed-rate debt by $206 million at December 31, 2014 ($100 million at December 31, 2013). This analysis does not reflect the effect that increasing or decreasing interest rates would have on other items, such as new borrowings, nor the impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest.
42 Table of Contents Derivatives Activity Total gross volume bought (sold) by notional currency and maturity date on open derivative contracts at December 31, 2014 was as follows: Notional Amount - Buy Notional Amount - Sell ( in millions ) 2015 2016 2017 Total 2015 2016 Total Foreign exchange forward contracts - Notional currency in : Euro 200 14  214 (10 ) (1 ) (11 ) Malaysian ringgit 377 51  428 (29 )  (29 ) Norwegian krone 895 117 4 1,016 (96 ) (44 ) (140 ) Pound Sterling 110 5  115 (22 ) (1 ) (23 ) U.S. dollar 60   60 (635 ) (47 ) (682 ) Foreign exchange option contracts - Notional currency in : U.S. dollar 87   87    As described further in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the net fair value of the Companys outstanding derivatives was a $99 million liability to the Company at December 31, 2014 ($19 million benefit at December 31, 2013).
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company had approximately $1.5 billion of cash equivalents and $113 million of short-term investments at December 31, 2014. Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments which are readily convertible to cash and have maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Short-term investments have original maturities of more than three months but less than one year. Certain of these investments are valued based upon quoted or estimated market prices which represent levels 1 and 2 market inputs.
The fair value of the Companys foreign exchange forward contracts were based on quoted exchange rates for the respective currencies applicable to similar instruments (level 2 observable market inputs).
The Companys international pension plans have assets available to fund future pension obligations totaling $455 million at December 31, 2014 ($432 million at December 31, 2013). The majority of these assets are invested in debt and equity securities or mutual funds, which were valued based on quoted market prices for an individual asset (level 1 market inputs), or mutual fund unit values, which were based on the fair values of the individual securities that the fund had invested in (level 2 observable market inputs). A certain portion of the assets were invested in insurance contracts, real estate and other investments, which were valued based on level 3 unobservable inputs (see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information).
The values of these assets are subject to change, based generally on changes in market conditions involving foreign exchange rates, interest rates and debt and equity security investment pricing.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Company maintains a system of internal controls that is designed to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance as to the reliable preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures or the Companys internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of errors or fraud, if any, within Cameron have been detected.
The control environment of Cameron is the foundation for its system of internal controls over financial reporting and is embodied in the Companys Standards of Conduct. It sets the tone of the Companys organization and includes factors such as integrity and ethical values. The Companys internal controls over financial reporting are supported by formal policies and procedures that are reviewed, modified and improved as changes occur in the Companys business or as otherwise required by applicable rule-making bodies.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of outside directors, meets periodically with members of management, the internal audit department and the independent registered public accountants to review and discuss internal controls over financial reporting and accounting and financial reporting matters. The independent registered public accountants and the internal audit department report to the Audit Committee and accordingly have full and free access to the Audit Committee at any time.
Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Camerons management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) over financial reporting.
Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework). This evaluation included a review of the documentation surrounding the Companys financial controls, an evaluation of the design effectiveness of these controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of these controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Although there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal controls over financial reporting  including the possibility of the circumvention or overriding of controls  based on managements evaluation, management has concluded that the Companys internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2014, based on the framework established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (1992 framework). However, because of changes in conditions, it is important to note that internal control system effectiveness may vary over time.
Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that has audited the Companys financial statements as of and for the three-year period ended December 31, 2014, has issued a report on their audit of managements internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
/s/ Jack B. Moore Jack B. Moore Chief Executive Officer Date: February 20, 2015 /s/ Charles M. Sledge Charles M. Sledge Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Date: February 20, 2015 44 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Cameron International Corporation We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Cameron International Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (the COSO criteria). The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Cameron International Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related statements of consolidated results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in stockholders equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 and our report dated February 20, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
/s/ Ernst & Young LLP Houston, Texas February 20, 2015 45 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Cameron International Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cameron International Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related statements of consolidated results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in stockholders equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

51 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1: Summary of Major Accounting Policies Company Operations  Cameron International Corporation (Cameron or the Company) provides flow equipment products, systems and services to worldwide oil, gas and process industries through four business segments, Subsea, Surface, Drilling and Valves & Measurement (V&M). Prior to the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company reported its business segments as being Drilling & Production Systems (DPS), which included the Subsea, Drilling and Surface businesses, V&M and Process and Compression Systems, which included the Reciprocating and Centrifugal Compression businesses, both of which are now reported as discontinued operations (See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and the Processing Systems business.
Additional information regarding each segment may be found in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Principles of Consolidation  These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in affiliated companies are accounted for using the equity method when we are able to exert significant influence over the operations of the investee.
Estimates in Financial Statements  Preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, estimates of total contract profit or loss on certain long-term production contracts, estimated losses on accounts receivable, estimated realizable value on excess and obsolete inventory, contingencies (including tax contingencies, estimated liabilities for litigation exposures and liquidated damages), estimated warranty costs, estimates related to pension accounting, estimates used to determine fair values in purchase accounting, estimates related to the fair value of reporting units for purposes of assessing goodwill for impairment and estimates related to deferred tax assets and liabilities, including valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
Revenue Recognition  The Company generally recognizes revenue, net of sales taxes, related to products, services or rental arrangements once the following four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery of the equipment has occurred or the customer has taken title and risk of loss or services have been rendered, (iii) the price of the equipment or service is fixed and determinable and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. For engineering, procurement and construction-type contracts, revenue is generally reported on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Progress is primarily measured by the completion of milestones; however, progress for specific types of subsea and drilling systems contracts, which differ from our other contracts, is measured by the ratio of actual costs incurred to date on the project in relation to total estimated project costs. Both methods require the Company to make estimates regarding the total costs of the project, which impacts the amount of gross margin the Company recognizes in each reporting period. Under the percentage-of-completion method, the use of estimated costs to complete each contract is a significant variable in the process of determining recognized revenue and is a significant factor in accounting for contracts. All known or anticipated losses on contracts are provided for in the period they become evident. Revenues and gross profit on contracts can be significantly affected by change orders that may be approved subsequent to completion of related work. If it is not probable that costs will be recovered through a change in contract price, the costs attributable to change orders are treated as contract costs without incremental revenue. If it is probable that costs will be recovered through a change order, the costs are treated as contract costs and contract revenue is recognized to the extent of the lesser of the amounts management expects to recover or the costs expected to be incurred.
Approximately 31%, 31% and 26% of the Companys revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, were recognized under the percentage-of-completion method.
Shipping and Handling Costs  Shipping and handling costs are reflected in the caption entitled Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below) in the accompanying Consolidated Results of Operations statements.
Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments  Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments which are readily convertible to cash and have maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Short-term investments consist primarily of commercial paper, U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. non-governmental agency asset-backed securities and corporate debt obligations that have maturities of more than three months but less than one year. All of our short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
52 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses expected to result from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Such allowances are based upon several factors including, but not limited to, historical experience, the length of time an invoice has been outstanding, responses from customers relating to demands for payment and the current and projected financial condition of specific customers.
Inventories  Aggregate inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. On the basis of current costs, 54% of inventories at December 31, 2014 and 49% at December 31, 2013 are carried on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. For these locations, the use of LIFO results in a better matching of costs and revenues. The remaining inventories, which are generally located outside the United States and Canada, are carried on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The Company provides a reserve for estimated inventory obsolescence or excess quantities on hand equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value.
Plant and Equipment  Property, plant and equipment, both owned and under capital lease, are carried at cost. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. The cost of renewals, replacements and betterments is capitalized. The Company capitalizes software developed or obtained for internal use. Accordingly, the cost of third-party software, as well as the cost of third-party and internal personnel that are directly involved in application development activities, are capitalized during the application development phase of new software systems projects. Costs during the preliminary project stage and post-implementation stage of new software systems projects, including data conversion and training costs, are expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization is provided over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, or in the case of assets under capital leases, over the related lease term, if less, using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of the major classes of property, plant and equipment are as follows: Estimated Useful Lives Buildings and leasehold improvements 10-40 years Machinery, equipment and tooling 3-18 years Office furniture, software and other 3-10 years Goodwill and Intangible Assets  Cameron allocates the purchase price of acquired businesses to their identifiable tangible assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, based on their estimated fair values. The Company also typically allocates a portion of the purchase price to identifiable intangible assets, such as noncompete agreements, trademarks, trade names, patents, technology, customer relationships and backlog using various widely accepted valuation techniques such as discounted future cash flows and the relief-from-royalty and excess earnings methods. Each of these methods involves level 3 unobservable market inputs. Any remaining excess of cost over allocated fair values is recorded as goodwill. On larger acquisitions, Cameron will typically engage third-party valuation experts to assist in determining the fair values for both the identifiable tangible and intangible assets. Certain estimates and judgments are required in the application of the fair value techniques, including estimates of future cash flows, selling prices, replacement costs, royalty rates for use of assets, economic lives and the selection of a discount rate.
The Company reviews the carrying value of goodwill in accordance with accounting rules on impairment of goodwill, which require that the Company estimate the fair value of each of its reporting units annually, or when impairment indicators exist, and compare such amounts to their respective carrying values to determine if an impairment of goodwill is required. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit for the 2014, 2013 and 2012 evaluations was determined using discounted future expected cash flows (level 3 unobservable inputs) consistent with the accounting guidance for fair-value measurements. Certain estimates and judgments are required in the application of the fair value models, including, but not limited to, estimates of future cash flows and the selection of a discount rate. At December 31, 2014, the Companys reporting units for goodwill impairment evaluation purposes were the OneSubsea, Process Systems, Surface, Drilling, Valves and Measurement businesses. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2014, there were five reporting units within the V&M segment (now combined into two reporting units based on changes in managements reporting structure during the fourth quarter of 2014). Those reporting units included $311 million of goodwill. The Company performed a goodwill impairment test before and after the change in V&Ms reporting units and concluded there was no impairment.
Generally, the Company conducts its goodwill impairment review during the first quarter of each annual period. Due to the significant drop in commodity prices during the latter half of 2014 and the reorganization of the Companys reporting structure, as described above, the Company made an additional evaluation of goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2014 based upon macro factors that existed at that point in time. The fair value of our Process Systems reporting unit was estimated to be 10% to 15% higher than its carrying value as part of that evaluation. The estimated fair value for Process Systems was based on forecasted timing and success in receiving new major project awards in 2015 and beyond, the pricing and profitability of those new awards and further improvements in revenue growth and profitability rates from those achieved historically. Should our expectations prove to be incorrect due to (i) further declines in oil and gas prices and continued instability in the worldwide energy markets, (ii) unanticipated delays occurring in project awards, including unplanned project cancellations, or, (iii) an increase in interest rates, our prior estimates of future earnings, cash flows and fair value of the Process Systems business would be negatively impacted, which could lead to an impairment of goodwill for that reporting unit, possibly even as early as our annual evaluation during the first quarter of 2015. Goodwill associated with the Process Systems reporting unit at December 31, 2014 was approximately $571 million.
53 Table of Contents The Companys intangible assets, excluding goodwill, represent purchased patents, trademarks, customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets. The majority of intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the years expected to be benefited, generally ranging from 5 to 28 years. Such intangibles are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. As many areas of the Companys business rely on patents and proprietary technology, it has followed a policy of seeking patent protection both inside and outside the United States for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance. The costs of developing any intangibles internally, as well as costs of defending such intangibles, are expensed as incurred. No material impairment of intangible assets was required during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 or 2012, except as reflected in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Long-Lived Assets In accordance with accounting rules for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, such assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, to be held and used by the Company are reviewed to determine whether any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. For long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company bases its evaluation on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets, the future economic benefit of the assets, any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions or factors that may be present. If such impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, the Company determines whether an impairment has occurred through the use of an undiscounted cash flow analysis of the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. If an impairment has occurred, the Company recognizes a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Assets are classified as held for sale when the Company has a plan, approved by the appropriate levels of management, for disposal of such assets and those assets are stated at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. No material impairment of long-lived assets was required during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 or 2012.
Product Warranty Estimated warranty costs are accrued either at the time of sale based upon historical experience or, in some cases, when specific warranty problems are encountered. Adjustments to the recorded liability are made periodically to reflect actual experience.
Contingencies The Company accrues for costs relating to litigation when such liabilities become probable and reasonably estimable. Such estimates may be based on advice from third parties, amounts specified by contract, amounts designated by legal statute or managements judgment, as appropriate. Revisions to contingent liabilities are reflected in income in the period in which different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect the Companys previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss. Amounts paid upon the ultimate resolution of contingent liabilities may be materially different from previous estimates and could require adjustments to the estimated reserves to be recognized in the period such new information becomes known.
Income Taxes The asset and liability approach is used to account for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Income tax expense includes U.S. and foreign income taxes, including U.S. federal taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are planned to be remitted. Taxes are not provided on the translation component of comprehensive income since the effect of translation is not considered to modify the amount of the earnings that are planned to be remitted.
A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax asset, if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Interest related to accruals for uncertain tax positions is reflected as a component of interest expense in the Consolidated Results of Operations statement. Penalties on a tax position taken by the Company are reflected as a component of income tax expense in the Consolidated Results of Operations statement. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys income taxes.
Environmental Remediation and Compliance Environmental remediation and postremediation monitoring costs are accrued when such obligations become probable and reasonably estimable. Such future expenditures are not discounted to their present value.
54 Table of Contents Pension and Postretirement Benefits Accounting The Company recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The measurement date for all of the Companys plans was December 31, 2014. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Stock-Based Compensation At December 31, 2014, the Company had grants outstanding under various stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described in further detail in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Compensation expense for the Companys stock-based compensation plans is measured using the fair value method required by accounting rules on stock compensation. Under this guidance, the fair value of stock option grants and restricted stock unit awards is amortized to expense using the straight-line method over the shorter of the vesting period or the remaining employee service period.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments as assets and liabilities on a gross basis and measures them at fair value. Hedge accounting is only applied when the derivative is deemed highly effective at offsetting changes in anticipated cash flows of the hedged item or transaction. Changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other elements of comprehensive income (loss) until the underlying transactions are recognized in earnings, at which time any deferred hedging gains or losses are reclassified to earnings in the same income statement caption as impacted by the hedged item. Any ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative used as a cash flow hedge is recorded in earnings as incurred. The amounts recorded in earnings from ineffectiveness for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 have not been material. The Company may at times also use forward or option contracts to hedge certain other foreign currency exposures. These contracts are not designated as hedges under the accounting guidance described above. Therefore, the changes in fair value of these contracts are recognized in earnings as they occur and offset gains or losses on the related exposures.
Foreign Currency For most subsidiaries and branches outside the U.S., the local currency is the functional currency. The financial statements of these subsidiaries and branches are translated into U.S. dollars as follows: (i) assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates; (ii) income and expenses at monthly average exchange rates or exchange rates in effect on the date of the transaction; and (iii) stockholders equity at historical exchange rates. For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a component of accumulated other elements of comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
For certain other subsidiaries and branches, operations are conducted primarily in currencies other than the local currencies, which are therefore the functional currency. Non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at ending exchange rates. Revenue, expense and gain and loss accounts of these foreign subsidiaries and branches are remeasured at average exchange rates or exchange rates in effect on the date of the transaction. Non-functional currency non-monetary assets and liabilities, and the related revenue, expense, gain and loss accounts are remeasured at historical rates.
Foreign currency gains and losses arising from monetary transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in income. The effects of foreign currency transactions were a gain of $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a gain of less than $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and a loss of $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
Reclassifications and Revisions Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
Note 2: Discontinued Operations Effective June 1, 2014, the Company completed the sale of its Reciprocating Compression business to General Electric for gross cash consideration of approximately $550 million, before transaction costs.
On August 18, 2014, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Centrifugal Compression business to Ingersoll Rand for gross cash consideration of $850 million, subject to closing adjustments. The sale was completed effective January 1, 2015.

The acquisition was made to support the Companys international growth strategy by expanding its downstream industrial valve offerings. Douglas Cheros results of operations have been included in the V&M segment since the date of acquisition.
OneSubsea  On June 30, 2013, Cameron and Schlumberger Limited completed the formation of OneSubsea, a venture established to manufacture and develop products, systems and services for the subsea oil and gas market. Cameron contributed its existing subsea business unit and received $600 million from Schlumberger, while Schlumberger contributed its Framo, Surveillance, Flow Assurance and Power and Controls businesses, which included an additional $3 million of cash. As 60% owner, Cameron manages the venture and reflects a noncontrolling interest in its financial statements for Schlumbergers 40% interest in the venture.
Under the purchase method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of the Schlumberger businesses contributed to OneSubsea were reflected at their estimated fair values at June 30, 2013. The excess of the fair value of the businesses contributed by Schlumberger over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of those businesses was recorded as goodwill. The OneSubsea goodwill, totaling approximately $1 billion, is not deductible for tax purposes.
Due to Cameron maintaining control of OneSubsea, the contribution of Camerons existing subsea business unit into the venture was recorded at historical cost and the issuance of a 40% interest in the venture to Schlumberger was reflected as an adjustment to Camerons paid in capital in accordance with accounting rules governing decreases in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary without loss of control. Accordingly, the direct income tax consequences were also reflected as an adjustment to paid in capital. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company paid approximately $80 million in taxes associated with this transaction.
2012 Acquisitions  During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company spent $40 million, net of cash acquired, on two acquisitions, CairnToul Well Equipment Services Limited and ICI Artificial Lift, Inc. both of which were made to enhance the product and service offerings of its Surface segment.
On June 6, 2012, the Company closed on its purchase of the drilling equipment business of TTS Energy Division (TTS) from TTS Group ASA, a Norwegian company, for a cash payment of $248 million, net of cash acquired, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. TTS provides high performance drilling equipment, rig packages and rig solutions for both onshore and offshore rigs to the international energy industry and its financial results have been included in the Drilling segment since the date of acquisition.
During the first quarter of 2012, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Elco Filtration and Testing, Inc. (Elco), for a total purchase price of $61 million, net of cash acquired. Elco was purchased to strengthen the Companys wellhead product and service offerings and has been included in the Surface segment since the date of acquisition.
Approximately $250 million of goodwill was recorded as a result of the 2012 acquisitions, nearly $28 million of which is deductible for tax purposes.

The defined benefit pension plan covering employees in the United Kingdom was frozen to new entrants effective June 14, 1996.
Certain of the Companys employees also participate in various employee welfare benefit plans, including medical, dental and prescriptions. Additionally, certain retirees based in the United States receive retiree medical, prescription and life insurance benefits. All of the welfare benefit plans, including those providing postretirement benefits, are unfunded.
During 2014, the Company communicated to employees and beneficiaries of three of its international retirement plans that it had elected to terminate the respective defined benefit plans and replace them with defined contribution plans. The final settlement payments will occur in early 2015. The Company recorded a net pre-tax curtailment gain of approximately $8 million (included in Other Costs  see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) related to the termination of these plans.

For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the investment strategy has been designed to approximate the performance of market indexes. The Companys targeted allocation for the U.K. plan for 2015 and beyond is approximately 55% in equities, 40% in fixed income debt securities and 5% in real estate and other.
During 2014, the Company made contributions totaling approximately $27 million to the assets of its various defined benefit pension plans. Contributions to plan assets for 2015 are currently expected to approximate $12 million assuming no change in the current discount rate or expected investment earnings.
The assets of the Companys pension plans are generally invested in debt and equity securities or mutual funds, which are valued based on quoted market prices for an individual asset (level 1 market inputs) or mutual fund unit values, which are based on the fair values of the individual securities that the fund has invested in (level 2 observable market inputs). A certain portion of the assets are invested in insurance contracts, real estate and other investments, which are valued based on level 3 unobservable inputs.

The assumptions for expected long-term rates of return on assets are based on historical experience and estimated future investment returns, taking into consideration anticipated asset allocations, investment strategies and the views of various investment professionals.
The rate of compensation increase assumption for international plans reflects local economic conditions and the Companys compensation strategy in those locations.
The health care cost trend rate is assumed to decrease gradually from 7% to 5% by 2021 and remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate would not have a material impact on the service and interest cost components in 2014 or the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2014.
Amounts applicable to the Companys pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets and accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were as follows: Projected Benefit Obligation in Excess of Plan Assets Accumulated Benefit Obligation in Excess of Plan Assets at December 31, at December 31, ( dollars in millions ) 2014 2013 2014 2013 Fair value of applicable plan assets $ 455 $ 97 $ 455 $ 42 Projected benefit obligation of applicable plans $ 509 $ 172   Accumulated benefit obligation of applicable plans   $ 469 $ 84 64 Table of Contents Future expected benefit payments are as follows: ( dollars in millions ) Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits Year ending December 31 : 2015 $ 68 $ 1 2016 $ 12 $ 1 2017 $ 12 $ 1 2018 $ 13 $ 1 2019 $ 14 $ 1 2020 - 2024 $ 74 $ 3 The Companys United States-based employees who are not covered by a bargaining unit and certain others are also eligible to participate in the Cameron International Corporation Retirement Savings Plan. Under this plan, employees savings deferrals are partially matched in cash and invested at the employees discretion. The Company provides nondiscretionary retirement contributions to the Retirement Savings Plan on behalf of each eligible employee equal to 3% of their defined pay. Eligible employees vest in the 3% retirement contributions plus any earnings after completing three years of service. In addition, the Company provides an immediately vested matching contribution of up to 100% of the first 6% of pay contributed by each eligible employee. Employees may contribute amounts in excess of 6% of their pay to the Retirement Savings Plan, subject to certain United States Internal Revenue Service limitations. The Companys expense for the matching and retirement contribution for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 amounted to $77 million, $77 million and $70 million, respectively. In addition, the Company provides savings or other benefit plans for employees under collective bargaining agreements and, in the case of certain international employees, as required by government mandate, which provide for, among other things, Company funding in cash based on specified formulas. Expense with respect to these various defined contribution and government-mandated plans for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 amounted to $73 million, $83 million and $60 million, respectively.
Note 10: Stock-Based Compensation Plans The Company has grants outstanding under various equity compensation plans, only one of which, the Equity Incentive Plan (EQIP), is currently available for future grants of equity compensation awards to employees and non-employee directors. Options granted under the Companys equity compensation plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and all terms were fixed.
Stock-based compensation expense recognized was as follows: Year Ended December 31, ( dollars in millions ) 2014 2013 2012 Outstanding restricted and deferred stock units and awards $ 44 $ 40 $ 32 Unvested outstanding stock options 10 14 12 Total stock-based compensation expense $ 54 $ 54 $ 44 The total income statement tax benefit recognized from stock-based compensation arrangements during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 totaled approximately $20 million, $20 million and $17 million, respectively.
Stock options Options with terms of seven or ten years have been granted to officers and other key employees of the Company under the EQIP plan at a fixed exercise price equal to the fair value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. The options generally vest in one-third increments each year on the anniversary date following the date of grant, based on continued employment.
65 Table of Contents A summary of option activity under the Companys stock compensation plans as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 is presented below: Options Shares Weighted- Average Exercise Price Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (dollars in millions) Outstanding at January 1, 2014 4,197,093 $ 47.92 Granted 782,779 57.71 Exercised (1,064,138 ) 40.48 Forfeited (3,246 ) 64.97 Outstanding at December 31, 2014 3,912,488 $ 51.89 6.27 $ 13 Vested at December 31, 2014 or expected to vest in the future 3,899,272 $ 51.86 6.26 $ 13 Exercisable at December 31, 2014 2,471,452 $ 47.32 4.63 $ 13 At December 31, 2014 Stock-based compensation cost not yet recognized under the straight-line method ( dollars in millions ) $ 14 Weighted-average remaining expense recognition period (in years ) 1.95 The fair values per share of option grants for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula with the following weighted-average assumptions: Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Expected life ( in years ) 3.3 3.2 3.2 Risk-free interest rate 0.86 % 0.67 % 0.37 % Volatility 33.8 % 34.3 % 39.4 % Expected dividend yield 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % The Company determined the assumptions involving the expected life of its options and volatility rates based primarily on historical data and consideration of expectations for the future.
The above assumptions and market prices of the Companys common stock at the date of option exercises resulted in the following values: Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Grant-date fair value per option $ 14.51 $ 16.19 $ 15.68 Intrinsic value of options exercised ( dollars in millions ) $ 26 $ 31 $ 34 Average intrinsic value per share of options exercised $ 24.17 $ 26.30 $ 23.39 66 Table of Contents Restricted and deferred stock units and awards Grants of restricted stock units are made to officers and other key employees. The restricted stock units granted generally provide for vesting in one-third increments each year or three-year 100% cliff vesting on the third anniversary of the date of grant, based on continued employment.
Non-employee directors are entitled to receive an annual number of deferred stock units equal to a value of $250,000 determined on the day following the Companys annual meeting of stockholders or, if a directors election to the Board occurs between annual meetings of stockholders, the initial grant of deferred stock units is based on a pro-rata portion of the annual grant amount equal to the remaining number of months in the board year until the next annual meeting of stockholders. These units, which have no exercise price and no expiration date, vest in one-fourth increments quarterly over the following year but cannot be converted into common stock until the earlier of termination of Board service or three years, although Board members have the ability to voluntarily defer conversion for a longer period of time.

All of the Companys senior notes rank equally with the Companys other existing unsecured and unsubordinated debt.
Utilizing proceeds from these notes, on July 21, 2014, the Company paid approximately $253 million, which included a make-whole premium plus accrued interest, to redeem early its $250 million principal amount of 1.6% Senior Notes.
During the first quarter of 2014, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the establishment of a $500 million commercial paper program. This program allows for issuances of commercial paper with maturities of up to 364 days to be used for general corporate purposes. The average term of the outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2014 was approximately 36 days.
Multicurrency Revolving Letter of Credit and Credit Facilities The Companys Credit Agreement dated April 14, 2008 (as amended and restated, the "Amended Credit Agreement") provides for a multi-currency borrowing capacity of $835 million and matures on June 6, 2016. Pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement, Cameron may borrow funds at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread, which varies based on the Companys current debt rating, and, if aggregate outstanding credit exposure exceeds one-half of the total facility amount, an additional fee will be incurred. At December 31, 2014, no amounts have been borrowed under the $835 million Amended Credit Agreement.
68 Table of Contents On April 11, 2014, the Company entered into a new $750 million three-year multi-currency syndicated Revolving Credit Facility expiring April 11, 2017. Up to $200 million of this new facility may be used for letters of credit and $92 million of letters of credit issued and outstanding under a previously existing $170 million bi-lateral facility were transferred to the new Revolving Credit Facility at close and concurrently the $170 million bi-lateral facility was amended to reduce its capacity to $40 million. The new Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants and terms consistent with the Companys existing $835 million five-year multi-currency Revolving Credit Facility, described above, and it serves as the primary backstop to the commercial paper program. The Company has issued letters of credit totaling $69 million under the new $750 million Revolving Credit Facility and $3 million under the $40 million bi-lateral facility, leaving $681 million and $37 million, respectively, available for future use at December 31, 2014.
Other Other debt, some of which is held by entities located in countries with high rates of inflation, has a weighted-average interest rate of 6.5% at December 31, 2014 (6.1% at December 31, 2013).

In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
Tax attribute carryforwards which are available for use on future income tax returns at December 31, 2014 are as follows: ( dollars in millions ) Domestic Foreign Expiration Net operating losses - regular income tax $  $ 381 2018 - Indefinite Net operating losses  state income tax $ 6 $  2018  2034 Foreign tax credits $ 93 $  2016  2024 The tax benefit that the Company receives with respect to certain stock compensation plan transactions is credited to capital in excess of par value and does not reduce income tax expense.

The Company considers all unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, except certain amounts primarily earned before 2003, certain amounts earned during 2009, certain amounts earned by NATCO, and amounts previously subjected to tax in the U.S., to be permanently reinvested. An estimate of the amounts considered permanently reinvested is $5.1 billion. It is not practical for the Company to compute the amount of additional U.S. tax that would be due on this amount. The Company has provided deferred income taxes on the earnings that the Company anticipates will be remitted.
The Company operates in jurisdictions, primarily Singapore and Malaysia, in which it has been granted tax holidays. The benefit of these holidays for 2014, 2013 and 2012 was approximately $11 million, $3 million and $2 million, respectively.
Note 14: Stockholders Equity Common Stock The Companys Board of Directors has given management the authority to purchase approximately $3.8 billion of the Companys common stock.

Historical information by segment for 2012 and 2013 has been retrospectively revised to conform to the 2014 presentation.
The Subsea segment includes the operations of OneSubsea, a business jointly owned by Cameron (60%) and Schlumberger (40%). The Subsea segment delivers integrated solutions, products, systems and services to the subsea oil and gas market, including integrated subsea production systems involving wellheads, subsea trees, manifolds and flowline connectors, subsea processing systems for the enhanced recovery of hydrocarbons, control systems, connectors and services designed to maximize reservoir recovery and extend the life of each field.
The Surface segment provides onshore and offshore platform wellhead systems and processing solutions, including valves, chokes, actuators, Christmas trees and aftermarket services to oil and gas operators. Rental equipment and artificial lift technologies are also provided, as well as products and services involving shale gas production.
One of the major services provided by the Surface segment is CAMSHALE Production Solutions, which specializes in shale gas production. In this process, intense pressure from fracing fluid (usually a mixture of water and sand) is used to crack surrounding shale. Once the fractures are made, the water is removed from the well bore and the sand is left behind to hold the fractures open. Oil and natural gas then moves out of the fractures, into the well bore, and up to the surface.
The Drilling segment provides drilling equipment and aftermarket services to shipyards, drilling contractors, exploration & production operators and rental tool companies. Products fall into two broad categories: pressure control equipment and rotary drilling equipment and are designed for either onshore or offshore applications. Such products include drilling equipment packages, blowout preventers (BOPs), BOP control systems, connectors, riser systems, valve and choke manifold systems, topdrives, mud pumps, pipe handling equipment, rig designs and rig kits.
The V&M segment businesses serve portions of the upstream, midstream and downstream markets. These businesses provide valves and measurement systems that are primarily used to control, direct and measure the flow of oil and gas as they are moved from individual wellheads through flow lines, gathering lines and transmission systems to refineries, petrochemical plants and industrial centers for processing. Products include gate valves, butterfly valves, Orbit brand rising stem ball valves, double block and bleed valves, plug valves, globe valves, check valves, actuators, chokes and aftermarket parts and services as well as measurement equipment products such as totalizers, turbine meters, flow computers, chart recorders, ultrasonic flow meters and sampling systems.
The Companys primary customers are oil and gas majors, national oil companies, independent producers, engineering and construction companies, drilling contractors, rental companies, geothermal energy and independent power producers, pipeline operators, major chemical, petrochemical and refining companies, natural gas processing and transmission companies, compression leasing companies, durable goods manufacturers, utilities and air separation companies.
The Company markets its equipment through a worldwide network of sales and marketing employees supported by agents and distributors in selected international locations. Due to the extremely technical nature of many of the products, the marketing effort is further supported by a staff of engineering employees.
The Company expenses all research and product development and enhancement costs as incurred, or if incurred in connection with a product ordered by a customer, when the revenue associated with the product is recognized. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, research and product development expenditures, including amounts incurred on projects designed to enhance or add to its existing product offerings, totaled approximately $128 million, $83 million and $63 million, respectively. The Subsea segment accounted for 58%, 44% and 47% of each respective years total costs.

The Company was also liable to these financial institutions for financial letters of credit and other guarantees issued on its behalf totaling nearly $52 million, which provide security to third parties relating to the Companys ability to meet specified financial obligations, including payment of leases, customs duties, insurance and other matters. Additionally, the Company was liable for approximately $28 million of insurance bonds at December 31, 2014 relating to the requirements in certain foreign jurisdictions where the Company does business that the Company hold insurance bonds rather than bank guarantees.
The Companys other off-balance sheet risks were not material at December 31, 2014.
Concentrations of Credit Risk and Major Customers Apart from its normal exposure to its customers, who are predominantly in the energy industry, the Company had no significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2014. The Company typically does not require collateral for its customer trade receivables but does often obtain letters of credit from third-party banks as security for future payment on certain large product shipments. Allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded for estimated losses that may result from the inability of customers to make required payments. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade receivables, trade payables, derivative instruments and debt instruments. The book values of trade receivables, trade payables and floating-rate debt instruments are considered to be representative of their respective fair values.
78 Table of Contents Following is a summary of the Companys financial instruments which have been valued at fair value in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2014 and 2013: Fair Value Based on Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Fair Value Based on Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Total ( dollars in millions ) 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 Cash and cash equivalents : Cash $ 616 $ 618 $  $  $ 616 $ 618 Money market funds 842 1,172   842 1,172 Commercial paper   13 4 13 4 U.S. treasury securities 5    5  U.S. corporate obligations 4    4  Non-U.S. bank and other obligations 33 19   33 19 Short-term investments : Commercial paper   11  11  U.S. Treasury securities 51 41   51 41 U.S. corporate obligations 51    51  Non-qualified plan assets : Money market funds 1 1   1 1 Domestic bond funds 3 3   3 3 Domestic equity funds 5 5   5 5 International equity funds 3 3   3 3 Blended equity funds 5 4   5 4 Common stock 2 2   2 2 Derivatives, net asset (liability) : Foreign currency contracts   (99 ) 19 (99 ) 19 Total financial instruments $ 1,621 $ 1,868 $ (75 ) $ 23 $ 1,546 $ 1,891 Fair values for financial instruments utilizing level 2 inputs were determined from information obtained from third-party pricing sources, broker quotes, calculations involving the use of market indices or mutual fund unit values determined based upon the valuation of the funds underlying assets.
At December 31, 2014, the fair value of the Companys fixed-rate debt (based on Level 1 quoted market rates) was approximately $2.9 billion as compared to the $2.7 billion face value of the debt recorded, net of original issue discounts, in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2013, the fair value of the Companys fixed-rate debt (based on Level 1 quoted market rates) was approximately $2.7 billion as compared to the $2.5 billion face value of the debt.
Derivative Contracts In order to mitigate the effect of exchange rate changes, the Company will often attempt to structure sales contracts to provide for collections from customers in the currency in which the Company incurs its manufacturing costs. In certain instances, the Company will enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge specific large anticipated receipts or disbursements in currencies for which the Company does not have fully offsetting local currency expenditures or receipts. The Company was party to a number of long-term foreign currency forward contracts at December 31, 2014. The purpose of the majority of these contracts was to hedge large anticipated non-functional currency cash flows on major subsea, drilling, valve or other equipment contracts. Many of these contracts have been designated as and are accounted for as cash flow hedges with changes in the fair value of those contracts recorded in accumulated other elements of comprehensive income (loss) in the period such change occurs. Certain other contracts, many of which are centrally managed, are intended to offset other foreign currency exposures but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes and, therefore, any change in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in earnings in the period such change occurs. The Company determines the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency forward contracts based on quoted exchange rates for the respective currencies applicable to similar instruments.
79 Table of Contents Total gross volume bought (sold) by notional currency and maturity date on open foreign currency forward contracts at December 31, 2014 was as follows: Notional Amount - Buy Notional Amount - Sell ( in millions ) 2015 2016 2017 Total 2015 2016 Total Foreign exchange forward contracts - Notional currency in : Euro 200 14  214 (10 ) (1 ) (11 ) Malaysian ringgit 377 51  428 (29 )  (29 ) Norwegian krone 895 117 4 1,016 (96 ) (44 ) (140 ) Pound Sterling 110 5  115 (22 ) (1 ) (23 ) U.S. dollar 60   60 (635 ) (47 ) (682 ) Foreign exchange option contracts - Notional currency in : U.S. dollar 87   87    While the Company and its counterparties have the right to offset gains and losses on different derivative contracts under certain circumstances, the Companys policy is to record its derivative contracts on a gross basis. The fair values of derivative financial instruments recorded in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows: December 31, 2014 2013 ( dollars in millions ) Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Derivatives designated as hedges : Foreign exchange contracts  Current $ 8 $ 83 $ 28 $ 10 Non-current 1 12 3 2 Total derivatives designated as hedges 9 95 31 12 Derivatives not designated as hedges : Foreign exchange contracts  Current 1 14 6 6 Non-current     Total derivatives not designated as hedges 1 14 6 6 Total derivatives $ 10 $ 109 $ 37 $ 18 The after-tax loss on cash flow hedges included in accumulated other elements of comprehensive income and in noncontrolling interests totaled $47 million at December 31, 2014. Approximately $38 million (after-tax) is expected to be recognized as a reduction in earnings in 2015.
80 Table of Contents The amount of pre-tax gain (loss) from the ineffective portion of derivatives designated as hedging instruments and from derivatives not designated as hedging instruments was: Year Ended December 31, ( dollars in millions ) 2014 2013 2012 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments : Foreign currency contracts  Cost of sales $ (7 ) $ 1 $  Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments : Foreign currency contracts  Cost of sales (11 ) 7 2 Other costs (8 ) (1 ) 16 Total pre-tax gain (loss) $ (26 ) $ 7 $ 18 Note 20: Contingencies The Company is subject to a number of contingencies, including litigation, tax contingencies and environmental matters.
Litigation The Company has been and continues to be named as a defendant in a number of multi-defendant, multi-plaintiff tort lawsuits. At December 31, 2014, the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet included a liability of approximately $17 million for such cases. The Company believes, based on its review of the facts and law, that the potential exposure from these suits will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
Tax and Other Contingencies The Company has legal entities in over 50 countries. As a result, the Company is subject to various tax filing requirements in these countries. The Company prepares its tax filings in a manner which it believes is consistent with such filing requirements. However, some of the tax laws and regulations to which the Company is subject require interpretation and/or judgment. Although the Company believes the tax liabilities for periods ending on or before the balance sheet date have been adequately provided for in the financial statements, to the extent a taxing authority believes the Company has not prepared its tax filings in accordance with the authoritys interpretation of the tax laws and regulations, the Company could be exposed to additional taxes.
The Company has been assessed customs duties and penalties by the government of Brazil totaling almost $50 million at December 31, 2014, including interest accrued at local country rates, following a customs audit for the years 2003-2010. The Company filed an administrative appeal and believes a majority of this assessment will ultimately be proven to be incorrect because of numerous errors in the assessment, and because the government has not provided appropriate supporting documentation for the assessment. As a result, the Company currently expects no material adverse impact on its results of operations or cash flows as a result of the ultimate resolution of this matter. No amounts have been accrued for this assessment as of December 31, 2014 as no loss is currently considered probable.
Environmental Matters The Company is currently identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) for one site designated for cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) or similar state law. The Osborne site is a landfill into which a predecessor of the Reciprocating Compression operation in Grove City, Pennsylvania deposited waste, where remediation was completed in 2011 and remaining costs relate to ongoing ground water monitoring. The Company is also a party with de minimis exposure at other CERCLA sites.
81 Table of Contents The Company is engaged in site cleanup under the Voluntary Cleanup Plan of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality ("TCEQ") at a former manufacturing location in Houston, Texas and had been engaged in one at aformer manufacturing location in Missouri City, Texas. With respect to the Missouri City site, the Companyreceived a Certificate of Completion fromthe TCEQ on February 17, 2015. With respect to the Houston site, in 2001, the Company discovered that contaminated underground water had migrated under an adjacent residential area. Pursuant to applicable state regulations, the Company notified the affected homeowners. Concerns over the impact on property values of the underground water contamination and its public disclosure led to a number of claims by homeowners. The Company has settled these claims, primarily as a result of the settlement of a class action lawsuit, and is obligated to reimburse approximately 190 homeowners for any diminution in value of their property due to contamination concerns at the time of the property's sale. Test results of monitoring wells on the southeastern border of the plume indicate that the plume is moving in a new direction, likely as a result of a ground water drainage system completed as part of an interstate highway improvement project. As a result, the Company notified 39 additional homeowners, and may provide notice to additional homeowners, whose property is adjacent to the class area that their property may be affected. The Company continues to monitor the situation to determine whether additional remedial measures would be appropriate. The Company believes, based on its review of the facts and law, that any potential exposure from existing agreements as well as any possible new claims that may be filed with respect to this underground water contamination will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. The Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet included a noncurrent liability of approximately $7 million for these matters as of December 31, 2014.
Additionally, the Company has discontinued operations at a number of other sites which had been active for many years and which may have yet undiscovered contamination. The Company does not believe, based upon information currently available, that there are any material environmental liabilities existing at these locations. At December 31, 2014, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet included a noncurrent liability of nearly $3 million for these environmental matters.
Note 21: Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) jointly issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
The core principle of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. Companies will need to:  identify performance obligations in each contract,  estimate the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price, and  allocate the transaction price to each separate performance obligation.
ASU 2014-09 will be effective for Cameron no earlier than the first quarter of 2017. The Company is beginning the process of evaluating the impact of the new standard on its business and addressing whether it will select either the full retrospective or the modified retrospective implementation method upon adoption in 2017.
