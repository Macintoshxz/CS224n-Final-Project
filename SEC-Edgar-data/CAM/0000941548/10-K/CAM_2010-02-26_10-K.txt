BUSINESS Cameron International Corporation (Cameron or the Company) is a leading provider of flow equipment products, systems and services to worldwide oil, gas and process industries.See Glossary of Terms at the end of Item 1 for definitions of certain terms used in this section. Any reference to Cameron, its divisions or business units within this paragraph or elsewhere within this Form 10-K as being a leader, leading provider, leading manufacturer, or having a leading position is based on the amount of equipment installed worldwide and available industry data.
The Companys operations are organized into three business segments  Drilling & Production Systems (DPS), Valves & Measurement (V&M) and Compression Systems (CS).For additional business segment information for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which Notes are incorporated herein by reference in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Camerons origin dates back to the mid-1800s with the manufacture of steam engines that provided power for plants and textile or rolling mills. By 1900, with the discovery of oil and gas, Camerons predecessors moved into the production of internal combustion engines and gas compressors. Product offerings were added by the Companys predecessors through various acquisitions, in particular the acquisitions of The Bessemer Gas Engine Company (gas engines and compressors); Pennsylvania Pump and Compressor (reciprocating air and gas compressors); Ajax Iron Works (compressors); Superior (engines and compressors); Joy Petroleum Equipment Group (valves, couplings and wellheads); Joy Industrial Compressor Group (compressors); and Cameron Iron Works (blowout preventers, ball valves, control equipment and McEvoy-Willis wellhead equipment and choke valves).
Cameron, a Delaware corporation, was incorporated on November 10, 1994. The Company operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cooper Industries, Inc. until June 30, 1995, the effective date of the completion of an exchange offer with Cooper Industries stockholders resulting in the Company becoming a separate stand-alone company. The common stock of Cameron trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CAM. The Companys Internet address is www.c-a-m.com . General information about Cameron, including its Corporate Governance Principles, charters for the committees of the Companys board of directors, Standards of Conduct, and Codes of Ethics for Management Personnel, including Senior Financial Officers and Directors, can be found in the Ethics and Governance section of the Companys website. The Company makes available, free of charge, on its website its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files or furnishes them to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). Information filed by the Company with the SEC is also available at www.sec.gov or may be read and copied at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549.Information regarding operations of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.

3 Table of Contents Business Segments Markets and Products Drilling & Production Systems Segment DPS is one of the worlds leading providers of systems and equipment used to control pressures, direct flows of oil and gas wells and separate oil and gas from impurities. Its products are employed in a wide variety of operating environments including basic onshore fields, highly complex onshore and offshore environments, deepwater subsea applications and ultra-high temperature geothermal operations.
DPSs products include surface and subsea production systems, blowout preventers (BOPs), drilling and production control systems, oil and gas separation equipment, gate valves, actuators, chokes, wellheads, drilling riser and aftermarket parts and services. DPSs products are marketed under the brand names CAMERON, W-K-M, MCEVOY and WILLIS. Additionally, DPS manufactures elastomers, which are used in pressure and flow control equipment and other petroleum industry applications, as well as in the petroleum, petrochemical, rubber molding and plastics industries.
DPS is one of the leading global suppliers of integrated drilling systems for land, offshore, platform and subsea applications. Drilling equipment designed and manufactured by DPS includes ram and annular BOPs, drilling riser, drilling valves, choke and kill manifolds, surface and subsea BOP control systems, multiplexed electro-hydraulic (MUX) control systems and diverter systems. DPS also provides services under CAMCHEC, an inspection system that allows drilling contractors to inspect drilling riser on their rigs offline, saving time and money on maintenance and unnecessary transportation.
Although the pace of orders for new deepwater drilling rigs moderated in 2008 and 2007 from the record levels of 2006, as did orders for jackups and land rigs, DPS still had the second largest bookings year for its drilling business in 2008.The Company believes it maintained its traditional market share during 2008 and continues to be a primary supplier of BOPs and related equipment to the drilling industry.As a result of the high order levels during the last three years, the Company has made significant investments at the Beziers, France BOP and riser manufacturing facility, the Houston Controls facility and the Berwick, Louisiana BOP stack-up yard. The Company also opened a new 48,000-square foot aftermarket facility in Houston during 2007 to provide a full range of machining, welding and testing capabilities.The Company has also taken steps to expand its product offerings and services to drilling customers with the November 2008 purchase of KB Industries, an Odessa, Texas-based manufacturer of surface BOPs and control systems and the September 2008 acquisition of Guiberson Well Service Systems, a market leader in well servicing equipment and replacement parts.
DPS is also a global market leader in supplying surface production equipment, from conventional to high-pressure, high temperature (HPHT) wellheads, API Christmas trees and chokes used on land or installed on offshore platforms.
The surface business, which has a global base of installed equipment and an aftermarket presence in virtually every major hydrocarbon-producing region around the world was the second largest revenue contributor to the DPS segment in 2008.This business saw increased order levels in 2008 primarily from customers in the United States, as well as those in the Asia Pacific region.The Company is nearing completion of a new facility in Ploiesti, Romania, which is expected to become fully functional in the third quarter of 2009, in order to further expand its offerings to customers in the European, North African and Russian markets. Also, additional facilities are under construction in Kazakhstan and in Azerbaijan to address expected demand for surface products in the Caspian Sea region and North Africa.The Company has also continued to make investments in its artificial lift business during 2008 with the acquisition of SBS Oilfield Equipment GmbH, an Austrian-based manufacturer of in-well rod lift pumping and progressive cavity pumping systems, and the late December 2008 acquisition of Paramount Pumps and Supplies, Inc., a Kansas-based manufacturer of rod lift pumping systems.
DPS continues to be a leading provider of subsea wellheads, Christmas trees, manifolds and production controls to customers worldwide, from basic tree orders to integrated solutions that require systems engineering and project management as well as installation and aftermarket support. DPSs Subsea Systems organization, created in 2005, has global responsibility for research and development, engineering, sales, manufacturing, installation and aftermarket support for subsea products and systems, and provides customers with integrated solutions to subsea field development requirements under engineering, procurement and construction contracts.This business accounted for the DPS segments largest source of revenue in 2008.
4 Table of Contents Awards received for subsea equipment during 2008 were the largest in the Companys history and included equipment ordered for use on two of the largest projects in the industrys history.In order to address capacity needs from the record high order levels, improve efficiency and lower manufacturing costs in the subsea product line, the Company completed a new state-of-the-art subsea manufacturing, assembly and test plant in Johor, Malaysia in 2007.The plant, which became fully operational in 2008, is currently being expanded, with completion expected in early 2010.In addition, the Company made various capital investments in its Leeds, England and Berwick, Louisiana facilities during 2008 and, in order to accommodate increased and expected future project business in the Brazilian markets, in its Taubate, Brazil manufacturing facility in 2007.
As petroleum exploration activities have increasingly focused on subsea locations, DPS has directed much of its new product development efforts toward this market. DPSs patented SpoolTree horizontal subsea production system, which was introduced in 1993, is used in oil and gas fields with subsea completions that require frequent retrieval of downhole equipment. With the SpoolTree system, well completion and workover activities can be performed without a workover riser or removal of the Christmas tree and under conventional blowout preventer control, thereby reducing the time, equipment and expense needed to perform such activities.
DPS advanced its tradition of innovation with the introduction in 2004 of an all-electric, direct current powered subsea production system, CameronDC, which is designed to offer greater reliability and provide substantial cost savings to customers.Following intensive testing and review, the first commercial deployment of the CameronDC system took place in late 2008 in the Dutch North Sea.In March 2007, Cameron acquired DES Operations Limited, an Aberdeen, Scotland-based supplier of production enhancement technology, and developer of the unique Multiple Application Re-injection System (MARS), which enables the installation of multiple processing technologies directly onto a subsea completion without disrupting existing flowlines or infrastructure.
DPSs Flow Control group was formed to focus resources on the choke product line with the goal of enhancing DPSs performance in this product line. Flow Control manufactures Cameron and Willis brand chokes and Cameron brand actuators for the surface and subsea production and drilling markets as well as drilling choke control panels and surface wellhead safety systems. The Companys primary choke manufacturing operations are located in Longford, Ireland, and its primary surface gate valve actuator manufacturing operations are located in Houston, Texas.
During 2008, Flow Control added to its product offerings with the acquisition of the Surface Safety Systems business that had previously been part of the Baker Hughes International Oil Tools division and the acquisition of Dyna-Torque, Inc., a Michigan-based manufacturer of gear operators that can be combined with the segments existing actuator products for use on valves around the world.In 2006, the Flow Control product line was expanded with the addition of the LEDEEN quarter-turn actuator line, acquired as part of the Dresser On/Off Valve business unit acquisition in late 2005. This product line is manufactured at the Companys facility in Voghera, Italy. Also, during 2006, the surface choke product line was expanded as Flow Control began producing AOP brand surface chokes in its Houston, Texas facility.These initiatives, along with the introduction of a new generation compact subsea choke, all contributed to order and revenue gains in 2008 and 2007 for the Flow Control business.

Market Issues Cameron is one of the leaders in the global market for the supply of petroleum production equipment. Cameron believes that it is well-positioned to serve these markets. Plant and service center facilities around the world in major oil- and gas-producing regions provide a broad market coverage. Information relating to revenues generated from shipments to various geographic regions of the world is set forth on page25 of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Cameron International Corporation incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference.
The market beyond North America continues to be of greater importance to Cameron.This was particularly evident as revenues generated from shipments to customers outside of North America climbed from 63% of the Companys revenues in 2007 to 65% of the Companys revenues in 2008.The desire to expand oil and gas resources and transmission capacity in developed and developing countries, for both economic and political reasons, continues to be a major factor affecting market demand. Additionally, establishment of industrial infrastructure in the developing countries will necessitate the growth of basic industries that require plant air and process compression equipment. Production and service facilities in North and South America, Europe, the Far and Middle East and West Africa provide the Company with the ability to serve the global marketplace.
7 Table of Contents In recent years, DPS has been expanding into the deepwater subsea systems market. This market is significantly different from the Companys other markets since deepwater subsea systems projects are significantly larger in scope and complexity, in terms of both technical and logistical requirements. Subsea projects (i) typically involve long lead times, (ii) typically are larger in financial scope, (iii) typically require substantial engineering resources to meet the technical requirements of the project and (iv) often involve the application of existing technology to new environments and in some cases, the application of new technology. These projects accounted for approximately 13% of the Companys consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008. To the extent the Company experiences difficulties in meeting the technical and/or delivery requirements of the projects, the Companys earnings or liquidity could be negatively impacted. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had a subsea systems project backlog of approximately $2.1 billion.
During 2008, the public and private credit markets in the United States and around the world became severely constricted due to economic concerns regarding past mortgage and other lending practices, current housing values and the present state of various world economies.Certain world economies have shown negative growth in recent quarters or are anticipating negative growth during some or all of 2009.In addition, oil prices, which averaged nearly $100 per barrel during 2008, declined from over $140 per barrel in mid-2008 to nearly $40 per barrel by the end of 2008.Natural gas prices averaged around $9.00 per Mcf for 2008 but had fallen to $5.00 - $6.00 per Mcf by the end of 2008.U.S. rig count also fell from more than 2,000 rigs in September 2008 to around 1,600 near the end of December 2008.All of these factors and others have contributed to an expectation of a decline in spending by many of the Companys customers during 2009, which is expected to have a negative impact on the Companys 2009 expected revenues and profitability.For additional information, see the Companys Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Cameron International Corporation incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference.
Also, see Part I, Item 1A for a discussion of other risk factors, some of which are market related, that could affect the Companys financial condition and future results.
New Product Development Cameron introduced several drilling products during the last several years. These products include the 3.5 million-pound load capacity LoadKing riser system, used for drilling in up to 10,000-foot water depths; a lightweight and lower-cost locking mechanism for subsea BOPs; a new generation of variable-bore ram packers; a Freestanding Drilling Riser, and an Environmental Safe Guard system.
Other Cameron-developed products include the patented SpoolTree  subsea production system; the CAMTROL system that includes all of Camerons controls capabilities of production, drilling and workover; the EVO  blowout preventer, introduced in 2007, which is a compact, lighter version of Camerons traditional subsea BOP and is offered with a unique patent-pending locking system; and the CameronDC subsea production system, which is the worlds first all-electric direct current-powered subsea production system, designed for increased reliability and improved performance in deepwater applications.Initial deployment of the CameronDC subsea production system occurred in late 2008.Also, during 2008, the Company introduced the Sea Pressure Accumulator  (SPA), a complement to the EVO BOP, which uses seawater pressure instead of traditional nitrogen-charged accumulator bottles to power the BOP rams.Cameron also entered into a joint agreement with Alcoa Oil and Gas in late 2008 to develop lighter weight drilling riser systems with high aluminum content.
During 2005, Cameron introduced a new subsea controls system that combines the traditional subsea control module and the subsea accumulator module in a single package, allowing for more efficient operation of the subsea tree and manifold valves. Additionally, a new state-of-the-art subsea test chamber in Camerons controls engineering facility in Celle, Germany facilitates testing of the Companys control system.
Also in 2005, Cameron launched its updated CAMTROL subsea control module, which includes new electronics, lower power demand, a DC power option and fiber optic communications to further increase reliability and enable extended offset developments and high-bandwidth intelligent completions.
Cameron has also formed a joint venture with Curtiss-Wright EMD, to combine Curtiss-Wrights motor and pump expertise with Camerons subsea technologies to develop integrated subsea multiphase pumping systems.As a result of this joint venture, as well as the separation technology available through Petreco, the Company was able to introduce in 2007 CAMFORCE , a collection of subsea processing products and services designed to enhance production from deepwater fields.
8 Table of Contents In 2006, Subsea Systems and Petreco designed their two-phase and three-phase subsea separation systems through a joint technology team originally formed in 2005.
During 2005, DPSs Flow Control group introduced a new three-inch underbalanced drilling choke, the DR30, in response to drilling customers increasing demand for higher-capacity chokes for use in underbalanced drilling applications.During 2007, Flow Control also introduced a new subsea chemical injection metering valve as well as a multi-stage control choke with the SILENCER  trim which is designed to address noise and velocity control issues in high pressure drop and surge control applications.
Over the past few years, CS has focused its product development resources to further expand its high-efficiency plant air compressor line and to provide engineered compressors matched to the requirements of its customers. The latter is being achieved by advances in aerodynamic and rotor dynamic analytical design capability and the addition of centrifugal gas applications.A major part of this effort in 2008 was the development of a new compressor selection program for the CS sales organization in order to reduce client response time and better support client budgetary requests.
During 2007, the Company also reentered the separable engine market by reintroducing two models of Superior-brand legacy engines, designed to be packaged with Camerons Superior separable compressors.Reducing the emissions footprint of our legacy engines was a key area of development focus.The Clean Burn  IV engine control system supports production of new Superior SGTD engines and uses Camerons proprietary emissions technology.The new C-Force  compressor was created through the addition of new tandem cylinders to a small Superior reciprocating frame, providing an offering ideally suited to compressed natural gas applications.
During 2008, diversification efforts looked at how the CS development organization could adapt its existing product lines in order to support adjacent market opportunities such as fuel gas boosting, landfill gas and API applications.The Turbo-Air  2040G compressor was an example of this success.

The principal competitive factors in the petroleum production equipment markets are technology, quality, service and price. Cameron believes several factors give it a strong competitive position in these markets. Most significant are Camerons broad product offering, its worldwide presence and reputation, its service and repair capabilities, its expertise in high-pressure technology and its experience in alliance and partnership arrangements with customers and other suppliers.
Cameron also has a strong position in the compression equipment markets. In these markets, Cameron competes principally with the Ariel Corporation, Atlas-Copco AB, CECO (a Compressor Engineering Corporation company), Demag, Dresser-Rand Company, FS-Elliott Company, LLC, Endyn Energy Dynamics, Hoerbiger Group and IR Air Solutions. The principal competitive factors in the compression equipment markets are engineering and design capabilities, product performance, reliability, quality, service and price. Cameron has a competent engineering staff and skilled technical and service representatives.
9 Table of Contents Manufacturing Cameron has manufacturing facilities worldwide that conduct a broad variety of processes, including machining, fabrication, assembly and testing, using a variety of forged and cast alloyed steels and stainless steel as the primary raw materials. In previous years, Cameron has rationalized plants and products, closed various manufacturing facilities, moved product lines to achieve economies of scale, and upgraded other facilities.In more recent times, the Company has constructed or begun construction on new facilities mainly in certain locations outside of North America in order to meet current and expected future demand, particularly with regard to its surface and subsea product offerings.This is an ongoing process as the Company seeks ways to improve delivery performance and reduce costs.Cameron maintains advanced manufacturing, quality assurance and testing equipment geared to the specific products that it manufactures and uses process automation in its manufacturing operations.Manufacturing facilities typically utilize computer-aided, numeric-controlled tools and manufacturing techniques that concentrate the equipment necessary to produce similar products in one area of the plant in a configuration commonly known as a manufacturing cell.One operator in a manufacturing cell can monitor and operate several machines, as well as assemble and test products made by such machines, thereby improving operating efficiency and product quality.
Camerons test capabilities are critical to its overall processes. The Company has the capability to test most equipment at rated operating conditions, measuring all operating parameters, efficiency and emissions. All process compressors for air separation and all plant air compressors are given a mechanical and aerodynamic test in a dedicated test center prior to shipment.
All of Camerons Asian, European and Latin American manufacturing plants are ISO certified and API licensed, and most of the U.S. plants are ISO certified. ISO is an internationally recognized verification system for quality management.
Backlog Camerons backlog was approximately $5.6 billion at December 31, 2008 (approximately 61% of which is expected to be shipped during 2009), as compared to $4.3 billion at December 31, 2007, and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2006.Backlog consists of customer orders for which a purchase order has been received, satisfactory credit or financing arrangements exist and delivery is scheduled.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property As part of its ongoing research, development and manufacturing activities, Cameron has a policy of seeking patents when appropriate on inventions involving new products and product improvements. Cameron owns 336 unexpired United States patents and 700 unexpired foreign patents. During 2008, 49 new U.S. and 68 new foreign patent applications were filed.
Although in the aggregate these patents are of considerable importance to the manufacturing of many of its products, Cameron does not consider any single patent or group of patents to be material to its business as a whole.
Trademarks are also of considerable importance to the marketing of Camerons products. Cameron considers the following trade names to be material to its business as a whole: CAMERON, COOPER-BESSEMER, AJAX, WILLIS and W-K-M. Other important trademarks used by Cameron include AOP, AXIS, BARTON, BFCC, C-B TURBOCHARGER, CALDON, CAMCHEC, CAMERONDC, CAMFORCE, CLIF MOCK, CONTROL SEAL, CSI, DEMCO, DEPURATOR, DRYPAK, DYNACENTRIC, DYNASEAL, EDGE, ENTECH, ENTERPRISE, EVO, FOSTER, GENERAL VALVE, GENUINE JOY, GROVE, H & H, IC, INTERNATIONAL VALVES LTD.

Cameron also relies on trade secret protection for its confidential and proprietary information. Cameron routinely enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees, partners and suppliers. There can be no assurance, however, that others will not independently obtain similar information or otherwise gain access to Camerons trade secrets.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The information set forth under the caption Factors That May Affect Financial Condition and Future Results on pages39 to 42 in the 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders is incorporated herein by reference.
ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS There were no unresolved comments from the SEC staff at the time of filing of this Form 10-K.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES The Company currently operates facilities ranging in size from approximately 600 square feet to approximately 1,243,000 square feet.In addition to its manufacturing facilities, the Company also owns and leases warehouses, distribution centers, aftermarket and storage facilities, sales and administrative offices. The Company leases its corporate headquarters office space and space for the DPS, V&M and CS division headquarters in Houston, Texas.
13 Table of Contents The Company manufactures, markets and sells its products and provides services throughout the world, operating facilities in numerous countries. At December 31, 2008, the significant facilities used by Cameron throughout the world for manufacturing, distribution, aftermarket services, machining, storage, warehousing, sales and administration contained an aggregate of approximately 12,131,000 square feet of space, of which approximately 6,992,000 square feet (58%) was owned and 5,139,000 (42%) was leased.Of this total, approximately 6,437,000 square feet of space (53%) is located in the Western Hemisphere, 3,872,000 square feet of space (32%) is located in the Eastern Hemisphere, 1,478,000 square feet of space (12%) is located in Asia Pacific and the Middle East and 344,000 square feet of space (3%) is located in West Africa.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is subject to a number of contingencies, including environmental matters, litigation and tax contingencies.
Environmental Matters The Companys worldwide operations are subject to regulations with regard to air, soil and water quality as well as other environmental matters. The Company, through its environmental management system and active third-party audit program, believes it is in substantial compliance with these regulations.
The Company is currently identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) with respect to two sites designated for cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) or similar state laws. One of these sites is Osborne, Pennsylvania (a landfill into which a predecessor of the CS operation in Grove City, Pennsylvania deposited waste), where remediation is complete and remaining costs relate to ongoing ground water treatment and monitoring. The other is believed to be a de minimis exposure. The Company is also engaged in site cleanup under the Voluntary Cleanup Plan of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality at former manufacturing locations in Houston and Missouri City, Texas. Additionally, the Company has discontinued operations at a number of other sites which had been active for many years. The Company does not believe, based upon information currently available, that there are any material environmental liabilities existing at these locations. At December 31, 2008, the Companys consolidated balance sheet included a noncurrent liability of approximately $6.8 million for environmental matters.
Legal Matters In 2001, the Company discovered that contaminated underground water from the former manufacturing site in Houston referenced above had migrated under an adjacent residential area. Pursuant to applicable state regulations, the Company notified the affected homeowners. Concerns over the impact on property values of the underground water contamination and its public disclosure led to a number of claims by homeowners.
The Company has entered into a number of individual settlements and has settled a class action lawsuit. Twenty-one of the individual settlements were made in the form of agreements with homeowners that obligated the Company to reimburse them for any estimated decline in the value of their homes at time of sale due to potential buyers concerns over contamination or, in the case of some agreements, to purchase the property after an agreed marketing period. Three of these agreements have had no claims made under them yet. The Company has also settled ten other property claims by homeowners who have sold their properties. In addition, the Company has settled Valice v. Cameron Iron Works, Inc. (80th Jud. Dist. Ct., Harris County, filed June 21, 2002), which was filed and settled as a class action. Pursuant to the settlement, the homeowners who remained part of the class are entitled to receive a cash payment of approximately 3% of the 2006 appraised value of their property or reimbursement of any diminution in value of their property due to contamination concerns at the time of any sale. To date, 71 homeowners have elected the cash payment.
14 Table of Contents Of the 258 properties included in the Valice class, there were 21 homeowners who opted out of the class settlement. There are three suits currently pending regarding this matter filed by non-settling homeowners. Moldovan v. Cameron Iron Works, Inc. (165th Jud. Dist. Ct., Harris County, filed October 23, 2006), was filed by six such homeowners. The other suits were filed by individual homeowners, Tuma v. Cameron Iron Works, Inc. (334th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, filed on November 27, 2006), and Rudelson v. Cooper Industries, Inc. (189th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, filed on November 29, 2006). The remaining homeowners who opted out of the class action settlement have retained counsel but have not filed suit.The complaints filed in these actions, and the claims asserted by the remaining homeowners, make the claim that the contaminated underground water has reduced property values and seek recovery of alleged actual and exemplary damages for the loss of property value.
While one suit related to this matter involving health risks has been filed, the Company is of the opinion that there is no health risk to area residents and that the suit is without merit.
The Company believes, based on its review of the facts and law, that any potential exposure from existing agreements, the class action settlement or other actions that have been or may be filed, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. The Companys consolidated balance sheet included a liability of $13.1 million for these matters as of December 31, 2008.
The Company has been named as a defendant in a number of multi-defendant, multi-plaintiff tort lawsuits since 1995. At December 31, 2008, the Companys consolidated balance sheet included a liability of approximately $3.2 million for such cases, including estimated legal costs. The Company believes, based on its review of the facts and law, that the potential exposure from these suits will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
Regulatory Contingencies In January 2007, the Company underwent a Pre-Assessment Survey as part of a Focused Assessment Audit initiated by the Regulatory Audit Division of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland Security.The Pre-Assessment Survey resulted in a finding that the Company had deficiencies in its U.S. Customs compliance process and had underpaid customs duties.The Company has taken corrective action and will close out all matters regarding duties owed on prior shipments in March 2009, which will require the payment of an additional $1.7 million for previously underpaid duties.The Company expects that assessment compliance testing will be completed and the Focused Assessment Audit will be concluded by the third quarter of 2009.
In July 2007, the Company was one of a number of companies to receive a letter from the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting information on their use of a freight forwarder and customs clearance broker. The DOJ is inquiring into whether certain of the services provided to the Company by the freight forwarder may have involved violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The Company is conducting an internal investigation in response, as discussed below, and is providing the requested information to the DOJ.
The Company engaged special counsel reporting to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors to conduct an investigation into its dealings with the freight forwarder to determine if any payment made to or by the freight forwarder and customs clearing broker on the Companys behalf constituted a violation of the FCPA. The investigation is also looking into activities of Company employees and agents with respect to immigration matters and importation permitting. To date, the special counsel has found that the Company utilized certain services in Nigeria offered by the customs broker that appear to be similar to services that have been under review by the DOJ. Special counsel is reviewing these and other services and activities to determine whether they were conducted in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Special counsel is also reviewing the extent, if any, of the Companys knowledge, and its involvement in the performance, of these services and activities and whether the Company fulfilled its obligations under the FCPA.
In addition, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is conducting an informal inquiry into the same matters currently under review by the DOJ. As part of this inquiry the SEC has requested that the Company provide to them the information and documents that have been requested by and are being provided to the DOJ. The Company is cooperating fully with the SEC, as it is doing with the DOJ, and is providing the requested materials. At this stage of the internal investigation, the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of either the internal investigation or the government inquiries. The Company has also undertaken an enhanced compliance training effort for its personnel, including foreign operations personnel dealing with customs clearance regulations and hired a Chief Compliance Officer in September 2008 to assume all legal compliance matters for the Company.
15 Table of Contents Tax Contingencies The Company has legal entities in over 35 countries. As a result, the Company is subject to various tax filing requirements in these countries. The Company prepares its tax filings in a manner which it believes is consistent with such filing requirements. However, some of the tax laws and regulations which the Company is subject to are subject to interpretation and/or judgment. Although the Company believes that the tax liabilities for periods ending on or before the balance sheet date have been adequately provided for in the financial statements, to the extent that a taxing authority believes that the Company has not prepared its tax filings in accordance with the authoritys interpretation of the tax laws/regulations, the Company could be exposed to additional taxes.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys Disclosure Committee and the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of December 31, 2008.In conducting managements evaluation as described above, the Surface Safety Systems business acquired from the Baker Hughes International Oil Tools division, SBS Oilfield Equipment GmbH, Jiskoot Holdings Limited, Dyna-Torque, Inc., Guibersen Well Service Systems, KB Industries and Paramount Pumps and Supplies, Inc., all acquired during 2008, were excluded.
