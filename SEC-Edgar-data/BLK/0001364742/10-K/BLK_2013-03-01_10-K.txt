BUSINESS Overview BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock or the Company) is an independent investment management firm with $3.561 trillion of assets under management (AUM) at December31, 2010. The Company is highly regulated, serves its clients as a fiduciary, and derives all of its revenues from client business. We focus exclusively on investment management and risk management; we do not engage in proprietary trading or other activities that could conflict with the interests of our clients. Our business is global: we invest in capital markets throughout the world, we have employees in 25 countries and we serve investors in more than 100 countries. Our clients include taxable, tax-exempt and official institutions, retail investors and high net worth individuals.
The 2009 combination of BlackRock and Barclays Global Investors (BGI) created a firm with unsurpassed breadth of investment expertise and risk management capabilities across the global capital markets. Our unique platform enables us to bring together active (alpha) investments with index (beta) products and risk management to develop tailored solutions for clients. Our product range includes single- and multi-asset class portfolios investing in equities, fixed income and/or money market instruments. We offer our products directly and through intermediaries in a variety of vehicles, including open-end and closed-end mutual funds, iShares  exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other exchange traded products (together with ETFs, ETPs), collective investment funds and separate accounts. We also offer our BlackRock Solutions  (BRS) investment systems, risk management and advisory services to institutional investors.
BlackRocks common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, BLK. A majority of our Board of Directors is independent, and we have no majority shareholder. On November15, 2010, certain of BlackRocks stockholders completed a $9.6 billion secondary offering through the sale of 58.7million shares held by Bank of America Corporation (Bank of America) through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Merrill Lynch& Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch), and The PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) at a price of $163.00. None of the proceeds of the offering went to the Company. At December31, 2010, Bank of America did not hold any of BlackRocks voting common stock outstanding and held approximately 7.1% of BlackRocks capital stock. PNC held approximately 25.3% of BlackRocks voting common stock outstanding and held approximately 20.3% of the Companys capital stock. Barclays Bank PLC (Barclays) held approximately 2.3% of BlackRocks voting common stock outstanding and held approximately 19.6% of the Companys capital stock.
BlackRock operates in a global marketplace characterized by a high degree of market volatility and economic uncertainty, factors that can significantly affect earnings and stockholder returns in any given period. Management seeks to achieve attractive returns for stockholders over time by, among other things, capitalizing on the following factors:  the Companys diversified product offerings, which enhance its ability to offer a variety of traditional and alternative investment products across the risk spectrum and to tailor single- and multi- asset class investment solutions to address specific client needs;  the Companys longstanding commitment to risk management and the continued development of, and increased interest in, BRS products and services;  the Companys global presence, with approximately 41% of employees outside the U.S. supporting local investment capabilities and serving clients of which approximately 44% of total AUM was managed for clients domiciled outside the U.S.; and  the growing recognition of the BlackRock brand globally, the strength of the Companys culture and the depth and breadth of its intellectual capital.
The Companys ability to increase revenue, earnings and stockholder value over time is predicated on its ability to generate new business in investment management and BlackRock Solutions products and services. New business efforts are dependent on BlackRocks ability to achieve clients investment objectives in a manner consistent with their risk preferences and to deliver excellent client service. All of these efforts require the commitment and contributions of BlackRock employees. Accordingly, the ability to attract and retain talented professionals is critical to the Companys long-term success.

See additional information in Item6, Selected Financial Data.
BlackRock reports its financial results using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP); however, management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain prior year non-GAAP data has been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
2 Table of Contents Item1.
BUSINESS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating Income, as Adjusted: GAAP reported operating income includes certain significant items, the after-tax impact of which management considers non-recurring or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value and, therefore, are excluded in calculating operating income, as adjusted.
Operating income, as adjusted (a non-GAAP measure), excludes certain expenses incurred related to the integration of the acquisitions of SSRM Holdings, Inc. (SSR), Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (MLIM), the fund of funds business of Quellos Group, LLC (Quellos) and BGI, as well as advisory fees, legal fees and consulting transaction expenses related to the BGI Transaction, a 2007 termination fee for closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, 2008 and 2009 restructuring charges and compensation expense associated with appreciation/(depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans. These expenses have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, because they have been deemed non-recurring by management and to help enhance the comparability of this information to prior periods.
The portion of compensation expense associated with certain of BlackRocks long-term incentive plan (LTIP) awards that has or will be funded through distributions to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and a Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution, a portion of which has been received, has been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of LTIP participants put options, primarily in the three months ended March31, 2007, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. A detailed discussion of the LTIP funded by PNC is included in Note 15, Stock-Based Compensation, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.
Compensation expense associated with appreciation/(depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non-operating income (expense).
Management believes that operating income exclusive of these costs is more representative of the operating performance for the respective periods.
Operating Margin, as Adjusted: Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Companys results until future periods.
Operating margin, as adjusted, allows the Company to compare performance from period-to-period by adjusting for items that may not recur, recur infrequently or may fluctuate based on market movements, such as restructuring charges, transaction/integration costs, closed-end fund launch costs and fluctuations in deferred compensation expense based on mark-to-market movements in investments held to fund certain compensation plans. The Company also uses operating margin, as adjusted, to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance to other companies. Management reviews both the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
3 Table of Contents Item1.
BUSINESS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating Margin, as Adjusted (continued): Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and to other third parties. Management believes that excluding such costs is useful to BlackRock because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. Reimbursable property management compensation represented compensation and benefits paid to personnel of Metric Property Management, Inc. (Metric), a subsidiary of BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (Realty). Prior to the transfer in 2008 to a third party, these employees were retained on Metrics payroll when certain properties were acquired by Realtys clients. The related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by Realtys clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they did not bear an economic cost to BlackRock. For each of these items, BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues.
Non-Operating Income (Expense), Less Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Non-controlling Interests, as Adjusted: Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted, equals non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis, less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, GAAP basis, adjusted for compensation expense associated with depreciation or appreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans. The compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis.
Management believes that non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted, provides for comparability of this information to prior periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRocks non-operating contribution to its consolidated results. As compensation expense associated with depreciation or appreciation on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, offsets the gain/(loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes that non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks non-operating results that impact book value.
Net Income Attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as Adjusted: GAAP reported net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc. and GAAP diluted earnings per common share include certain significant items, the after-tax impact of which management considers non-recurring or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value or do not have a cash flow impact and, therefore, are excluded in calculating net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted.
Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted (non-GAAP measures), exclude the after-tax impact of the 2008 and 2009 restructuring charges, the 2007 termination of closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, LTIP expense to be funded by PNC and by a Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution, a portion of which has been received, the SSR, MLIM, Quellos and BGI integration costs, BGI transaction costs and the effect on deferred income tax expense attributable to changes in corporate income tax rates as a result of enacted legislation.

(2) Compounded Annual Growth Rate AUM AUM represents assets that we manage on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM corresponds to the basis used for billing (for example, net asset value). Reported AUM does not include assets for which we provide risk management or other forms of non-discretionary advice, or assets that we are retained to manage on a short-term, temporary basis (for example, in a transition management mandate, as described below).
5 Table of Contents Item1.
BUSINESS (continued) Overview (continued) Investment management fees are typically expressed as a percentage of net asset value. On some products, we earn securities lending fees. We also earn performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreed-upon benchmark or return hurdle. In addition, BlackRock offers its Aladdin  investment system, as well as risk management, outsourcing and advisory services, to institutional investors under the BRS name. Revenue on these services may be based on several criteria including asset volume, number of users, accomplishment of specific deliverables or other objectives.
At December31, 2010, AUM was $3.561 trillion, representing a compound annual growth rate of 51% over the last five years. AUM growth during the period was achieved through net new business and mergers, including the acquisitions of MLIM in 2006, the fund of funds business of Quellos in 2007 and BGI in 2009. These acquisitions significantly changed our AUM mix, from predominantly fixed income in 2005 to a broadly diversified product range spanning asset classes and investment styles, as described below.

(2) Includes outflows due to manager concentration considerations and scientific active equity performance.
At year-end 2010, products invested primarily in long-term assets represented 88% of total AUM or $3.131 trillion, of which 54% were equity mandates, 36% fixed income accounts, 6% multi-asset class portfolios and 4% alternative investments. The remaining AUM was in cash management products and advisory mandates, which are long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. Net new business in long-term products totaled $131.2 billion, before giving effect to merger-related outflows (see below). Net inflows in long-term products were offset by net outflows in cash management products, as money market fund yields remained near zero and net distributions from advisory portfolios.
Unless stated otherwise, net new business figures are before giving effect to merger-related outflows of $121.0 billion, or less than 7% of the $1.8 trillion of AUM acquired in the BGI Transaction. The annualized investment advisory base fee loss associated with merger-related outflows is less than approximately $175 million.
* See Product Performance Notes below.
6 Table of Contents Item1.
BUSINESS (continued) Products (continued) Equity and Fixed Income Equity and fixed income AUM include a wide range of active and passive strategies. In total, equity AUM increased $158.4 billion or 10% to $1.694 trillion at year-end 2010. Growth was driven by $69.1 billion of net new business and $197.1 billion of investment performance and market appreciation. Fixed income AUM ended 2010 at $1.141 trillion, up $85.7 billion or 8% relative to December31, 2009. Net new business contributed $36.0 billion of the growth, while markets and investment performance contributed $66.1 billion. Merger-related outflows totaled $99.4 billion and $19.9 billion in equities and fixed income, respectively, primarily due to manager concentration and underperformance in scientific active equities. (See additional discussion under AUM by Style, below.) Multi-Asset Class BlackRocks multi-asset class AUM ended 2010 at $185.6 billion, an increase of 31% or $43.6 billion. During the year, we were awarded $26.3 billion of net new business and portfolio values rose $13.9 billion. BlackRocks multi-asset class team manages a variety of bespoke mandates that leverage our broad investment expertise in global equities, currencies, bonds and commodities and our extensive risk management capabilities. Investment solutions might include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments, as well as tactical asset allocation overlays. The products are described briefly below.
BlackRocks multi-asset class products were managed on behalf of a well-balanced client base. At December31, 2010, institutional investors represented 56% of multi-asset class AUM, while retail and high net worth investors accounted for 44%. Flows were almost evenly split as well, with $15.3 billion or 59% and $10.7 billion or 41% coming from institutional and retail and high net worth investors, respectively. The geographic mix was similarly diversified, with 59% of multi-asset class AUM managed for clients based in the Americas, 32% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and 9% in Asia-Pacific. During the year, clients in the Americas and EMEA awarded BlackRock net new business of $26.6 billion, which offset net outflows of $0.5 billion from clients in Asia-Pacific.
Asset allocation and balanced products represented 59% or $109.8 billion of multi-asset class AUM at year-end, up $23.0 billion on the strength of net new business of $14.0billion and favorable investment performance and market movements of $9.0billion. Our industry leading global allocation funds surpassed $70 billion in AUM in 2010.
Target date and target risk funds ended the year at $41.9 billion, or 23% of multi-asset class AUM, driven by net inflows of $7.5 billion, a year-over-year organic growth rate of 26% and portfolio appreciation of $4.5 billion. Products include our LifePath and LifePath Retirement Income  offerings, which are Qualified Default Investment Alternatives under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. These products utilize a proprietary asset allocation model that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investors expected retirement timing.
Fiduciary management services accounted for 15% or $28.6 billion of multi-asset class AUM at December31, 2010. AUM increased $4.1 billion during the year. These are complex mandates in which pension plan sponsors retain BlackRock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of plan management. Customized services include tailoring investment strategy to client-specific risk budgets and return objectives, working closely with the clients investment staff and trustees.
Volatile investor sentiment presented challenges for asset allocation strategies in 2010. While 35% of multi-asset class AUM achieved returns above their benchmarks or peer medians for the one year, longer-term results remained strong, with 81% of multi-asset class AUM outperforming for the three years and 87% for the five years ended December31, 2010.
7 Table of Contents Item1.
BUSINESS (continued) Products (continued) Alternative Investments BlackRock ended 2010 with $109.7 billion of AUM in its alternative investment products, an increase of $7.6 billion. Net outflows totaled $0.1 billion, as withdrawals and disbursements in real estate, currency and opportunistic funds were offset by inflows in single- and multi-strategy hedge funds, global macro funds, funds of hedge funds and commodity products. We believe that as investors adapt their asset allocation strategies to best meet their investment objectives in the current environment, they will continue to increase their use of alternative investments to complement their core holdings.
The alternative investment client base was predominantly institutional, representing 75% or $81.8billion of alternatives AUM with retail and high net worth investors comprising 8% or $9.3 billion of AUM at December31, 2010.
iShares comprised $18.6billion or 17% of ending AUM. The geographic mix was well diversified, with 55% of AUM managed for clients in the Americas, 24% for clients in EMEA and 21% for clients in Asia-Pacific.
During 2010, we launched BlackRock Alternative Investors (BAI) to coordinate our alternative investment efforts, including product management, business development and client service. The products offered under the BAI umbrella are described below.
Real estate debt and equity products managed by BlackRock totaled $12.9 billion at year-end. Offerings include high yield debt and core, value-added and opportunistic equity portfolios. Real estate AUM decreased $5.5 billion during the year, driven by $3.3 billion in net outflows and $2.2 billion in market declines. Market performance rebounded for U.S. funds in 2010 and showed continued strength in the U.K. and within separate accounts.
Funds of funds AUM increased $1.8 billion or 8% to $23.9 billion at December31, 2010, including $18.5 billion in funds of hedge funds and hybrid vehicles and $5.4 billion in private equity fund of funds. During the year, growth was driven by net inflows of $0.5 billion and $1.3 billion of investment and market performance. Performance was strong and a growing number of institutional clients worldwide sought our expertise in customized accounts and commingled vehicles.
Hedge funds ended the year with $25.9 billion of AUM in a variety of single-strategy, multi-strategy and global macro hedge funds, as well as portable alpha, distressed and opportunistic offerings. Products include both open-end hedge funds and similar products and closed-end funds that have been created to take advantage of specific opportunities over a defined, often longer-term investment horizon. Growth of $1.1 billion primarily came from $0.6 billion of net inflows into fixed income and multi-strategy hedge funds and strong investment and market performance of $1.8 billion across all strategies.
Currency and commodity mandates totaled $45.6 billion at year-end 2010. These products include a range of active and passive products primarily managed through institutional separate accounts. AUM increased $10.0 billion during the year, driven by $2.8 billion of net inflows, primarily in commodities and currency overlays and $7.1 billion of market appreciation. Our iShares commodities products represented $18.6 billion of AUM, which are not eligible to pay performance fees.
Cash Management and Securities Lending AUM in cash management products totaled $279.2 billion at December31, 2010, a decrease of $70.1 billion, or 20%, from AUM reported at year-end 2009. Investors continued to look for higher returns by reallocating balances to deposits and operations and to a lesser extent, longer-term investment products. Cash management products include taxable and tax-exempt money market funds and customized separate accounts. Portfolios may be denominated in U.S. dollar, euro or pound sterling.

BUSINESS (continued) Products (continued) Our cash management clientele is largely institutional, with 85% of cash AUM managed for institutions and 15% for retail and high net worth investors at year-end 2010. The investor base was also predominantly domestic, with 75% managed for investors in the Americas and 25% for clients in other regions, almost all EMEA-based. We suffered net outflows during the year, as investors sought higher yields in bank deposits, direct money market investments and as they became more confident of the market recovery, in longer-term assets. Clients also used their cash for operating purposes, as business investment increased and merger and acquisition activity increased. We expect these trends to continue, which will continue to put pressure on cash management flows.
The cash management team also invests the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios. Securities lending, which is offered as a potential source of incremental returns on long-term portfolios, is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk management. Fees for securities lending can be structured as a share of earnings and/or a percentage of the value of the cash collateral. The value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned is captured in the corresponding asset class in AUM. The value of the cash or securities collateral is not included in cash management AUM.
The combination of the legacy businesses, along with the addition of new lending mandates, has increased lendable inventory and solidified BlackRock as a top tier provider of lendable assets. Outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately $104 billion, down slightly from $111 billion at year-end 2009. Balance volatility throughout 2010 was lower than in recent years. Demand remained weak, as relatively few securities command premium lending fees. This trend is expected to continue through 2011, with a turnaround occurring when the end-borrowers of securities begin re-risking and putting their capital to work with more conviction.
BlackRock employs a conservative investment style that emphasizes quality, liquidity and superior client service throughout all market cycles. Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. BlackRocks Cash Management Risk Committee has established risk limits, such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits, across many of the products BlackRock manages, including over all of its cash management products. In the ordinary course of our business, there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed and no such instances, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to the Company. To the extent that daily evaluation/reporting of the profile of the portfolios identifies that a limit has been exceeded, the relevant portfolio will be adjusted. To the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit, the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team, which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers. While a risk limit may be waived, such temporary waivers are infrequent.

Long-term 1 product offerings include active and passive (index) strategies. The investment objective for active portfolios is to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle (alpha). In contrast, passive strategies seek to closely track the returns of the corresponding index (beta), generally by investing in the securities that comprise the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate the risk and return profile of the index.
The BGI Transaction included an at-scale index business that materially changed BlackRocks AUM mix. Index AUM, including institutional and iShares products, increased from 4% of AUM at year-end 2008 (prior to the BGI Transaction) to 54% of AUM at December31, 2010.
Although many clients use both active and passive strategies, the profile of these assets differs greatly. For example, clients often use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class pending reallocation to an active manager. This has the effect of increasing turnover on index AUM. In addition, institutional index assignments tend to be very large (multi-billion dollars) and priced at low fee rates. This has the effect of exaggerating the significance of net flows in institutional index on BlackRocks earnings.

We offer two types of active strategies: those that rely primarily on fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to drive security selection and portfolio construction. At year-end 2010, active long-term AUM increased $18.0 billion to $1.190 trillion at year-end, of which 28% was in equities, 50% in fixed income, 15% in multi-asset and 7% in alternatives. Favorable markets contributed $89.4 billion of growth, which was slightly offset by $2.0 billion of net outflows. AUM growth was significantly hampered by merger-related outflows of $64.6 billion, primarily in scientific active equities (SAE).
Active Equity BlackRocks active equity AUM closed the year at $334.5 billion, a decline of 4%, or $14.0 billion relative to year-end 2009. Net new business contributed $2.6 billion of growth, while investment and market performance added $41.7 billion. A wide variety of products are offered, including global and regional portfolios; value, growth and core products; large, mid and small cap strategies; and selected sector funds. We believe an improving U.S. economy, strong corporate balance sheets, and sustained strong growth in the emerging markets bodes well for equity markets in 2011, although geopolitical risk remains a potential drag on investor sentiment.
BlackRock manages active equity portfolios for a diverse base of institutional and retail and high net worth investors globally. At December31, 2010, approximately half of active equity AUM ($165.8 billion) was managed on behalf of institutional investors in separate accounts, collective investment trusts and mutual funds and half ($168.7 billion) for retail and high net worth investors, largely through open-end mutual funds and separately managed accounts. Approximately 46% of our active equity AUM was managed for investors based in the Americas, 39% in EMEA and 15% in Asia-Pacific.
Fundamental active equity ended 2010 with $239.1 billion in AUM. Net inflows of $3.9 billion in equity dividend, global, European and other regional strategies were offset by outflows of $0.2 billion in U.S. equity funds. Market appreciation of $30.4 billion bolstered AUM as equity markets rebounded late in the year. BlackRocks fundamental active equity investors seek to add value relative to a specified index or on an absolute basis primarily through security selection based on proprietary research and portfolio manager judgment. Performance was strong in European and emerging market products, as well as selected sector funds including: energy, natural resources and health sciences. In total, 62%, 65% and 77% of fundamental active equity AUM beat their benchmarks or peer medians for the one-, three- and five-year periods ended December31, 2010, respectively. During the year, we drew on existing talent to fill out the leadership team and attracted an experienced CIO for our U.S. fundamental active equity strategies.
11 Table of Contents Item1.
BUSINESS (continued) Products (continued)  Scientific active equity AUM declined 32% to $95.4 billion. Portfolio appreciation of $11.4 billion was insufficient to overcome BGI merger-related outflows of $52.6 billion, much of which was anticipated due to underperformance dating back to 2007 in key developed market products. SAE strategies seek superior investment outcomes through a stock selection process that aims to systematically find and exploit pricing opportunities, while rigorously managing risk and cost. During the year, we appointed a new head of the SAE business, who reorganized the team and instilled a strong performance culture that has begun to stabilize the asset base. Though still nascent, there are early signs of improvement, as 55%, 45% and 36% of SAE AUM outperformed their benchmarks or peer medians for the one-, three- and five-year periods ended December31, 2010, respectively.
Active Fixed Income BlackRocks active fixed income AUM ended 2010 at $592.3 billion, a slight decrease of 1% or $3.3 billion, from the previous years results. During the year, we had $22.1 billion of net outflows, partially offset by $32.3 billion of investment and market performance. Fixed income mandates are often tailored to client-specified liabilities, accounting, regulatory or rating agency requirements, or other investment policies. U.S. bonds enjoyed good absolute returns in 2010. Despite a slight pullback during the fourth quarter, the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Index returned 6.5% for the year. While sovereign credit risk remains a concern, particularly in parts of Europe, inflation is not expected to have a material impact on Federal Reserve policy in 2011.
Of BlackRocks total active fixed income AUM, 82% was managed on behalf of institutional investors and 18% for retail and high net worth investors. The client base reflects our historical roots, with 69% of active fixed income AUM managed for investors in the Americas, 23% for EMEA domiciled clients, and 8% for investors in the Asia-Pacific region. Net inflows of $1.3 billion from Asia-Pacific clients were more than offset by outflows of $23.4 billion from investors in the Americas and EMEA.
Fundamental fixed income AUM totaled $553.5 billion, or 93% of active fixed income AUM, at year-end 2010. These products emphasize risk-controlled sector rotation and security selection driven by sector experts and direct interaction with issuers and market makers. Fundamental strategies experienced net outflows of $10.2 billion largely driven by client changes in overall asset allocation and long-term performance concerns. In addition, $8.8 billion of fixed income assets, on which we have been waiving fees for more than a year, transferred to cash management. Market appreciation contributed $30.5 billion to ending AUM. Positive flows in U.S. municipal bonds of $2.0 billion were buoyed by the successful launch of the $1.2 billion Build America Bond Trust in the third quarter of the year. Fundamental taxable fixed income strategies achieved strong performance in 2010, with 72%, 49% and 49% of AUM above their benchmarks or peer medians for the one-, three-, and five-year periods ended December31, 2010, respectively.
Model-driven fixed income AUM declined $3.9 billion or 9%, ending the year at $38.8 billion. Investment and market performance of $1.7 billion was insufficient to overcome $3.2 billion of outflows. These strategies employ models to identify relative return opportunities and to apply those results, subject to a pragmatic review of model risk, on a systematic basis across portfolios. Performance in our model-driven fixed income strategies was mixed, with 66%, 81% and 92% of AUM above their benchmarks or peer medians for the one-, three- and five-year periods ended December31, 2010, respectively.
Multi-Asset and Alternatives Virtually all (98%)of AUM in multi-asset class mandates, and the majority (75%)of AUM in alternative investments are managed in active strategies. These products are discussed earlier. (See the corresponding sections under Products  Asset Classes.) 12 Table of Contents Item1.

(2) Includes outflows due to manager concentration considerations and scientific active equity performance.
Institutional index AUM, generally managed in common trust funds or separate accounts, comprised 38% of total AUM at December31, 2010. AUM growth was driven by net new business of $89.2 billion and market appreciation of $143.9 billion. Merger-related outflows of $55.3 billion were concentrated among a relatively small number of clients. Where possible, we worked with these investors to address manager concentration issues by reallocating commoditized, low fee AUM, while retaining significant relationships and opportunities.
Equity products comprised 68% of institutional index AUM, ending the year at $911.8 billion, driven by net inflows of $44.6 billion and $110.4 billion of market appreciation. Net inflows in global, U.S. equity and other regional strategies were partially offset by outflows of $2.7 billion in other low fee currency overlays for equity strategies. Toward the end of the year, investors began to reallocate to higher return asset classes, helping to fuel a recovery in the global equity markets. Institutional index equity portfolios closely tracked their respective benchmarks, with 97%, 96% and 98% of AUM at or above tracking error tolerance for one-, three-, and five-year periods.
Fixed income products represented 32% or $425.9 billion of institutional index AUM, an increase of 19% or $68.4 billion. Net new business totaled $39.1 billion fueled by $12.8 billion of net inflows primarily in liability hedging strategies. Investors remained risk averse largely due to the European sovereign debt crisis in the first half of the year, favoring low risk fixed income exposures. As global markets stabilized and a recovery in the U.S. looked increasingly likely, equity markets recovered and investor confidence returned. Institutional index fixed income portfolios closely tracked their respective benchmarks, with 92%, 94% and 98% of AUM at or above tracking error tolerance for one-, three-, and five-year periods.
Less than 1% of institutional index AUM is in alternatives or multi-asset class products. (See discussions under Products  Asset Classes, above.) 13 Table of Contents Item1.

iShares is the leading ETF provider in the world, with $590.2 billion of AUM at December31, 2010, an increase of $96.0 billion or 19% since year-end 2009. We were the top asset gatherer globally in 2010 2 , with $44.0 billion of net inflows complemented by $52.0 billion of market appreciation. We also introduced 78 new ETPs during the year, maintaining our dual commitment to innovation and responsible product structuring. Our broad product range offers investors the building blocks required to assemble diversified portfolios and implement tactical asset allocation strategies and the liquidity required to make adjustments to their exposures quickly and cost-efficiently.
The market for ETPs continues to grow globally, with investor preference driven to varying degrees by performance (as measured by tracking error, which is the difference between net returns on the ETP and the corresponding index), liquidity (bid-ask spread), tax-efficiency, transparency and client service. Flows also reflect investor risk appetite, which shifted toward fixed income and, within equities, to broad and single country emerging market funds in 2010. In early 2011, investors have begun to shift equity allocations back to developed markets.
At year-end, our iShares product mix included $448.2 billion, or 76%, in equity offerings, and $123.1 billion, or 21%, in bond ETPs. The remaining $19.0 billion or 3% of iShares AUM was in multi-asset and alternative investments.
iShares equity AUM increased $66.8 billion or 18% versus 2009, with $21.9 billion in net inflows and $44.9 billion of market and foreign exchange appreciation.
iShares fixed income AUM rose $20.6 billion or 20% over the previous year, with 92% of the increase being driven by $19.0 billion of net inflows.
iShares multi-asset and alternatives AUM grew by $8.6 billion or 84%, with $3.2 billion of net inflows, predominately in commodity products such as gold and silver, and $5.5 billion of market and foreign exchange appreciation.
In total, we had net inflows in 315 different ETPs during 2010. As of year-end, we managed three of the top five, six of the top ten, and twelve of the 20 largest ETFs in the U.S.
2 Our iShares offerings were traded on 19 exchanges throughout the world. These included 276 funds 2 in the Americas with $480.3 billion, or 81%, of iShares AUM. Assets in these funds increased $77.6 billion, or 19%, during the year, including $27.8 billion of net inflows.

BUSINESS (continued) Products (continued) Notwithstanding a substantial increase in the number of ETP sponsors and products, iShares has maintained market share of more than 48% in the U.S. and 36% in EMEA 3 . In addition, we are the largest ETF manager in Mexico, have pioneered the product in Chile and Peru, and have introduced products in Brazil, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan. Importantly, our share of revenues is significantly higher due to our product mix. In general, we expect to maintain our pricing, so long as it is supported by performance and the iShares value proposition, although we continually seek to achieve efficiencies and pass them through to our clients.
BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock offers investment systems, risk management, outsourcing and advisory services under the BlackRock Solutions brand name. Over $10.0 trillion of positions are processed on our Aladdin operating platform, which serves as the investment system for BlackRock and a growing number of sophisticated institutional investors around the world. BRS also offers comprehensive risk reporting via the Green Package  and risk management advisory services, interactive fixed income analytics through our web-based calculator, AnSer  , middle and back office outsourcing services and investment accounting. Clients have also retained BRS Financial Markets Advisory (FMA) group for a variety of engagements, such as valuation and risk assessment of illiquid assets, portfolio restructuring, workouts and dispositions of distressed assets and financial and balance sheet strategies.
As global capital markets have recovered, clients have focused more on risk management, and demand for BRS services continues to be robust. During the year, BRS added 62 net new assignments. While revenue declined modestly by 4% to $460 million, demand was strong for Aladdin and risk management services, with year-over-year revenue growing 14%, particularly in EMEA where we signed a record number of new BRS clients onto the platform.
Aladdin assignments are long-term contracts providing significant recurring revenue.
During the year we added 49 new FMA assignments and completed 33 engagements. The nature of FMA assignments shifted from urgent, short-term risk analyses to longer term advisory and risk monitoring engagements, with year-over-year revenue declining 23%, as the crisis subsided and fewer clients required emergency valuation and liquidation services. Advisory AUM decreased 7% to $150.7 billion, with $1.5 billion of market appreciation insufficient to offset $12.0 billion of client distributions in these long-term liquidation portfolios.
At year-end, BRS served 149 clients, including banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers and other institutional investors across North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. During the year, BlackRock acquired and integrated Helix Financial Group LLC to enhance BRS  commercial real estate capabilities, which proved to be critical to BRS  success in winning several high profile assignments. We will continue to consider acquisition opportunities that can expand Aladdin functionality and our risk management expertise.
The BRS and Aladdin teams are also supporting key aspects of the BGI integration. These efforts are vital to establishing a unified operating platform and consistent operating processes. We expect functionality added in connection with the integration to enhance the Aladdin platform over time. Additionally, we will seek to leverage our scale for the benefit of our clients through the creation of a robust global trading platform and other initiatives.
Transition Management Services BlackRock also offers transition management services, involving the temporary oversight of a clients assets as they transition from one manager to another or from one strategy to another. We provide a comprehensive service that includes project management and implementation based on achieving best execution consistent with the clients risk management tolerances. We use state-of-the-art tools and work closely with BlackRocks trading cost research team to manage four dimensions of risk throughout the transition: exposure, execution, process and operational risk. The average transition assignment is executed within two weeks, although the duration can be longer or shorter depending on the size, complexity and liquidity of the related assets. These portfolios are not included in AUM unless BlackRock has been retained to manage the assets after the transition phase.

BUSINESS (continued) Products (continued) Risk& Quantitative Analysis Across all asset classes, in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams, the Risk& Quantitative Analysis (RQA) group at BlackRock provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes, identifies and helps manage counterparty and operational risks, coordinates standards for firmwide investment performance measurement and determines risk management-related analytical and information requirements. Where appropriate, RQA will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics.
Product Performance Notes Past performance is not indicative of future results. The performance information for actively managed accounts reflects U.S. open-end and closed-end mutual funds and similar EMEA-based products with respect to peer median comparisons, and actively managed institutional separate accounts and funds located globally with respect to benchmark comparisons, as determined using objectively based internal parameters, using the most current information available as of December 31, 2010. The performance information does not include funds or accounts that are not measured against a benchmark, private equity products, CDOs, or accounts managed by BlackRocks Financial Markets Advisory Group. Comparisons are based on gross-of-fee performance for U.S.-based products and institutional separate accounts, and net-of-fee performance for EMEA-based products. The performance tracking information for institutional index accounts is based on gross-of-fee performance as of December31, 2010, and includes all institutional accounts globally using an index strategy. AUM information is based on AUM for each account or fund in the asset class shown without adjustment for overlapping management of the same account or fund, as of December31, 2010. Source of performance information and peer medians is BlackRock, Inc. and is based in part on data from Lipper Inc. for U.S. funds and Morningstar, Inc. for non-U.S. funds. Fund performance reflects the reinvestment of dividends and distributions, but does not reflect sales charges.

BlackRock serves institutional and retail and high net worth investors in more than 100 countries through the efforts of professionals located in 25 countries. We strive to leverage our global expertise and scale, together with our understanding of local requirements and business customs, to most effectively serve our clients. Portfolios may be invested in local, regional or global capital markets. Products may be structured to address location-specific issues, such as regulations, taxation, operational infrastructure, market liquidity, and client-specific issues, such as investment policy, liability structure and ratings.
In order to enhance our ability to best serve our clients and develop our talent, we modified our matrix organizational structure in 2010 to reinforce the teamwork required among global functions and regions. The global functions  Portfolio Management, BRS, Global Clients, and Corporate& Business Operations  are key to driving coordination and consistency, and to achieving the benefits of our scale. The regions  Americas, EMEA, and Asia-Pacific  support local clients, employees, regulators and business strategy. At December31, 2010, 44% of our AUM was managed for clients outside the U.S., and 41% of employees were based outside the U.S. We expect these figures to approach 50% over the coming years.

Growth was driven by $78.4 billion in net new business in long-term products and $177.3 billion in investment performance and market appreciation. Clients are served through offices in Brazil, Canada, Chile, Mexico, Spain and throughout the U.S.
Offerings include closed-end funds and iShares traded on domestic stock exchanges, a full range of open-end mutual funds, collective investment funds, common trusts, private funds and separate accounts. The long-term product mix is well diversified and proportional to the firms mix: 57% in equities, 34% in fixed income, 6% in multi-asset class and 3% in alternatives. By comparison, cash management offerings predominantly serve clients in the Americas. We also have a wide variety of BRS assignments for institutional investors and governmental entities in the U.S. and Canada.
17 Table of Contents Item1.
BUSINESS (continued) Clients (continued) The mix by investment style is also balanced, with 39% of long-term AUM managed in active products, 35% in institutional index accounts and 26% in iShares and other ETPs at year-end. Note that the iShares figures are based on the jurisdiction of the fund, rather than the underlying investor. Non-U.S. investors often prefer U.S.
iShares , primarily due to the depth of the markets and liquidity of the products.
EMEA AUM for clients based in EMEA ended the year at $1.017 trillion or 29% of total AUM, an increase of $79.7 billion from 2009. During the year, clients awarded us net new business of $28.0 billion, including inflows from investors in 24 countries across the region. Our offerings include fund families in the U.K., Luxembourg and Dublin, and iShares listed on stock exchanges throughout Europe, as well as separate accounts and pooled investment products.
Clients invested across the entire product spectrum with 51% of long-term AUM in equities, 40% in fixed income, 6% in multi-asset class and 3% in alternatives. EMEA clients constitute the remaining 25% of our cash management AUM, and represent just 3% of our advisory AUM. BRS has steadily built its presence in EMEA, including Aladdin relationships with a variety of institutional investors and FMA engagements for financial services companies and official institutions, including the valuation assignment announced in January 2011 for the Central Bank of Ireland.
The mix by investment style is slightly more concentrated than in the Americas, with 36% invested in active products, 53% in institutional index accounts and 11% in iShares and other ETPs. The relatively higher percentage in institutional index is driven by low fee institutional liability hedging portfolios which account for approximately 25% of total institutional index assets. The relatively lower percentage in iShares primarily reflects the fact that the European ETP market is at an earlier stage of development.
Asia-Pacific Clients in the Asia-Pacific region are served through offices in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Korea, and joint ventures in China and India. At December31, 2010, we managed $367.2 billion of AUM for clients in the region, an increase of 5% or $16.2 billion from 2009. Net new business contributed $15.4 billion, and the remainder of the increase was attributable to investment performance and favorable market movements. We also acquired the Taiwan-based asset manager Primasia Investment Trust Co. Ltd, strengthening our onshore investment capabilities by offering locally managed investment solutions.
At year-end, the mix of long-term products managed for these clients consisted of 46% equities, 43% fixed income, 5% multi-asset class and 6% alternative investments. Asia-Pacific clients represented 2% of our advisory AUM and less than 1% of our cash management AUM. BRS served a select number of the largest and most sophisticated investors in the region.
The mix among investment styles was more tilted toward institutional index accounts than in the other regions, with $219.9 billion or 61% of long-term AUM in these products. This bias can be traced to the presence of very large governmental institutions and pensions that are heavy users of index products. Asia-Pacific institutional investors also use iShares for tactical allocation, but often favor the liquidity of the U.S. products (which are counted in Americas iShares ). Active mandates represented 36% of AUM managed for investors in the region at year-end.

We serve a diverse mix of institutional and retail investors worldwide. Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third party fund sponsors; and retail and high net worth investors. We also serve both institutional and retail and high net worth investors who acquire iShares on exchanges worldwide ( iShares is discussed under Products, above).
Institutional Investors Assets managed for institutional investors totaled $2.556 trillion or 72% of total AUM at year-end 2010. During the year, net new business, excluding merger-related outflows, in long-term products totaled $60.3 billion, which was partially offset by $38.4 billion of net outflows in cash management and $12.0 billion of net distributions in advisory assignments. Investment performance and market appreciation contributed $201.2 billion of additional AUM growth.

BUSINESS (continued) Clients (continued) BlackRocks institutional AUM is well diversified by both product and region. Long-term AUM was $2.167 trillion at year-end, 49% of which was in equities, 42% fixed income, 5% multi-asset class and 4% alternatives. The mix by investment style was 38% active and 62% passive (excluding institutional investors in iShares ). As noted earlier, institutional index accounts tend to be very large mandates managed for relatively low fee rates and subject to higher turnover.
We serve institutional investors on six continents, with 55% of AUM managed on behalf of investors in the Americas, 32% in EMEA and 13% in Asia-Pacific. Institutional clients are further diversified by sub-segments: tax-exempt, official institutions, taxable and cash investors, as described below.
BlackRock is among the largest managers of pension plan assets in the world, with $1.487 trillion, or 58%, of institutional AUM managed for defined benefit, defined contribution and other pension plans for corporations, governments and unions at December31, 2010. An additional $57.0 billion was managed for other tax-exempt investors, including charities, foundations and endowments. Assets managed for these clients grew $90.4 billion during 2010, including $18.4 billion of net inflows from defined contribution plans, which represent an important and growing component of the retirement market.
We also managed $245.4 billion or 10% of institutional AUM for official institutions, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals, multilateral entities and government ministries and agencies. These clients often require specialized investment policy advice, the use of customized benchmarks and training support. In addition, BRS has been selected by a number of official institutions to provide a range of services, including Aladdin , risk management and financial markets advisory assignments.
BlackRock is the top independent manager of assets for insurance companies, which accounted for $218.6 billion or 9% of institutional AUM at year-end. These clients awarded us $4.6 billion of net new business, driven by a trend toward outsourcing, particularly in Europe last year. Assets managed for other taxable institutions, including corporations, banks and third party fund sponsors for which we provide sub-advisory services, totaled $326.6 billion or 13% of institutional AUM at year-end.
The remaining $221.7 billion or 9% of institutional AUM was managed on behalf of taxable and tax-exempt institutions invested in our cash management products at December31, 2010. See the Product section above for additional information on our cash management AUM.
Retail and High Net Worth Investors BlackRock serves retail and high net worth investors globally through separate accounts, open-end and closed-end funds, unit trusts and private investment funds. At December31, 2010, assets managed for retail and high net worth investors totaled $414.7 billion, up 8%, or $31.3 billion, versus year-end 2009 AUM. During the year, net inflows of $26.9 billion in long-term products were partially offset by $21.9 billion of net outflows in money market funds. Investment performance and market appreciation contributed $31.1 billion of additional AUM growth.
Retail and high net worth investors are served principally through intermediaries, including broker-dealers, banks, trust companies, insurance companies and independent financial advisors. Clients invest primarily in mutual funds, which totaled $318.2 billion or 77% of retail and high net worth AUM at year-end, with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts. The product mix is well diversified, with 47% of long-term AUM in equities, 29% in fixed income, 22% in multi-asset class and 2% in alternatives. The vast majority (98%)of long-term AUM is invested in active products, although this is partially inflated by the fact that iShares is shown independently, since we cannot identify all of the underlying investors.
The client base is also diversified geographically, with 68% of long-term AUM managed for investors based in the Americas, 23% in EMEA, and 9% in Asia-Pacific. The remaining $40.7 billion, or 10%, of retail and high net worth AUM is invested in cash management products, principally money market funds offered in the U.S. Our success in each of these regions reflects strong relationships with intermediaries and an established ability to deliver our global investment expertise in funds and other products tailored to local regulations and requirements.

BUSINESS (continued) Clients (continued) Our retail and high net worth offerings include the BlackRock Funds in the U.S., our Luxembourg cross-border fund families, BlackRock Global Funds (BGF), BlackRock Strategic Funds and a range of retail funds in the U.K. BGF is comprised of 61 funds and is registered in 35 countries. Over 60% of the funds are rated by S&P. In 2010, we were ranked as the second largest cross border fund provider 4 . In the U.K., we ranked among the six largest fund managers 4 , and are known for our innovative product offerings, including the absolute alpha products we introduced in 2005. In the U.S., we had over 50 product placements on broker-dealer platforms during the year and have grown our market position from tenth to fourth largest fund manager since we acquired MLIM in late-2006 5 . In 2010, BlackRock won the Dalbar award for customer service in financial services, the eleventh occasion on which we have been recognized for outstanding achievement in this area.
Competition BlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products, investment style and discipline, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service. Certain of the Companys competitors, however, have greater marketing resources than BlackRock, particularly in retail channels. These factors may place BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage and there can be no assurance that the Companys strategies and efforts to maintain its existing AUM and to attract new business will be successful.

22 Table of Contents Item1.
BUSINESS (continued) Regulation Virtually all aspects of BlackRocks business are subject to various laws and regulations both in and outside the United States, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, investors in registered and unregistered investment companies, trust customers of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (BTC) and the bank subsidiaries of Bank of America and PNC and their customers. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and financial and bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, such as BlackRock and its subsidiaries, have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations, censures and fines. The rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature and does not purport to be complete.
Regulatory Reform On July21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the DFA) was signed into law in the United States. The DFA is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions in order to be implemented. The adoption of these regulations and decisions will in large measure determine the impact of the DFA on BlackRock. The DFA may significantly change BlackRocks operating environment in unpredictable ways. It is not possible to predict the ultimate effects that the DFA, or subsequent implementing regulations and decisions, will have upon BlackRocks business and results of operations. Among the potential impacts of the DFA, provisions of the DFA referred to as the Volcker Rule could affect the method by which BlackRock invests in and operates its private equity funds, hedge funds and fund of funds platforms. In addition, BlackRock could become designated as a systemically important financial institution (SIFI) and become subject to direct supervision by the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve). If BlackRock were designated as a SIFI, it could be subject to enhanced prudential, supervisory and other requirements, such as risk-based capital requirements; leverage limits; liquidity requirements; resolution plan and credit exposure report requirements; concentration limits; a contingent capital requirement; enhanced public disclosures; short-term debt limits; and overall risk management requirements. Further, proposed regulations under the DFA, relating to regulation of swaps and derivatives, could impact the manner by which BlackRock and BlackRock advised funds use and trade swaps and other derivatives, and could expose BlackRock to increased costs as the derivatives market moves toward central clearing and increased position reporting. Other jurisdictions outside the United States in which BlackRock operates are also in the process of devising or considering more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry, which could have a similar impact on BlackRock.
The DFA and its regulations, and other new laws or regulations, or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRocks business activities; require BlackRock to change certain business practices; and expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and tax costs) and liabilities, as well as reputational harm. For example, in addition to regulatory changes mandated by the DFA, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) has adopted new regulations related to, and continues to review the role and risks related to, money market funds and have indicated that it may adopt additional regulations. Some of the proposed changes, if adopted, could significantly alter money market fund products and the entire money market fund industry. Similarly, the SEC continues to review the distribution fees paid to mutual fund distributors in accordance with Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which are important to a number of the mutual funds we manage. Any changes to 12b-1 fees would alter the way our distribution partners distribute our products. Regulatory changes could also lead to business disruptions, could materially and adversely impact the value of assets in which BlackRock has invested directly and/or on behalf of clients, and, to the extent the regulations strictly control the activities of financial services firms, could make it more difficult for BlackRock to conduct certain businesses or distinguish itself from competitors.
Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by regulators and self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations may directly affect the method of operation and profitability of BlackRock. BlackRocks profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce.
23 Table of Contents Item1.
BUSINESS (continued) Regulation (continued) U.S. Regulation BlackRock and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries are subject to regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the Department of Labor (the DOL), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States (the OCC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the National Futures Association (the NFA), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC) and other government agencies and regulatory bodies. Certain of BlackRocks U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering regulations and economic sanctions, laws and regulations established by various agencies.
The Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act), imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as BlackRock, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act), imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as BlackRock. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment advisers registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.
BlackRocks trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as well as the rules of various U.S. and non-U.S. securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g., volume limitations, reporting obligations) and market regulation policies in the United States and globally. Depending on the scope of the rules to be adopted by the SEC, provisions of the DFA added to the Exchange Act may require certain BlackRock subsidiaries to register as municipal advisers in relation to their services for state and local governments, pension plans and other investment programs, such as college savings plans. In addition, BlackRock manages a variety of investment funds listed on U.S. and non-U.S. exchanges, which are subject to the rules of such exchanges. Violation of these laws and regulations could result in restrictions on the Companys activities and in damage to its reputation. BlackRock manages a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate funds, collective investment trusts, managed futures funds and hybrid funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the investment community and the public, increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities, record-keeping and reporting, the scope of anti-fraud protections, safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters. BlackRock may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation, rule-making or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators.
Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the DOL, insofar as they act as a fiduciary under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require BlackRock to carry bonds ensuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to non-benefit plan clients.
24 Table of Contents Item1.
BUSINESS (continued) Regulation (continued) BlackRock has two subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisers, two other subsidiaries that are registered as commodity trading advisers and three additional subsidiaries only registered as commodity pool operators with the CFTC. All seven of these subsidiaries are members of the NFA. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments, including swaps as a result of the DFA, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. Four of BlackRocks other subsidiaries, BlackRock Investments, LLC (BRIL), BlackRock Capital Markets, LLC, BlackRock Execution Services, and BlackRock Fund Distribution Company (BFDC) are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealers permitted activities. BRIL is also an approved person with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). BRIL and BFDC are members of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) and are subject to MSRB rules.
U.S. Banking Regulation Each of Bank of America and PNC is a bank holding company and a financial holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHC Act). Based on Bank of Americas and PNCs current and/or prior ownership interests in BlackRock, BlackRock is deemed to be a non-bank subsidiary of Bank of America and PNC and is therefore subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve and to most banking laws, regulations and orders that apply to Bank of America and PNC. The supervision and regulation of Bank of America, PNC and their respective subsidiaries under applicable banking laws is intended primarily for the protection of their respective banking subsidiaries, their depositors, the deposit insurance funds of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the banking system as a whole, rather than for the protection of stockholders, creditors or clients of Bank of America, PNC or BlackRock. Bank of Americas and PNCs relationships and good standing with their regulators are important to the conduct of BlackRocks business. BlackRock may also be subject to foreign banking laws and supervision that could affect its business.
BTC is a national trust company that does not accept deposits and is a member of the Federal Reserve System. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as capital adequacy, regulations governing fiduciaries, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. BTC is also subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTCs customers, and not BTC, BlackRock and its affiliates or BlackRocks shareholders.
BlackRock generally may conduct only activities that are authorized for a financial holding company under the BHC Act. Investment management is an authorized activity, but must be conducted within applicable regulatory requirements, which in some cases are more restrictive than those BlackRock faces under applicable securities laws. BlackRock may also invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which it provides advisory, administrative or other services, to the extent consistent with applicable law and regulatory interpretations. The Federal Reserve has broad powers to approve, deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices for BlackRock to conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses or assets, or reconfigure existing operations. There are limits on the ability of bank subsidiaries of Bank of America and PNC to extend credit to or conduct other transactions with BlackRock. Bank of America, PNC and their subsidiaries are also subject to examination by various banking regulators, which results in examination reports and ratings that may adversely impact the conduct and growth of BlackRocks businesses.
The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over BlackRock, including the power to prohibit BlackRock from conducting any activity that, in the Federal Reserves opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting BlackRocks business. The Federal Reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of applicable banking laws, regulations and orders. The DFA strengthened the Federal Reserves supervisory and enforcement authority over a bank holding companys non-bank affiliates, such as BlackRock.
25 Table of Contents Item1.
BUSINESS (continued) Regulation (continued) Any failure of either Bank of America or PNC to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain BlackRock activities and its growth. Such a change of status could be caused by any failure of one of Bank of Americas or PNCs bank subsidiaries to remain well capitalized, by any examination downgrade of one of Bank of Americas or PNCs bank subsidiaries, or by any failure of one of Bank of Americas or PNCs bank subsidiaries to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. In addition, the DFA broadened the requirements for maintaining financial holding company status by now also requiring the holding company to remain well capitalized and well managed.
Non-U.S. Regulation BlackRocks international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. regulatory agencies and bodies. As BlackRock continues to expand its international presence, a number of its subsidiaries and international operations have become subject to regulatory systems comparable to those affecting its operations in the United States.
The Financial Services Authority (the FSA) currently regulates certain BlackRock subsidiaries in the United Kingdom. Authorization by the FSA is required to conduct any financial services related business in the United Kingdom pursuant to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FSAs rules govern a firms capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients and systems and controls. Breaches of these rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against the Companys U.K.-regulated subsidiaries. The U.K. government has announced that it intends to abolish the FSA and to establish three new regulatory bodies, the Financial Policy Committee, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority in its place. More detailed proposals, including draft legislation, are expected early in 2011 with the aim being for the new regulatory structure to be in place by the end of 2012.
In addition to the above, the Companys U.K.-regulated subsidiaries and other European subsidiaries and branches, must comply with the pan-European regime established by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), which came into effect on November1, 2007 and regulates the provision of investment services throughout the European Economic Area, as well as the Capital Requirements Directive, which delineates regulatory capital requirements. MiFID sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. It also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements.
The United Kingdom has adopted the MiFID rules into national legislation, as have those other European jurisdictions (excluding Switzerland which is not part of the EU) in which BlackRock has a presence. A review of MiFID by the European Commission is in process and is likely to result in further regulation including changes to pre- and post-trade reporting obligations and an expansion of the types of instruments subject to these requirements. It may also result in changes to other areas, such as firms conduct of business requirements. In addition, the new EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive has been approved by the European Parliament in final form and is likely to be implemented by the summer of 2013. This directive will regulate managers of, and service providers to, alternative investment funds domiciled within Europe and the marketing of all alternative investment funds into Europe. There are also ongoing plans to reform the framework to which regulated firms are subject, including in relation to regulatory capital and the protection of client assets.

BUSINESS (continued) Regulation (continued) In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the European Commission set out a detailed plan for EU financial reform, outlining a number of initiatives to be reflected in new or updated directives, regulations and recommendations. UCITS IV, the next iteration of the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) directive, is required to be adopted in the national law of each EU member state by July1, 2011. This directive will introduce a requirement for UCITS funds to provide a key investor information document. There are also European Commission consultations in process that are intended to improve retail investor protection and create a consistent framework and approach for certain insurance wrap products (referred to in the United Kingdom as packaged retail investment products), and regarding UCITS V, which is addressing, among other items, custodial liability. In the United Kingdom, the Bribery Act 2010, which is not yet in effect, will impose additional burdens on the Companys U.K.-regulated subsidiaries. In addition, a retail distribution review has been initiated by the FSA, and is expected to change how investment advice is paid for in the United Kingdom for all investment products. Final retail distribution rules are expected in early 2011, with implementation to occur by the end of 2012.
In addition to the FSA, the activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices are overseen by comparable regulators in Germany, The Netherlands, Ireland, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey, France, Belgium, Italy, Poland, Spain and Sweden. Regulators in these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant or cancel required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements. Other BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices are regulated in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, India, Dubai, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Canada.
In Japan, certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (the FIEL) and the Law Concerning Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the JFSA), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEL.
In Australia, BlackRocks subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (the ASIC) and the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (the APRA). The ASIC regulates companies and financial services in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection. The APRA is the prudential regulator of the Australian financial services industry and oversees banks, credit unions, building societies, general insurance and reinsurance companies, life insurance, friendly societies and most members of the superannuation (pension) industry. Failure to comply with applicable law and regulations could result in the cancellation, suspension or variation of the regulated subsidiaries licenses in Australia.
The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (the SFO) which governs the securities and futures markets and the non-bank retail leveraged foreign exchange market in Hong Kong. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (the SFC), an independent non-governmental body. The relevant subsidiaries, and certain individuals representing them, which conduct business in any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are generally required to be registered or licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC from time to time.
There are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many other non-U.S. jurisdictions where BlackRocks subsidiaries are authorized to conduct business.

Item1A.
RISK FACTORS As a leading investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of BlackRocks business. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. While BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market and operating risks, BlackRocks business, financial condition, operating results or non-operating results could be materially adversely affected, or our stock price could decline by any of the following risks.
Risks Related to BlackRocks Business and Competition Changes in the value levels of the capital, commodities or currency markets or other asset classes could lead to a decline in revenues and earnings.
BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns earned on AUM. Movements in equity, debt or commodity market prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates could cause:  the value of AUM to decrease;  the returns realized on AUM to decrease;  clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive offer greater opportunity that BlackRock may not serve;  clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that it may not manage;  clients to rebalance assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees; and  an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill.
The occurrence of any of these events could result in lower investment advisory, administration and performance fees or earnings and cause our stock price to decline.
28 Table of Contents Item1A.
RISK FACTORS (continued) Poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues and earnings.
The Companys management believes that investment performance, including the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products, is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of AUM. Poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks or to competitors could reduce revenues and cause earnings to decline as a result of:  existing clients withdrawing funds in favor of better performing products, which could result in lower investment advisory and administration fees;  the diminishing ability to attract funds from existing and new clients;  the Company earning minimal or no performance fees; and  an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill.
The determination to provide support to particular products from time to time may reduce earnings or other investments in the business.
BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time support investment products through capital or credit support. See, for example, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources. Such support utilizes capital that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. Losses on such support, or failure to have or devote sufficient capital to support products, could have an adverse impact on revenues and earnings.
Changes in the value levels of the capital markets or other asset classes could lead to a decline in the value of investments that BlackRock owns.
At December31, 2010, BlackRocks net economic investment exposure of approximately $1.0 billion in these investments (see Item7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk) is primarily the result of co-investments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds. A decline in the prices of stocks or bonds, or the value of real estate or other alternative investments within or outside the United States could lower the value of these investments and result in a decline of non-operating income and an increase in the volatility of our earnings.
Continued capital losses on investments could have adverse income tax consequences.
The Company may generate realized and unrealized capital losses on seed investments and co-investments. Realized capital losses may be carried back three years and carried forward five years and offset against realized capital gains for federal income tax purposes. The Company has unrealized capital losses for which a deferred tax asset has been established. In the event such unrealized losses are realized, the Company may not be able to offset such losses within the carryback or carryforward period or from future realized capital gains, in which case the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The failure to utilize the deferred tax asset could materially increase BlackRocks income tax expense.
The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect BlackRock.
Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. BlackRock, and the products and accounts that it manages, have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose BlackRock or the funds and accounts that it manages to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely impact BlackRocks revenues and earnings.
29 Table of Contents Item1A.
RISK FACTORS (continued) The failure or negative performance of productsof other financial institutions could lead to reduced AUM in similar productsof BlackRock without regard to the performance of BlackRocks products.
The failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to a loss of confidence in similar productsof BlackRock without regard to the performance of BlackRocks products. Such a negative contagion could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products and have a material adverse impact on our AUM, revenues and earnings.
Loss of employees could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues.
The ability to attract and retain quality personnel has contributed significantly to BlackRocks growth and success and is important to attracting and retaining clients. The market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, financial advisers and other professionals is competitive. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain required personnel. Loss of personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
BlackRocks investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors.
Separate account and commingled trust clients may terminate their investment management contracts with BlackRock or withdraw funds on short notice. The Company has, from time to time, lost separate accounts and could, in the future, lose accounts or significant AUM under various circumstances such as adverse market conditions or poor performance.
Additionally, BlackRock manages its U.S. mutual funds, closed-end funds and exchanged-traded funds under management contracts with the funds that must be renewed and approved by the funds boards of directors annually. A majority of the directors of each such fund are independent from BlackRock. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the board of directors of each fund managed by the Company will approve the funds management contract each year, or will not condition its approval on the terms of the management contract being revised in a way that is adverse to the Company .
Further, the governing agreements of many of the Companys private investment funds generally provide that, subject to certain conditions, investors in those funds, and in some cases independent directors of those funds, may remove the investment adviser, general partner or the equivalent of the fund or liquidate the fund without cause by a simple majority vote, resulting in a reduction in the management or performance fees as well as the total carried interest BlackRock could earn.
Failure to comply with client contractual requirements and/or guidelines could result in damage awards against BlackRock and loss of revenues due to client terminations.
When clients retain BlackRock to manage assets or provide products or services on their behalf, they specify guidelines or contractual requirements that the Company is required to observe in the provision of its services. A failure to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in damage to BlackRocks reputation or in its clients seeking to recover losses, withdrawing their AUM or terminating their contracts, any of which could cause the Companys revenues and earnings to decline.
Competitive fee pressures could reduce revenues and profit margins.
The investment management industry, including the offering of exchange-traded funds, is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. To the extent that the Company is forced to compete on the basis of price, it may not be able to maintain its current fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or future new business could cause revenues and profit margins to decline.
30 Table of Contents Item1A.
RISK FACTORS (continued) Performance fees may increase revenue and earnings volatility.
A portion of the Companys revenues is derived from performance fees on investment and risk management advisory assignments. Performance fees represented $540 million, or 6%, of total revenue for the year ended December31, 2010. In most cases, performance fees are based on relative or absolute investment returns, although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards. Generally, the Company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, performance fees for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the Company may not earn performance fees in future periods. Performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns and the timing of revenue recognition, causing earnings to be more volatile.
Additional acquisitions may decrease earnings and harm the Companys competitive position.
BlackRock employs a variety of strategies intended to enhance earnings and expand product offerings in order to improve profit margins. These strategies have included smaller-sized lift-outs of investment teams and acquisitions of investment management businesses, such as the MLIM, Quellos and BGI Transactions. These strategies may not be effective, and failure to successfully develop and implement these strategies may decrease earnings and harm the Companys competitive position in the investment management industry. In the event BlackRock pursues additional acquisitions, it may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at acceptable prices, and it may not be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from such acquisitions.
Risks Related to BlackRocks Operations Failure to maintain adequate infrastructure could impede BlackRocks productivity and growth.
The Companys infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers, and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. The failure to maintain an adequate infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of its business, including any expansion, could impede the Companys productivity and growth, which could cause the Companys earnings or stock price to decline.
Failure to maintain adequate business continuity plans could have a material adverse impact on BlackRock and its products.
A significant portion of BlackRocks critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas, including San Francisco, California, New York, New York and London, England. A major earthquake, fire, terrorist or other catastrophic event could result in disruption to the business. The failure of the Company to maintain updated adequate business continuity plans, including backup facilities, could impede the Companys ability to operate upon a disruption, which could cause the Companys earnings or stock price to decline.
Operating in international markets increases BlackRocks operational, regulatory and other risks.
As a result of BlackRocks extensive international business activities, the Company faces increased operational, regulatory, reputational and foreign exchange rate risks. The failure of the Companys systems of internal control to properly mitigate such additional risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support such international activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions, which could cause the Companys earnings or stock price to decline.
31 Table of Contents Item1A.
RISK FACTORS (continued) Failure to maintain a technological advantage could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in revenues.
A key element to BlackRocks continued success is the ability to maintain a technological advantage in providing the sophisticated risk analytics incorporated into BlackRocks Aladdin technology platform that support investment advisory and BlackRock Solutions clients. Moreover, the Companys technological and software advantage is dependent on a number of third parties who provide various types of data. The failure of these third parties to provide such data or software could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact BlackRocks ability to provide services to its investment advisory and BlackRock Solutions clients. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain this technological advantage or be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in these systems and processes.
Failure to implement effective information security policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that could result in a decrease in BlackRocks earnings or stock price.
BlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of its information security policies, procedures and capabilities to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them. An externally caused information security incident, such as a hacker attack, virus or worm, or an internally caused issue, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential information and could result in material financial loss, regulatory actions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, could cause a decline in the Companys earnings or stock price.
The failure of a key vendor to BlackRock to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock and its products.
BlackRock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration, custody and transfer agent roles and other operational needs. The failure or inability of BlackRock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendors to fulfill their obligations could lead to operational issues for the company and in certain products, which could result in financial losses for the Company and its clients.
The remaining integration of the BGI business creates risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect profitability.
A portion of the BGI business and personnel remain in the process of being integrated with BlackRocks previously existing business and personnel. These transition activities are complex and the Company may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs including:  the diversion of managements attention to integration matters;  difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;  difficulties in the assimilation of employees; and  challenges in keeping existing clients and obtaining new clients, including potential conflicts of interest and client imposed concentration limits on the use of an investment manager; and As a result, the Company may not be able to realize all of the benefits that it hoped to achieve from the transaction. In addition, BlackRock may be required to spend additional time or money on integration that would otherwise be spent on the development and expansion of its business and services.
32 Table of Contents Item1A.
RISK FACTORS (continued) Failure to manage risks in operating BlackRocks securities lending program for clients could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in revenues and liquidity.
The size of BlackRocks securities lending programs increased significantly with the completion of the BGI Transaction. As part of these programs, BlackRock must manage risks associated with (i)ensuring that the value of the collateral held against the securities on loan does not decline in value or become illiquid and that its nature and value complies with regulatory requirements and investment requirements, (ii)the potential that a borrower defaults or does not return a loaned security on a timely basis, (iii)the potential that the collateral held may not be sufficient to repurchase the loaned security, and (iv)errors in the settlement of securities, daily mark-to-market valuations and collateral collection. The failure of the Companys controls to mitigate these risks could result in financial losses for our clients that participate in our securities lending programs as well as for the Company.
Risks Related to Relationships with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC, Barclays and Other Institutional Investors Merrill Lynch is an important distributor of BlackRocks products, and the Company is therefore subject to risks associated with the business of Merrill Lynch.
Under a global distribution agreement entered into with Merrill Lynch, Merrill Lynch provides distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock investment management products and services through its various distribution channels. The Company may not be successful in distributing products through Merrill Lynch or in distributing its products and services through other third party distributors. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it experiences an increase in distribution-related costs, BlackRocks business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.
Loss of market share within Merrill Lynchs Global Wealth& Investment Management business could harm operating results.
A significant portion of BlackRocks revenue has historically come from AUM generated by Merrill Lynchs Global Wealth& Investment Management (GWIM) business. BlackRocks ability to maintain a strong relationship within GWIM is material to the Companys future performance. If one of the Companys competitors gains significant additional market share within the GWIM retail channel at the expense of BlackRock, then BlackRocks business, results of operations or financial condition may be negatively impacted.
The failure of Barclays to fulfill its commitments, or the inadequacy of the support provided, under certain capital support agreements in favor of a number of cash management funds acquired in the BGI Transaction, could negatively impact such funds and BlackRock.
Barclays has provided capital support agreements through December 2013, or until certain criteria are met, to support certain cash management products, which were acquired by BlackRock in the BGI Transaction. The failure of Barclays to fulfill its obligations under these agreements, or the inadequacy of the support provided, could cause our clients to suffer losses and BlackRock to suffer reputational and other adverse impacts. For a discussion on the capital support agreements see Management, Discussion and Analysis  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Barclays Support of Certain Cash Funds.
33 Table of Contents Item1A.
RISK FACTORS (continued) PNC and Barclays have each agreed to vote as stockholders in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRocks Board of Directors, and certain actions will require special board approval or the prior approval of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC and Barclays.
PNC and Barclays have agreed to vote all of their voting shares in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRocks Board of Directors in accordance with the provisions of their respective stockholder agreements with BlackRock. As a consequence, if the shares held by PNC and Barclays constitute a substantial portion of the outstanding voting shares, matters submitted to a stockholder vote that require a majority or a plurality of votes for approval, including elections of directors, will have a substantial number of shares voted in accordance with the determinations of the BlackRock Board of Directors. This arrangement has the effect of concentrating a significant block of voting control over BlackRock in its Board of Directors, whether or not stockholders agree with any particular determination of the Board. At December31, 2010, PNC and Barclays owned approximately, 25.3% and 2.3%, respectively, of BlackRocks voting common stock.
A large portion of our capital stock is held by a small group of significant shareholders. Future sales of our common stock in the public market by us or our large stockholders could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
As of December31, 2010, after giving effect to the dispositions referred to in the following sentence, PNC, Barclays and Bank of America/Merrill Lynch owned 20.3%, 19.6% and 7.1% of our capital stock, respectively. We have entered into registration rights agreements with PNC, Barclays and Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, as well as the institutional investors who purchased shares of BlackRock capital stock in connection with the BGI Transaction, and, pursuant to such agreements, on November15, 2010, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and PNC sold approximately 58.7million shares of our capital stock. The registration rights agreements, which include customary piggyback registration provisions, may continue to allow the respective stockholders to cause us to file one or more registration statements for the resale of their respective shares of capital stock and cooperate in certain underwritten offerings. Sales by us or our large stockholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market pursuant to registration rights or otherwise, or the perception that these sales might occur, couldcause the market price of our common stock to decline.
Legal and Regulatory Risks BlackRock is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and internationally.
BlackRocks business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and around the world. See the discussion under the heading Business  Regulation. Violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, temporary or permanent prohibition of the engagement in certain activities, reputational harm, suspensions of personnel or revocation of their licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser or broker-dealer registrations, or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on BlackRocks reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition and cause the Companys earnings or stock price to decline.
BlackRock may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory changes in the United States and internationally.
On July21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the DFA) was signed into law in the United States. The DFA is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions in order to be implemented. The adoption of these regulations and decisions will in large measure determine the impact of the DFA on BlackRock.
The DFA and its regulations, and other new laws or regulations, or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRocks business activities, could require BlackRock to change certain business practices and could expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and tax costs) and liabilities, as well as reputational harm. Regulatory changes could also lead to business disruptions, could adversely impact the value of assets in which BlackRock has invested on behalf of clients and/or via seed or co-investments, and, to the extent the regulations strictly control the activities of financial services firms, could make it more difficult for BlackRock to conduct certain business activities or distinguish itself from competitors.
34 Table of Contents Item1A.
RISK FACTORS (continued) Failure to comply with the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act and related regulations could result in substantial harm to BlackRocks reputation and results of operations.
Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act and BlackRocks U.S. mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations and fiduciary duties on registered investment advisers, including record-keeping, operating and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act imposes similar obligations, as well as additional detailed operational requirements, on investment advisers to registered investment companies. The failure of any of BlackRocks subsidiaries to comply with the Advisers Act or the Investment Company Act could cause the SEC to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of either of these acts, including censure, termination of an investment advisers registration or prohibition to serve as adviser to SEC-registered funds, and could lead to litigation by investors in those funds or harm to the Companys reputation, any of which could cause its earnings or stock price to decline.
Failure to comply with ERISA regulations could result in penalties and cause the Companys earnings or stock price to decline.
Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to ERISA and to regulations promulgated thereunder, insofar as they act as a fiduciary under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit specified transactions involving ERISA plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions. The failure of any of the relevant subsidiaries to comply with these requirements could result in significant penalties that could reduce the Companys earnings or cause its stock price to decline.
BlackRock is subject to banking regulations that may limit its business activities.
Because the total equity ownership interest of each of Bank of America and PNC in BlackRock exceeds or until recently exceeded certain thresholds, BlackRock is deemed to be a non-bank subsidiary of each of Bank of America and PNC, which are both financial holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. As a non-bank subsidiary of each of Bank of America and PNC, BlackRock is subject to banking regulation, including the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve. Such banking regulation limits the activities and the types of businesses that BlackRock may conduct. The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over BlackRock, including the power to prohibit BlackRock from conducting any activity that, in the Federal Reserves opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting BlackRocks business, and to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations. Any failure of either Bank of America or PNC to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain BlackRock activities and its growth. In addition, BlackRocks trust bank subsidiary is subject to regulation by the OCC, which is similar in many respects to that imposed under the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act as described above and to capital requirements established by the OCC. The OCC has broad enforcement authority over BlackRocks trust bank subsidiary. Being subject to banking regulation may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because most of its competitors are not subject to these limitations.
Failure to comply with laws and regulations in the United Kingdom, other member states of the European Union, Hong Kong, Japan, Australia and other non-U.S. jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates could result in substantial harm to BlackRocks reputation and results of operations.
The Financial Services Authority (the FSA) regulates BlackRocks subsidiaries in the United Kingdom. Authorization by the FSA is required to conduct any financial services-related business in the United Kingdom under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FSAs rules govern a firms capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients and systems and controls. Breaches of these rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against the Companys U.K.-regulated subsidiaries.
35 Table of Contents Item1A.
RISK FACTORS (continued) In addition, these subsidiaries, and other European subsidiaries, branches or representative offices, must comply with the pan-European regime established by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, which regulates the provision of investment services throughout the European Economic Area, as well as the Capital Requirements Directive, which delineates regulatory capital requirements. As discussed under Business-Regulation, in the aftermath of the financial crisis the European Commission set out a detailed plan to complete the EUs financial reform, outlining a number of initiatives to be reflected in new or updated directives, regulations and recommendations. There are changes proposed by the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, to be implemented by the summer of 2013, and UCITS IV, which is required to be adopted in the national law of each EU member state by July1, 2011. There are also European Commission consultations in process regarding certain insurance wrap products (referred to in the United Kingdom as packaged retail investment products), covering pre-contractual information to be provided with respect to such products, and UCITS V, which addresses, among other items, custodial liability. In the United Kingdom, the Bribery Act 2010 was to be implemented in April 2011 but has been put on hold while the U.K. government rewrites guidance for businesses on how to comply with its provisions. When in force it is likely to impose additional procedures on the Companys U.K.-regulated subsidiaries. In addition, a retail distribution review initiated by the FSA is expected to change how investment advice is paid for in the United Kingdom for all investment products. Final retail distribution rules are expected in early 2011, with implementation to occur by the end of 2012.
In Japan, certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (the FIEL) and the Law Concerning Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the JFSA), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEL.
In Australia, BlackRocks subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (the ASIC) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. The ASIC regulates companies and financial services in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection. Failure to comply with applicable law and regulations could result in the cancellation, suspension or variation of the relevant subsidiaries licenses in Australia.
The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (the SFO) which governs the securities and futures markets and the non-bank retail leveraged foreign exchange market in Hong Kong. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (the SFC), an independent non-governmental body. The relevant subsidiaries, and certain individuals representing them, which conduct business in any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are generally required to be registered or licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC from time to time.
There are similar legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many other non-U.S. jurisdictions where BlackRocks subsidiaries conduct business or where the funds and products it manages are organized. Failure to comply with laws and regulations in any of these jurisdictions could result in substantial harm to BlackRocks reputation and results of operation.
Legal proceedings could adversely affect operating results and financial condition for a particular period.
Many aspects of BlackRocks business involve substantial risks of legal liability. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRocks activities.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Financial Highlights (continued) BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP); however, management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Certain prior period non-GAAP data has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Computations for all periods are derived from the Companys consolidated statements of income as follows: (a) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income, as adjusted, equals operating income, GAAP basis, excluding certain items deemed non-recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value, as indicated in the table below. Operating income used for operating margin measurement equals operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income used for operating margin measurement, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below.
Year ended December31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 2,998 $ 1,278 $ 1,593 Non-GAAP expense adjustments: BGI transaction/integration costs Employee compensation and benefits 25 60  General and administration 65 123  Total BGI transaction/integration costs 90 183  PNC LTIP funding obligation 58 59 59 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 10 10 10 Restructuring charges  22 38 Compensation expense related to appreciation/(depreciation) on deferred compensation plans 11 18 (38 ) Operating income, as adjusted 3,167 1,570 1,662 Closed-end fund launch costs 15 2 9 Closed-end fund launch commissions 2 1  Operating income used for operating margin measurement $ 3,184 $ 1,573 $ 1,671 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 8,612 $ 4,700 $ 5,064 Non-GAAP adjustments: Distribution and servicing costs (408 ) (477 ) (591 ) Amortization of deferred sales commissions (102 ) (100 ) (130 ) Reimbursable property management compensation   (21 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement $ 8,102 $ 4,123 $ 4,322 Operating margin, GAAP basis 34.8 % 27.2 % 31.5 % Operating margin, as adjusted 39.3 % 38.2 % 38.7 % 45 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Financial Highlights (continued) (a) (continued) Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRocks financial performance over time. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors.
Operating income, as adjusted: BGI transaction and integration costs recorded in 2010 and 2009 consist principally of certain advisory payments, compensation expense, legal fees, marketing and promotional, occupancy and consulting expenses incurred in conjunction with the BGI Transaction. Restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and 2008 consist of compensation costs, occupancy costs and professional fees. The expenses associated with restructuring and BGI transaction and integration costs have been deemed non-recurring by management and have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, to help enhance the comparability of this information to the current reporting periods. As such, management believes that operating margins exclusive of these costs are useful measures in evaluating BlackRocks operating performance for the respective periods.
The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (LTIP) that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and a Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution, a portion of which has been received, have been excluded because these charges ultimately do not impact BlackRocks book value.
Compensation expense associated with appreciation/(depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non-operating income (expense).
Operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Companys results until future periods.
Operating margin, as adjusted, allows the Company to compare performance from period-to-period by adjusting for items that may not recur, recur infrequently or may fluctuate based on market movements, such as restructuring charges, transaction and integration costs, closed-end fund launch costs, commissions paid to certain employees as compensation and fluctuations in compensation expense based on mark-to-market movements in investments held to fund certain compensation plans. The Company also uses operating margin, as adjusted, to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance to other companies. Management uses both the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the financial performance of BlackRock. The non-GAAP measure by itself may pose limitations because it does not include all of the Companys revenues and expenses.
Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties. Management believes that excluding such costs is useful to BlackRock because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted for under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. Reimbursable property management compensation represented compensation and benefits paid to personnel of Metric Property Management, Inc. (Metric), a subsidiary of BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (Realty). Prior to the transfer in 2008, these employees were retained on Metrics payroll when certain properties were acquired by Realtys clients. The related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by Realtys clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they did not bear an economic cost to BlackRock. For each of these items, BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Financial Highlights (continued) (b) Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted: Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests (NCI), as adjusted, equals non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis, less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, GAAP basis, adjusted for compensation expense associated with depreciation/(appreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans. The compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis.

As compensation expense associated with (appreciation)/depreciation on investments related to certain deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, offsets the gain/(loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes that non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks non-operating results that impact book value.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and Germany. The Company provides a wide array of products including passively and actively managed equities, fixed income, multi-asset class, cash management and alternatives and offers clients diversified access to global markets through separate accounts, collective trusts, open-end and closed-end mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, hedge funds, and funds of funds to its diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for investment funds and other non-U.S. retail products. The Companys non-U.S. investment funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income, equities and alternatives.
In the United States, the primary retail offerings include various open-end and closed-end funds, including iShares  , the global product leader in exchange-traded funds for institutional, retail and high net worth investors. There are over 475 iShares globally across equities, fixed income and commodities, which trade like common stocks on 19 exchanges worldwide. The BlackRock Global Funds, the Companys primary retail fund group offered outside the United States, are authorized for distribution in more than 35 jurisdictions worldwide. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non-U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets.
BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension plans, charities, official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranational authorities and other government entities, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third-party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes its products and services through Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, which following Bank of Americas acquisition of Merrill Lynch, runs until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three-year extension if certain conditions are met.
BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM, percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products, or, in the case of certain real estate equity clients, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts, purchases and redemptions of investment fund shares and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes.
BlackRock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimums generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. The revenue earned is shared between BlackRock and the funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed.
Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees, based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. Historically, the magnitude of performance fees in the fourth quarter generally exceeds the first three calendar quarters in a year due to the higher number of products with performance measurement periods that end on December31.

The Company also earns fees for transition management services comprised of referral fees or agency commissions from acting as an introducing broker-dealer in buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. Commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur.
Operating expenses reflect employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, amortization of deferred sales commissions, direct fund expenses, general and administration expenses and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets.
Employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, severance, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes and related benefit costs.
Distribution and servicing costs include payments made to Merrill Lynch-affiliated entities under a global distribution agreement, to PNC-affiliated entities and Barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with obtaining and retaining client investments in certain BlackRock products.
Direct fund expenses primarily consist of third party non-advisory expenses incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expenses, audit and tax services as well as other fund related expenses directly attributable to the non-advisory operations of the fund. These expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in AUM, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business.
General and administration expenses includes marketing and promotional, occupancy and office related costs, portfolio services (including clearing expenses related to transition management services), technology, professional services, communications, closed-end fund launch costs and other general and administration expenses.
Non-operating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments (excluding available-for-sale investments) and earnings on equity method investments, as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. Other comprehensive income includes changes in valuations related to available-for-sale investments. BlackRock primarily holds investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, distressed credit/mortgage debt securities, hedge funds and real estate. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans, or for regulatory purposes, including Federal Reserve Bank stock. BlackRock does not engage in proprietary trading or other investment activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients.
In addition, non-operating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds and consolidated collateralized loan obligations. The portion of non-operating income (expense) not attributable to BlackRock is allocated to non-controlling interests on the consolidated statements of income.

AUM increased approximately $215 billion, or 6%, to $3.561 trillion at December31, 2010, compared to $3.346 trillion at December31, 2009. The growth in AUM was primarily attributable to $267 billion in net market appreciation, $131 billion of net subscriptions in long-term mandates and $17 billion increase due to foreign exchange movements, partially offset by $127 billion of BGI merger-related outflows (due to manager concentration considerations and active equity quantitative performance) and acquisition adjustments, $61 billion of net outflows in cash management products and $12 billion of net client distributions in advisory assignments.
Net market appreciation of $267 billion included $191 billion of net appreciation in equity products due to an increase in global equity markets, $55 billion in fixed income products due to current income and changes in interest rate spreads, $14 billion in multi-asset class products, and $7 billion in alternatives, primarily due to appreciation in precious metals, including silver and gold.
The $17 billion net increase in AUM from converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and pound sterling.

Business Outlook The Company began 2011 with a substantially increased AUM base as compared with 2010 average AUM as a result of strong markets in second half of 2010 and 2010 organic growth in long-term products. BlackRock believes we are in an environment of economic growth and believes that equities in the United States could post double digit returns in 2011 for the third straight year. BlackRock will continue to actively monitor global corporate earnings growth, bank lending policies, changes in the labor markets, inflation expectations, and monetary policies.
The Company offers a broad range of equity, fixed income and alternative products which are designed to track various indices and products that target returns in excess of specified benchmarks or absolute returns. BlackRocks broad set of product offerings and risk skills and tools allow us to work with clients to meet their investment objectives. While investing in fixed income and cash continue to be core to many clients portfolios, we are also seeing trends of re-risking into equities, implementation of barbell strategies comprised of beta, alpha and alternatives, and clients seeking investment solutions which we can help to meet by combining multi-asset class solutions with risk management.
55 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook (continued) The following items could impact the Companys results in 2011 and beyond: AUM and Flows  As investors shift their preferences between asset classes and between active and passive investment styles, the Companys broad product profile should enable it to retain and capture revenue as it has a wide array of offerings in multiple asset types and product styles. As equity markets continue to improve and as clients re-risk into beta and alpha equity products, which have higher yielding fee structures, BlackRocks revenue and margin could benefit.
BlackRocks unique combination of index and active capabilities positions it well to assist companies in narrowing the gap on underfunded pension plans by implementing barbell strategies using a combination of index, alpha and alternative products. In addition, as retirement money moves away from defined benefit plans into defined contributions plans and ultimately to individuals, BlackRock is well positioned to offer individual investment options with its LifePath  target date portfolios and wide array of ETFs and other mutual fund products.
Exchange-traded funds are playing an increasingly important role in asset allocation and advisory portfolios for institutional and retail investors. The overall size of the global exchange-traded funds market is expected to continue to grow at a significant rate for several years. BlackRock has a leading market share due to its large array of products and assets under management in this market. As additional asset managers enter the marketplace to offer exchange traded funds they may offer similar products at a lower fee structures. We believe that many factors beyond pricing influence investor preferences. As a first mover in several products, many iShares products have achieved a critical mass, providing both liquidity to investors and minimizing additional costs to investors in the form of bid-ask spreads and lower discounts/premiums on the ETFs traded market prices as compared with the underlying unit net asset values. Investors also value an ETFs ability to closely track its benchmark and the information, tools and education provided by iShares .
The levels of cash management assets may continue to decline from year-end levels as we expect rates to remain low and if clients continue to re-risk their portfolios. The Companys diversified global product offerings, client service and independent advice may enable it to retain a portion of these assets.
Outflows related to manager concentration considerations as a result of the BGI Transaction, many of which were low basis point assignments, are expected to be largely behind us by the end of first quarter 2011. Outflows as a result of the historical performance of the legacy BGI active quantitative equity strategies are expected to abate as performance improves under the new leadership of the strategy.
Regulatory Reform  The regulatory environment is continuing to evolve for financial institutions as well as money market funds with the intent of the reform supported by BlackRock, to protect the industry and our clients. The specific details of regulatory reform may effect the competitive environment and may provide BlackRock with risks as well as opportunities. For example, BlackRock is continuing to explore the creation of an internal trading platform on its enterprise systems to cross trades within its AUM and potentially among other client transactions, which would result in a reduction of transaction costs and ultimately increased performance returns for our clients.
56 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook (continued) Performance fees and BRS/advisory fees  A continued return to higher market levels may enable the Companys alternative investment products with absolute return objectives to contribute additional performance fee revenue. While most of the absolute return AUM eligible for performance fees is above high water marks, certain products are still dependent upon achieving high water marks to be performance fee eligible.
The on-going aftermath of the global liquidity crunch and the associated market disruption gave rise to greater demand for our risk tools and advisory services, combining our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. In 2011, we expect to continue to see strong demand for our Aladdin operating platform and our comprehensive risk reporting from sophisticated institutional investors and governmental agencies investing in longer term risk management solutions as well as strong demand for financial market advisory services.
Future opportunities  The Company plans to continue to focus on increasing the recognition of its global brand to position itself for globalization while reinvesting in the business for future growth opportunities where the cost in the current period will precede the expected future revenue.
As BlackRock seeks to grow its alternative product offerings, BlackRock may choose to seed or co-invest in additional products to establish track records and to align with clients interests. BlackRock acts as an independent asset manager and does not engage in proprietary trading or deposit taking activities.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 , as compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 Operating Income and Operating Margin Overview GAAP Year ended December31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Amount %Change Revenue $ 8,612 $ 4,700 $ 3,912 83 % Expenses 5,614 3,422 2,192 64 % Operating income $ 2,998 $ 1,278 $ 1,720 135 % Operating margin 34.8 % 27.2 % 7.6 % 28 % Operating income Operating income totaled $3.0 billion for the year ended December31, 2010, an increase of $1.7 billion compared with operating income for the year ended December31, 2009. Operating income for the year ended December31, 2010 included the full year effect of revenue and expenses related to the December1, 2009 acquisition of BGI and $90 million of BGI integration costs as compared to $183 million of BGI transaction/integration costs for the year ended December31, 2009. The transaction/integration expenses are not part of BlackRocks on-going business and are principally comprised of compensation expense, legal fees, advisory payments, occupancy costs, marketing and promotional and consulting expenses.
The increase in operating income for the year ended December31, 2010 is attributable to the $3.9 billion increase in revenue primarily related to an increase in base and performance fees associated with the AUM acquired in the BGI Transaction and growth in long-term AUM, which included market appreciation and net new business, partially offset by a $2.2 billion net increase in operating expenses related to increases in employee compensation and benefits, general and administration expenses and direct fund expenses due to the BGI Transaction.
Operating margin The Companys operating margin was 34.8% for the year ended December31, 2010, compared with 27.2% for the year ended December31, 2009.
The increase in operating margin for year ended December31, 2010 included the positive effects of synergies related to the BGI Transaction, growth in long-term AUM driven by market appreciation, a $93 million decrease in BGI transaction/integration costs, a decline of $22 million in restructuring charges and a $17 million change in foreign currency remeasurement costs/benefits, which more than offset decreases to margin related to a $131 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to additional grants to a larger number of employees at the end of January 2010, $20 million in costs for a U.K. regulatory assessment, a $20 million expense related to a contribution to a donor-advised charitable fund, a $16 million increase in occupancy costs due to the commencement of rent for Drapers Gardens, a $14 million increase of closed-end fund launch costs/commissions and a $13 million increase in amortization of intangible assets related to the finite-lived management contracts acquired in the BGI Transaction, as well as increased investments to grow the business.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 , as compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues increased $3,464 million to $7,290 million for the year ended December31, 2010, compared to $3,826 million for the year ended December31, 2009 primarily related to fees earned on products acquired in the BGI acquisition as well as organic growth in long-term AUM due to market appreciation and net new business, which included securities lending revenue of $325 million for the year ended December31, 2010, compared to $36 million for the year ended December31, 2009.
The $3,464 million net increase in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues consisted of $1,524 million in equity iShares / Exchange-traded products, $618 million in active equity products and $368 million in institutional index equity products, $244 million in fixed income iShares / exchange-traded products, $182 million in active fixed income products and $150 million in institutional index fixed income products, $261 million in multi-asset class products and $232 million in alternatives investment products, partially offset by a $115 million decrease in cash management products, due to lower average AUM.
Performance Fees Investment advisory performance fees increased $338 million, or 167%, to $540 million for the year ended December31, 2010, as compared to $202 million for the year ended December31, 2009, primarily due to an increase in performance fees earned upon exceeding absolute investment or relative investment return thresholds on alternative multi-strategy, fixed income and equity hedge funds and separate accounts across regional/country equity strategies, fixed income and multi-asset class products.
BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue for the year ended December31, 2010 decreased $17 million, or 4%, compared with the year ended December31, 2009. The decrease in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily due to a decline in non-recurring advisory assignments, as well as the effect of a decline in advisory AUM due to distributions in portfolio liquidation assignments, which have AUM based fees, partially offset by additional Aladdin , risk management solutions and investment accounting mandates. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of advisory and portfolio structuring assignment fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments.
Distribution Fees Distribution fees of $116 million for the year ended December31, 2010 increased $16 million, as compared to $100 million for the year ended December31, 2009. The increase primarily is the result of higher AUM in certain share classes of BlackRock Funds .

Other revenue of $206 million for the year ended December31, 2010 increased $111 million, or 117%, compared with $95 million for the year ended December31, 2009. The increase in other revenue was primarily the result of a $52 million increase in fees, which excludes related portfolio service costs, earned for transition management services due to an increase in transactions to execute transitions of equity and fixed income mandates, a $25 million increase in marketing fees earned from Barclays for services to distribute Barclays iPath products, $12 million increase for custody fees earned on LifePath products (a portion of which is paid to a third party sub-custodian and reflected within direct fund expenses), a $7 million increase in BlackRocks share of underlying earnings from certain operating advisory company investments and a $7 million increase in commissions revenue as a result of unit trust and open-end mutual fund class A sales commissions.

Excluding certain items deemed non-recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not affect the Companys book value, total expenses, as adjusted, increased $2,315 million, or 74%. The increase in total expenses, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to the BGI Transaction including increases in employee compensation and benefits, general and administration expenses and direct fund expenses, partially offset by a reduction of distribution and servicing costs.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 , as compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Expenses (continued) Employee Compensation and Benefits Year ended December31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Amount %Change Employee compensation and benefits, GAAP $ 3,097 $ 1,802 $ 1,295 72 % Less non-GAAP expense adjustments: BGI transaction/integration costs 25 60 (35 ) (58 %) PNC LTIP funding obligation 58 59 (1 ) (2 %) Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 10 10   % Compensation expense related to appreciation/ (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans 11 18 (7 ) (39 %) Total non-GAAP expense adjustments 104 147 (43 ) (29 %) Employee compensation and benefits, as adjusted $ 2,993 $ 1,655 $ 1,338 81 % Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $1,295 million, or 72%, to $3,097 million, for the year ended December31, 2010, compared to $1,802 million for the year ended December31, 2009.
Employee compensation and benefits, as adjusted, increased by $1,338 million after excluding the decrease of $43 million of non-GAAP adjustments primarily related to a decrease in BGI integration costs. The $1,338 million increase in employee compensation and benefits expense for the year ended December31, 2010 was attributable to a $721 million increase in incentive compensation and a $617 million increase in salaries, benefits, payroll taxes, temporary help and commissions. The increase in incentive compensation is primarily associated with the increase in operating income after excluding the BGI integration costs, a $132 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to the effect of additional grants to a larger number of employees at the end of January 2010, offset by an $8 million decrease in other deferred compensation. The $617 million increase in salaries, benefits and payroll taxes reflects an increase in the number of employees primarily resulting from the BGI Transaction as well as growth in number of employees subsequent to the BGI Transaction. Employees at December31, 2010 totaled approximately 9,100 as compared to approximately 8,600 at December31, 2009.
Distribution and Servicing Costs Distribution and servicing costs decreased $69 million to $408 million for the year ended December31, 2010, compared to $477 million for the year ended December31, 2009. These costs include payments to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, PNC and Barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $69 million decrease primarily related to lower levels of distribution payments due to lower levels of average cash management AUM and a decrease of costs due to an increase in advisory fee waivers for certain cash management funds serviced by Merrill Lynch.
Distribution and servicing costs for the year ended December31, 2010 included $246 million of costs attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and affiliates, and $10 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $349 million and $19 million, respectively, in the year ended December31, 2009. Distribution and servicing costs related to other third parties, including Barclays, increased $43 million to $152 million for the year ended December31, 2010, as compared to $109 million for the year ended December31, 2009 due to an expansion of distribution platforms and higher long-term AUM.
Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased $2 million to $102 million for the year ended December31, 2010, as compared to $100 million for the year ended December31, 2009. The increase in amortization of deferred sales commissions was primarily the result of higher sales and redemptions in certain share classes of U.S. open-end mutual funds.

The transaction and integration expenses are not part of the on-going business and are principally comprised of advisory fees, compensation expense, legal fees and consulting expenses.
Operating income for the year ended December31, 2009 included the effect of a $431 million decrease in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, associated with a market driven reduction in average AUM for all asset classes for the year ended December31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December31, 2008, and a $42 million reduction in distribution fees and other revenue, offset by an $84 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue, a $25 million increase in performance fees revenue and a $49 million net decrease in operating expenses primarily due to declines in employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, amortization of deferred sales commissions and restructuring expenses, offset by increases in direct fund expenses and general and administration expenses.

Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,570 million for the year ended December31, 2009, which was a decrease of $92 million compared to the year ended December31, 2008. The decline of operating income, as adjusted, for the year ended December31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December31, 2008 is related to the effect of the $364 million decrease in total revenue offset by a $272 million decrease in operating expenses due to decreases in employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs and general and administration expenses.
Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.2% and 38.7% for the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The reduction in margin includes the effect of the $61 million increase in expenses related to the change in foreign currency remeasurement offset by a reduction of certain expenses as a result of additional cost controls in 2009.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2008 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue for the year ended December31, 2009 included approximately $278 million of fees related to the BGI acquisition. The decrease in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues of $431 million for the year ended December31, 2009, compared with the year ended December31, 2008 consisted of decreases of $357 million in active equity products, $40 million in multi-asset class products, $141 million in alternative investment products, $7 million in active fixed income products and $83 million in cash management products primarily associated with a market driven reduction in average AUM for equity, multi-asset class and alternative products and net redemptions in cash management products. The decrease was offset by a $136 million increase in equity iShares / Exchange-traded products, a $28 million increase in institutional index equity products, a $19 million increase in fixed income iShares / Exchange-traded products and a $14 million increase in institutional index fixed income products, primarily related to products acquired in the BGI acquisition.
Performance Fees Investment advisory performance fees increased $25 million, or 14%, to $202 million for the year ended December31, 2009, as compared to $177 million for the year ended December31, 2008, primarily due to an increase in performance fees in alternative equity hedge funds, fixed income and multi-asset class separate accounts, offset by a decrease in international equity separate accounts. The year ended December31, 2009 included $24 million of performance fees related to products acquired in the BGI acquisition.
BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue for the year ended December31, 2009 increased $84 million, or 21%, compared with the year ended December31, 2008. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory assignments during the period, as well as additional Aladdin and risk management mandates. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of advisory and portfolio structuring assignment fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments.
Distribution Fees Distribution fees decreased $39 million to $100 million for the year ended December31, 2009, as compared to $139 million for the year ended December31, 2008. The decrease in distribution fees was primarily the result of lower sales, redemptions and AUM in certain share classes of open-end mutual funds.

The decrease in other revenue was primarily the result of a $31 million decline in property management fees primarily related to the outsourcing in the fourth quarter of 2008 of Metric contracts with BlackRock real estate clients, partially offset by a $14 million increase in BlackRocks share of underlying earnings from certain operating advisory company investments and a $9 million increase in fees earned for transition management services.

Excluding certain items deemed non-recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not affect the Companys book value, total expenses, as adjusted, decreased $272 million, or 8%.

Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $13 million, or 1%, to $1,802 million, for the year ended December31, 2009, compared to $1,815 million for the year ended December31, 2008. Employee compensation and benefits expense for the year ended December31, 2009 included $89 million of incremental expense related to an increase in the number of employees related to BGI.
The decrease in employee compensation and benefits expense was attributable to a $118 million decrease in salaries, benefits and commissions, a $12 million decrease in incentive compensation associated with lower operating income, partially offset by a $60 million increase related to the BGI integration costs and a $57 million increase in deferred compensation, which is offset primarily by an increase in non-operating income related to appreciation on assets associated with certain deferred compensation plans. The $118 million decrease in salaries, benefits and commissions is due to lower employment levels as a result of the Companys cost control efforts and outsourcing of Metric services, partially offset by a one month impact of the increase in employees related to the BGI Transaction. Employees at December31, 2009 totaled approximately 8,600 as compared to approximately 5,300 at December31, 2008.
Distribution and Servicing Costs Distribution and servicing costs decreased $114 million to $477 million for the year ended December31, 2009, compared to $591 million for the year ended December31, 2008. These costs include payments to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $114 million decrease primarily related to lower levels of average AUM serviced by related parties across all asset classes and an increase in waivers within certain cash management funds, resulting in lower distribution payments.
Distribution and servicing costs for the year ended December31, 2009 included $349 million of costs attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $19 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $464 million and $30 million, respectively, in the year ended December31, 2008. Distribution and servicing costs related to other third parties increased $12 million to $109 million for the year ended December31, 2009, as compared to $97 million for the year ended December31, 2008 due to an expansion of distribution platforms.
Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased $30 million to $100 million for the year ended December31, 2009, as compared to $130 million for the year ended December31, 2008. The decrease in amortization of deferred sales commissions was primarily the result of lower sales and redemptions in certain share classes of U.S. open-end mutual funds.

Management reviews its as adjusted balance sheet, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the reasons described below. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measure in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet to enable investors to eliminate gross presentation of certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities and ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders equity (excluding appropriated retained earnings related to consolidated CLOs) or cash flows. The recognition of the as adjusted assets and liabilities generally result in net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock, Inc.

See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2010.
Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable at December31, 2010 increased $377 million from December31, 2009, resulting from increase in base fees related to AUM growth and higher performance fees.

89 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Balance Sheet Overview (continued) Investments (continued) The Company further presents the total net economic investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another gauge for investors as the economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is substantially offset by a change in compensation expense and the impact of hedged investments is substantially mitigated by total return swap hedges. Carried interest is excluded as generally there is no impact to BlackRocks stockholders equity as the balance fluctuates. Finally, the Companys regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock which is not subject to market or interest rate risk is excluded from the Companys net economic investment exposure.

Total net economic investments at December31, 2010 increased $559 million from December31, 2009, resulting from changes in the investment portfolio due to purchases (including $315 million of Federal Reserve Bank stock), sales, maturities and distributions as well as market valuations and earnings from equity method investments.
BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investments that are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore consolidated even though BlackRock may not own the majority of any such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

In accordance with GAAP, certain equity method investees do not account for both their financial assets and financial liabilities under fair value measures, therefore, the Companys investment in such equity method investees may not represent fair value.
(2) Consists of net assets attributable to non-controlling investors of consolidated non-VIE sponsored investment funds.
(3) Includes BlackRocks portion of cash and cash equivalents, other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and other liabilities that are consolidated from non-VIE sponsored investment funds.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and intangible assets at December31, 2010 decreased $29 million from December31, 2009, resulting from $160 million amortization expense related to finite-lived intangibles and a decline in goodwill related to tax benefits realized from tax-deductible goodwill in excess of book goodwill from the Quellos Transaction, partially offset by $136 million related to the release of common shares held in escrow in connection with the Quellos Transaction, and increases in intangibles and goodwill from the purchases of Primasia Investment Trust Co., LTD. and Helix Financial Group LLC.
Other Assets Other assets at December31, 2010 decreased $379 million from December31, 2009, resulting from decreases in current taxes receivable, sales of held for sale assets, deferred sales commissions due to redemptions in certain share classes of U.S. open-end mutual funds and receivables from related parties.
Accrued Compensation and Benefits Accrued compensation and benefits at December31, 2010 increased $38 million from December31, 2009, primarily related to an increase in 2010 incentive compensation offset by the effect of cash payments related to 2009 year end incentive compensation and other compensation accruals assumed in the BGI Transaction.
Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December31, 2010 increased $228 million from December31, 2009, resulting from increases in unit trust payable, retrocessions, current taxes payable and other accruals payable to Merrill Lynch.
Borrowings Borrowings at December31, 2010 decreased $2,309 million from December31, 2009, resulting from repayments of short-term borrowings and convertible debt of $2,134 million and $176 million, respectively.
91 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Balance Sheet Overview (continued) Deferred Income Tax Liabilities Deferred tax liabilities at December31, 2010 decreased $94 million from December31, 2009, primarily related to intangible assets. The decrease included revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to the 2010 tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom.
Other Liabilities Other liabilities at December31, 2010 decreased $356 million from December31, 2009, primarily resulting from a decrease related to repayments to Barclays of approximately $320 million to settle certain non-interest bearing notes assumed in the BGI Transaction and settlement of liabilities related to the sales of held for sale assets, partially offset by increases in various other liabilities.
Stockholders Equity Total stockholders equity at December31, 2010 increased $1,765 from December31, 2009, principally resulting from $2,063 million of net income attributable to BlackRock, $445 million of stock-based compensation expense, $136 million related to the release of common shares held in escrow in connection with the Quellos Transaction, $44 million excess tax benefits from vested stock-based compensation and a $10 million Merrill Lynch cash capital contribution in 2010, partially offset by $776 million of payments for cash dividends, $109 million of net issuances of common shares related to employee stock transactions and $140 million of stock repurchases under the repurchase plan approved in July 2010.
Liquidity and Capital Resources BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds and VIEs In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) are consolidated into the financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority interest, if any, in these funds or CLOs. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for its cash flow presented in accordance with GAAP.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds and VIEs (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, other revenue and distribution fees.

Net cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, for the year ended December31, 2010 primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Net cash inflows for the year ended December31, 2010 included the effect of cash payments related to 2009 incentive compensation, including the payments for BGI employee compensation accruals assumed in the BGI Transaction and repayments to Barclays of approximately $320 million to settle certain non-interest bearing notes assumed in the BGI Transaction.
Investing Activities Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, for the year ended December31, 2010 were $575 million and primarily included $656 million of purchases of investments, including $315 million of Federal Reserve Bank stock, $131 million of purchases of property and equipment, and $23 million of acquisition related payments, partially offset by $181 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and $53 million of return of capital from equity method investees.

(4) A portion of the required regulatory capital is partially met with cash and cash equivalents.
The $798 million increase in total liquidity during the year ended December31, 2010 included the effects on liquidity of the following: positive operating cash flows which were partially offset by (i)cash payments of 2009 year end incentive awards, including the payments for BGI employee compensation accrual assumed in the BGI Transaction, (ii)the purchase of $315 million of Federal Reserve Bank stock, (iii)the settlement of approximately $320 million of certain non-interest bearing notes assumed in the BGI Transaction and (iv)$176 million of repayments related to convertible debt.
A significant portion of the Companys $1,403 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash.
Short-term Borrowings: The following describes the Companys short-term borrowing arrangements, which the Company has access to utilize.
2007 Credit Facility In August 2007, the Company entered into a five-year, $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility) to provide back-up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and to fund investment opportunities. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December31, 2010. At December31, 2010, the Company had $100 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.47% and a maturity date of February28, 2011. The Company had a daily average of $100 million outstanding during the fourth quarter 2010 and a daily average of $115 million outstanding for the full year 2010.
Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. Bank of America, a related party prior to November 2010, has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short-term Borrowings (continued) Commercial Paper Program On October14, 2009, BlackRock established a commercial paper program (the CP Program) under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the CP Notes) on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3 billion. The initial proceeds of the commercial paper issuances were used to finance a portion of the BGI Transaction. Subsidiaries of Bank of America and Barclays, as well as other third parties, act as dealers under the CP Program. At December31, 2010 the CP Program was supported by the 2007 facility.
The Company began to issue CP Notes under the CP Program on November4, 2009. As of December31, 2010, BlackRock did not have any outstanding CP Notes.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Barclays Support of Certain Cash Funds Barclays has provided capital support agreements to support certain cash management products acquired by BlackRock in the BGI Transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the capital support agreements, Barclays agreed to cover losses on covered securities within the products in the aggregate of up to $2.2 billion from December1, 2009 through December1, 2013 or until certain criteria are met. BlackRock and Barclays have procedures in place to determine loss events on covered securities within the products and to ensure support payments from Barclays. At December31, 2010, Barclays remaining maximum potential obligation in the aggregate under the capital support agreements was $1.7 billion. At December31, 2010, BlackRock concluded that although these funds were variable interest entities, it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds.
Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalents in those jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
BTC is chartered as a national bank that does not accept client deposits and whose powers are limited to trust activities.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2035. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
In January 2010, the Company entered into an agreement with Mourant& Co Trustees Limited and Mourant Property Trustees Limited as Trustees of the Drapers Gardens Unit Trust, for the lease of approximately 292,418 square feet of office and ancillary (including retail) space located at Drapers Gardens, 12 Throgmorton Avenue, London, EC2, United Kingdom.The lease began on February17, 2010 (the Effective Date) and will continue for 25 years, with the option to renew for an additional five-year term. The lease provides for total annual base rental payments of approximately $22 million, which is subject to increase on each fifth anniversary of the beginning of the lease. The lease included an initial rent free period for 36 months and 22 days following the Effective Date.
Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts, which are either non-cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December31, 2010, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data, office related services and third party marketing and promotional services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December31, 2010.
In connection with the Drapers Gardens lease described above, the Company entered into a purchase obligation for construction services of approximately $67 million. The Company incurred $4million of construction services during the year ended December31, 2010. Substantially all of the remaining obligation of $63million is expected to be incurred during 2011.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment/Loan Commitments At December31, 2010, the Company had $183 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds, including funds of private equity funds, real estate funds and distressed credit funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third party funds as third party non-controlling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment and are therefore presented in 2011. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
Prior to March31, 2010, the Company was committed to provide financing of up to $60 million to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that was managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock.The financing is collateralized bya pledge by Anthracite of its ownership interest in a real estate debt investment fund, which is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock.At December31, 2010, $33.5 million of financing was outstanding and remains outstanding as of February 2011, which is past its final maturity date of March5, 2010. At December31, 2010, the carrying value of the collateral was estimated to be zero, which resulted in an additional $12.5 million reduction in amounts due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition and an equal amount recorded in general and administrative expenses on the Companys consolidated statements of income for the year ended December31, 2010.The Company has no obligation to loan additional amounts to Anthracite under this facility.Anthracite filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York on March15, 2010.Recovery of any amount of the financing provided by the Company in excess of the value of the collateral is not anticipated. The Company continues to evaluate the collectability of the outstanding borrowings.
Carried Interest Claw-back As a general partner in certain investment funds, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive certain carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. At December31, 2010, the Company has received less than $10 million in cash that was not recorded as revenue and is subject to claw-back.
Contingent Distribution Obligations In November 2010, BlackRock entered into a second amended and restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch, which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in certain BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three-year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimated payments for 2011, which due to uncertainty of asset levels and future additional sales, has been held constant for 2011 through 2013.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos was entitled to receive two contingent payments, subject to achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock.
During second quarter 2009, the Company determined the amount of the first contingent payment to be $219 million, of which $11 million was previously paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $208 million, during second quarter 2009, $156 million was paid in cash and $52 million was paid in common stock, or approximately 330,000 shares based on a price of $157.33 per share.
The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, would have been payable in cash in 2011. Quellos also was entitled to a catch-up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures were met through 2010 as the value of the first contingent payment was less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, would have been paid to Quellos based on factors including the continued employment of certain employees with BlackRock.
The base and performance fee measures through December31, 2010 were not achieved, therefore, the remaining contingent payments will not occur.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 15, Stock-Based Compensation, and 16, Employee Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December31, 2010 totaled $1,520 million and included incentive compensation of $1,220 million, deferred compensation of $89 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $211 million. Substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2011, while the deferred compensation obligations are payable over periods up to five years.
Separate Account Liabilities The Companys two wholly-owned registered life insurance companies in the United Kingdom maintain separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owners and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December31, 2010, the Company had $121.1 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the BGI, MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December31, 2010. See further discussion in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.
103 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies as well as recent accounting developments see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.
Consolidation of Sponsored Investment Funds and Securitization Products Consolidation of sponsored investment funds and securitization products (collectively investment products) is determined pursuant to ASC 810, Consolidation . The accounting method used by the Company is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee, the investment product. To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investment product, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investment product is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements.
For investment products in which BlackRocks voting interest is less than 50%, an analysis is performed to determine if the investment product is a variable interest entity (VIE) or a voting rights entity. Upon the determination that the investment product is a VIE further analysis, as discussed below, is performed to determine if BlackRock is the primary beneficiary (PB) of the investment product, which would result in consolidation.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities Pursuant to ASC 810-10, certain investment products for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests may be deemed VIEs. BlackRock reviews factors, including the rights of the equity holders and obligations of equity holders to absorb losses or receive expected residual returns to determine if the investment product is a VIE. BlackRock is required to consolidate a VIE when it is deemed to be the PB, which is evaluated continuously as facts and circumstances change.
In June 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-17, Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities (ASU 2009-17), which became effective for BlackRock on January1, 2010. In February 2010 the FASB issued ASU 2010-10, Amendments to Statement 167 for Certain Investment Funds (ASU 2010-10) .
This ASU deferred the application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No.46(R), to a reporting enterprises interest in VIEs if certain conditions are met.
The PB of a VIE that is an investment fund meeting the conditions of ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that absorbs the majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests (including those of related parties). Effective January1, 2010, the PB of a VIE that does not meet the conditions for deferral in ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE.
104 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (continued) Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. If the Company, together with its related parties, is determined to be the PB of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the PB of a VIE for entities that do meet the conditions of ASU 2010-10, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes.
In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles, including collateralized debt/loan obligations (CDOs or CLOs) that do not meet the conditions of ASU 2010-10 and sponsored investment funds, which may be considered VIEs. At December31, 2010, the Company consolidated four VIEs, including three CLOs and one sponsored private equity fund. At December31, 2010, the following balances related to these four VIEs were consolidated on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition: (Dollar amounts in millions) CLOs Sponsored Private EquityFund Total Consolidated VIEs Assets of consolidated VIEs: Cash and cash equivalents $ 82 $ 11 $ 93 Bank loans, bonds and other investments 1,278 34 1,312 Liabilities of consolidated VIEs: Borrowings (1,278 )  (1,278 ) Other liabilities (7 )  (7 ) Appropriated retained earnings (75 )  (75 ) Non-controlling interests of consolidated VIEs  (45 ) (45 ) Total net interests in consolidated VIEs $  $  $  As of December31, 2010, BlackRock was the manager of over 20 CLOs/CDOs and other securitization entities, including the three aforementioned CLOs in which BlackRock, in accordance with ASU 2009-17, was determined to be the PB, which resulted in consolidation of these VIEs in the Companys consolidated financial statements. BlackRock was deemed to be the PB because it has the power to direct the activities of the CLO that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. At December31, 2010, the Company had $1,360 million and $1,285 million in assets and liabilities, respectively, on its consolidated statement of financial condition related to these consolidated CLOs. In addition, the Company recorded appropriated retained earnings for the difference, as the CLO noteholders, not BlackRock, ultimately will receive the benefits or absorb the losses associated with the CLOs assets and liabilities. Therefore, the changes in the assets and liabilities of these CLOs have no impact on net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc. or its cash flows.
105 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (continued) At of December31, 2010, BlackRock was determined to be the PB of one sponsored private equity investment fund of funds in which it had a non-substantive investment and was deemed to absorb the majority of the variability due to its de-facto third party relationships with other partners in the fund, which limits the ability of the partners to transfer or sell their interests without BlackRocks consent as the general partner of the fund. At December31, 2010, the Company had recorded $11 million, $34 million and $45 million in cash and cash equivalents, private equity investments and nonredeemable non-controlling interests of consolidated VIEs, respectively, on its consolidated statement of financial condition related to this VIE. The Company has no risk of loss with its involvement with this VIE. Therefore, the changes in the assets and liabilities of this VIE have no impact on net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc.
Consolidation of Voting Rights Entities To the extent that BlackRock maintains 50% or greater voting interest of an investment product, BlackRock is deemed to have control of the product, which results in consolidation of the product into BlackRocks financial statements.
The Company, as general partner or managing member of certain sponsored investment funds, generally is presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to ASC 810-20, Control of Partnerships and Similar Entities (ASC 810-20), the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non-affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have other substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Consolidation of Voting Rights Entities (continued) At December31, 2010 and 2009, as a result of consolidation of various investment products deemed to be voting rights entities, including products where BlackRock owns 50% of greater of the voting rights of the product, under the consolidation policies described above, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: (Dollar amounts in millions) December31, 2010 December31, 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 65 $ 75 Investments: Trading investments 60 103 Other investments 337 360 Other assets 3 2 Other liabilities (10 ) (9 ) Non-controlling interests (195 ) (273 ) BlackRocks net interests in consolidated investment funds $ 260 $ 258 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to ASC 810-10. At December31, 2009, the above balances included a consolidated sponsored investment fund that also was deemed a VIE at December31, 2010 and is currently reported within assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs on the consolidated statement of financial condition. This VIE, as well as three CLOs which are also VIEs, was excluded from the December31, 2010 balances above as commencing in 2010 these balances are reported separately on the consolidated statement of financial condition.
Investments Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the PB of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity.
107 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments (continued) Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non-operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be connected to BlackRocks core business.
At December31, 2010, the Company had $583 million and $58 million of equity method investments, including equity method investments held for deferred compensation, reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December31, 2009 the Company had $401 million and $36 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively.
Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statement of income.
When the fair value of an available-for-sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other-than-temporary.
In making this determination for equity securities, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statement of income.
In making this determination for debt securities, the Company considers whether: (1)the Company has the intent to sell the security, (2)it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery, or (3)the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security, but the security has suffered a credit loss, the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total impairment and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in other comprehensive income.
108 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded other-than-temporary impairments of less than $1 million, $5 million, and $8 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available-for-sale investments, which were recorded in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income.
The $5 million of impairments in 2009 included $2 million related to credit loss impairments on debt securities. The $2 million credit loss impairment in 2009 was determined by comparing the estimated discounted cash flows versus the amortized cost for each individual security. The other-than-temporary impairments related to debt securities were due to adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses.
Evaluation of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income.
Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted the applicable provisions of ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820-10), as of January1, 2008, which require, among other things, enhanced disclosures about assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value.
Hierarchy of Fair Value Inputs The provisions of ASC 820-10 establish a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities.
Assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date.
Level 1 assets may include listed mutual funds (including those accounted for under the equity method of accounting as these mutual funds are investment companies, that have publicly available NAVs which in accordance with GAAP are calculated under fair value measures and are equal to the earnings of such funds), ETFs, and listed equities and certain derivatives.
109 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) Level 2 Inputs: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; quotes from pricing services or brokers, for which the Company can determine that orderly transactions took place at the quoted price or that the inputs used to arrive at the price were observable; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies.
Level 2 assets in this category may include debt securities, bank loans, short-term floating rate notes and asset-backed securities, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain equity method limited partnership interests in hedge funds and mutual funds valued based on net asset values where the Company has the ability to redeem at the measurement date or in the near term without redemption restrictions, restricted public securities valued at a discount, as well as overthe-counter derivatives, including interest and inflation rate swaps and foreign exchange currency contracts that have inputs to the valuations that can be generally corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability, which may include non-binding broker quotes. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Certain investments that are valued using net asset values and that are subject to current redemption restrictions that will not be lifted in the near term are included in Level 3.
Level 3 assets in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, direct private equity investments held within consolidated funds and certain held for sale real estate disposal assets.
Level 3 liabilities included in this category include borrowings of consolidated collateralized loan obligations valued based upon non-binding broker quotes.
Level 3 inputs include BlackRock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments. BlackRocks $650 million of Level 3 investments at December31, 2010 primarily include co-investments in private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities and real estate equity products. Many of these investees are investment companies, which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing/valuation information, including independent appraisals from third party sources; however, in some instances current valuation information for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model-based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments.
110 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) Significance of Inputs The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument.
Pricing Services and Broker Quotes A significant amount of inputs used to value equity and debt securities are sourced from well-recognized third party pricing vendors. Generally, prices obtained from pricing vendors are categorized as Level 1 inputs for securities that are traded in active markets and as Level 2 for other securities if the vendor uses observable inputs in determining the price. Annually, BlackRock reviews both the valuation methodology, including the general assumptions and methods used to value various asset classes, and operational process with these vendors. In addition, on a quarterly basis meetings are held with the vendors to identify any significant changes to the vendors process.
In addition, quotes obtained from brokers generally are non-binding and categorized as Level 3 inputs. However, if the Company is able to determine that market participants have transacted for the asset in an orderly manner near the quoted price or if the Company can determine that the inputs used by the broker are observable, the quote is classified as a Level 2 input.
Significant Transfers Into and Out of Levels 1, 2, and 3 During the year ended December31, 2010, the Company reclassified approximately $47 million of net investments out of Level 3 predominantly to Level 2. The majority of the net reclassifications were related to investments that Company values using a NAV (or a capital account) and it currently has the ability to redeem in the near term.
Changes in Valuation Changes in value on $1,051 million of investments will impact the Companys non-operating income (expense), $45 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income, $431 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $13 million related to carried interest has no impact on non-operating income (expense). As of December31, 2010, changes in fair value of approximately $397 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will impact BlackRocks net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $260 million.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December31, 2010, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December31, 2010 Goodwill $ 12,805 Intangible assets Indefinitelived Management contracts Mutual funds/Exchange-traded products 10,661 Other collective investment funds 3,610 Alternative investment funds 917 Trade names/trademarks 1,403 License 6 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization Management contracts Institutional/Retail separate accounts 807 Alternative investment accounts and funds 104 Other 4 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 30,317 112 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts acquired in a business acquisition to manage assets in proprietary open- and closed-end investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with the applicable provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (ASC 350), indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite-lived management contracts are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December31, 2010, ranged from 3 years to 14 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 6.3 years.
Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. The impairment test performed as of July31, 2010 indicated no impairment charge was required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December31, 2010 the Companys common stock closed at $190.58, which exceeded its book value per share of approximately $136.09 after excluding appropriated retained earnings.
Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite-lived management contracts, trade names and licenses for impairment at least annually, considering various factors, including AUM growth rates, product mix, product margins, tax rates, discount rates and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each intangible asset are impaired and whether the indefinite-life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite-lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion.
In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company performed impairment tests that indicated no impairment charges were required, the classification of indefinite-lived versus finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles were required. The Company continuously monitors various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment.
113 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles (continued) In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $160 million, $147 million and $146 million for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740, Income Taxes . Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date.
BlackRock adopted the applicable provisions of ASC 740 on January1, 2007 related to uncertainties in income taxes which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on, among other things, de-recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.
The application of ASC 740 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December31, 2010, BlackRock had $307 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $194 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
114 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) In accordance with ASC 740, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. At December31, 2010, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $10 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $5,477 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. ASC 740 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.
At December31, 2010, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $108 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain equity method investments which include fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for further details.
The Company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $57 million and current income taxes payable of $157 million at December31, 2010.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions.
The Company contracts with third parties, including related parties, for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non-U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with ASC 605-45, Revenue Recognition  Principle Agent Considerations (ASC 605-45), and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $831 million, $611 million and $762 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties, which due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income.
The Company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. Such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash and securities, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. The revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. For the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, securities lending revenue totaled $325 million, $36 million and $25 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee.
The Company also may receive performance fees or incentive allocations from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts which are primarily alternative, equity or multi-asset class products. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement periods, which vary by product or account and could be monthly, quarterly, annually or longer. For the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, performance fee revenue totaled $540 million, $202 million and $177 million, respectively.
116 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) In addition, the Company may receive carried interest in the form of an investment capital allocation or cash from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. However, BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon performance of these investment products in future periods. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw-back provisions in investments or cash to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is realized upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically improbable. The Company records realized carried interest as performance fees on its consolidated statements of income. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had $23 million and $13 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The ultimate recognition of revenue, if any, for these products is unknown.
Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions , which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i)fixed fees, (ii)percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii)performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $460 million, $477 million and $393 million, respectively.
Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record performance revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically improbable.
117 Table of Contents Item7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment advisory and administration fees are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December31, 2010, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees.
Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors, depending on the circumstances, for approval.
In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments.
BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity and hedge funds. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December31, 2010, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $25 million.
118 Table of Contents Item7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks At December31, 2010, approximately $397 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Excluding the impact of the Federal Reserve Bank stock, carried interest, investments made to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans and certain equity investments that are hedged via the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December31, 2010 December31, 2009 Variance Amount %Change Total investments, GAAP $ 1,540 $ 1,049 $ 491 47 % Investments held by consolidated sponsored investment funds (397 ) (463 ) 66 14 % Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 260 258 2 1 % Total net economic investments 1,403 844 559 66 % Federal Reserve Bank stock (325 ) (10 ) (315 ) * Carried interest (13 ) (4 ) (9 ) 225 % Deferred compensation investments (76 ) (71 ) (5 ) 7 % Hedged investments (25 ) (36 ) 11 (31 %) Total net economic investment exposure $ 964 $ 723 $ 241 33 % *  Not applicable or the percentage is in excess of +/- 1,000%.
The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the equity market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Equity Market Price Risk At December31, 2010, the Companys net exposure to market price risk in its investment portfolio was approximately $544 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments, hedge funds and fund of funds, as well as mutual funds. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $54.4 million in the carrying value of such investments.
Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December31, 2010, the Company was exposed to interest-rate risk and credit spread risk as a result of approximately $420 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $7 million in the carrying value of such investments.
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the pound sterling, euro, South Korean won and Taiwan dollars, was $118 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately an $11.8 million decline in the carrying value of such investments.

Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and affected by the Companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with the authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework . Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December31, 2010, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective.
The Companys independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (continued) REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BlackRock, Inc.: We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of BlackRock, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statement of financial condition as of December31, 2010 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended of the Company and our report dated February28, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Introduction and Basis of Presentation (continued) Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and include the accounts of the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Non-controlling interests on the consolidated statements of financial condition include the portion of consolidated sponsored investment funds in which the Company does not have direct equity ownership. Significant accounts and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications Certain items previously reported have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
2. Significant Accounting Policies Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents primarily consists of cash, money market funds and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities, at date of purchase, of three months or less in which the Company is exposed to market and credit risk. Cash and cash equivalent balances that are legally restricted from use by the Company are recorded in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Cash balances maintained by consolidated sponsored investment funds are not considered legally restricted and are included in cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Effective January1, 2010, cash balances maintained by consolidated variable interest entities are included in assets of consolidated variable interest entities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
Investments Investments in Debt and Marketable Equity Securities BlackRock holds debt and marketable equity investments which, pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 320-10, Investments  Debt and Equity Securities, are classified as trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity based on the Companys intent to sell the security or, for a debt security, the Companys intent and ability to hold the debt security to maturity.
Trading securities are those investments that are purchased principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change.
F-13 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Available-for-sale securities are those securities that are not classified as trading or held-to-maturity securities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available-for-sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non-operating income (expense) on the Companys consolidated statements of income.
Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
Equity Method For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where it is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE), but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company follows the equity method of accounting in accordance with ASC 323, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures . Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss on investment funds is recorded as net gain (loss) on investments within non-operating income (expense) and as other revenue for operating advisory company investments since such companies are considered to be an extension of BlackRocks core business. The net income of the investee is recorded based upon the most current information available at the time, which may precede the date of the statement of financial condition. Distributions received from the investment reduce the Companys investment balance.
Cost Method For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non-marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received from the investment are recorded as dividend income within non-operating income (expense).
Impairments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available-for-sale and cost method of accounting investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using fair values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the discounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income.
When the fair value of available-for-sale securities is lower than its cost, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary.
In making this determination, for equity securities, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income.
F-14 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Impairments (continued) In making this determination for debt securities, the Company considers whether: (1)the Company has the intent to sell the security, (2)it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, or (3)the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security, but the security has suffered a credit loss, the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total impairment and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in other comprehensive income.
Consolidation The accounting method used for the Companys equity investments is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee, the investment product. To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements.
For investment products in which BlackRocks voting interest is less than 50%, an analysis is performed to determine if the investment product is a variable interest entity (VIE) or a voting rights entity. Upon the determination that the investment product is a VIE further analysis, as discussed below, is performed to determine if BlackRock is the primary beneficiary (PB) of the investment product, which would result in consolidation.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities Pursuant to ASC 810-10, Consolidation (ASC 810-10), certain investment products for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests, may be deemed VIEs. BlackRock reviews factors, including the rights of the equity holders and obligations of equity holders to absorb losses or receive expected residual returns to determine if the investment product is a VIE. BlackRock is required to consolidate a VIE when it is deemed to be the PB, which is evaluated continuously as facts and circumstances change.
In June 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-17, Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities (ASU 2009-17), which became effective for BlackRock on January1, 2010. In February 2010 the FASB issued ASU 2010-10, Amendments to Statement 167 for Certain Investment Funds (ASU 2010-10) .
This ASU defers the application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.167 (SFAS No.167), Amendments to FASB Interpretation No.46(R), to a reporting enterprises interest in VIEs if certain conditions are met. See Accounting Policies Adopted in the Year Ended December31, 2010 below for more information.
The PB of a VIE that does not meet the conditions of ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE.
The PB of a VIE that meets the conditions of ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests, including those of related parties) that will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses, receive a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Consolidation (continued) Consolidation of Voting Rights Entities To the extent that BlackRock maintains 50% or greater voting interest of an investment product, BlackRock is deemed to have control of the product, which results in consolidation of the product into BlackRocks financial statements.
The Company, as general partner or managing member of certain sponsored investment funds, generally is presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to ASC 810-20, Control of Partnerships and Similar Entities (ASC 810-20), the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non-affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have other substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements.
From time to time, the Company will maintain a controlling interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the underlying investments held by consolidated sponsored investment funds are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the investments fair values reflected in non-operating income (expense) on the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, the fair value for such underlying investments is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the funds net asset value. When the Company no longer controls these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another investment accounting method. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies and certain real estate products, are recorded based upon the most current information available at the time, which may precede the date of the statement of financial condition Upon consolidation of various sponsored investment funds on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition, the Company retains the specialized accounting principles of the underlying funds pursuant to ASC 810-10.
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities Two wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company in the United Kingdom are registered life insurance companies that maintain separate accounts representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts, and equal and offsetting separate account non-financial liabilities. The separate account assets are not subject to general claims of the creditors of BlackRock. These accounts and the related liabilities are recorded as separate account assets and separate account liabilities on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition in accordance with the ASC 944-80, Financial Services  Separate Accounts.
The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to separate account assets supporting individual and group pension contracts accrue directly to the contract owner and are not reported as revenue or non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. Policy administration and management fees associated with separate account products are included in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Collateral Assets Held and Liabilities Under Securities Lending Agreements The Company facilitates securities lending arrangements whereby securities held by separate account assets maintained by the life insurance companies are lent to third parties. In exchange, the Company receives collateral, principally cash and securities, with minimums generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the securities lent in order to reduce counterparty risk. Under the Companys securities lending arrangements, the Company can resell or re-pledge the collateral and the borrower can re-sell or re-pledge the loaned securities. The securities lending transactions entered into by the Company are accompanied by an agreement that entitles the Company to request the borrower to return the securities at any time; therefore these transactions are not reported as sales under ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing.
As a result of the Companys ability to resell or re-pledge the collateral, the Company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the collateral received under these arrangements (both cash and non-cash) as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. At December31, 2010 and 2009, the fair value of loaned securities held by separate account assets was approximately $16.1 billion and $18.0 billion, respectively, and the collateral held under these securities lending agreements was approximately $17.6 billion and $19.3 billion, respectively. During the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had not sold or re-pledged any of the collateral received under these arrangements.
Deferred Sales Commissions The Company holds the rights to receive certain cash flows from sponsored mutual funds sold without a front-end sales charge (back-end load shares). The carrying value of these deferred mutual fund commissions is being amortized over periods between one and six years. The Company receives distribution fees from these funds and contingent deferred sales commissions (CDSCs) upon shareholder redemption of certain back-end load shares, which are recorded within distribution fees on the consolidated statements of income. Upon receipt of CDSCs, the Company records revenue and the remaining unamortized deferred sales commission is expensed.
The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of deferred commission assets to determine whether a significant decline in the equity or bond markets or other events or circumstances indicate that an impairment in value may have occurred. If indicators of a potential impairment exist, the Company compares the carrying value of the asset to the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows related to the asset. If such assessments indicate that estimated future net undiscounted cash flows will not be sufficient to recover the recorded carrying value, the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value. No such impairments were recorded for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 or 2008.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation generally is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining lease term.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Property and Equipment (continued) Software Costs BlackRock develops a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services for internal use, utilizing proprietary software that is hosted and maintained by BlackRock. The Company follows ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software (ASC 350-40) .
ASC 350-40 requires the capitalization of certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are included within property and equipment on the consolidated statements of financial condition and are amortized beginning when the software project is complete and put into production over the estimated useful life of the software of three years.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The value of an assembled workforce is subsumed in goodwill as is it not a separable identifiable intangible asset. Intangible assets are comprised of indefinite-lived intangible assets and finite-lived intangible assets. The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open-end funds, closed-end funds and collective trust funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such contracts primarily is based upon the following: a) the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds; b) the Company expects to, and has the ability to, continue to operate these products indefinitely; c) the products have multiple investors and are not reliant on a single investor or small group of investors for their continued operation; d) current competitive factors and economic conditions do not indicate a finite life; and e) there is a high likelihood of continued renewal based on historical experience. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely.
In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (ASC 350), indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. The value of contracts for separately managed accounts and certain alternative funds which have finite lives are amortized over the expected life of the contracts.
The Company assesses its goodwill, indefinite-lived management contracts, trade names/trademarks and licenses for impairment at least annually. In its assessment of goodwill for impairment, the Company considers such factors as the book value and market capitalization of the Company. In its assessment of indefinite-lived management contracts and trade names/trademarks, the Company considers various factors including assets under management, product mix, operating margins, tax rates, discount rates and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite-life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows.
The fair value of finite-lived management contracts and their remaining useful life is reviewed at least annually to determine if circumstances exist which may indicate a potential impairment. In addition, if circumstances exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Assets and Liabilities to be Disposed of by Sale In the course of the business of establishing real estate and other alternative investment funds, the Company may purchase land, properties and other assets while incurring liabilities directly associated with the assets, together a disposal group, with the intention to sell the disposal group to sponsored investment funds upon their launch. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 360-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment, the Company treats these assets and liabilities as a disposal group, measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value. Losses are recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down to fair value and gains are recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value, but not in excess of the cumulative loss previously recognized.
During the year ended December31, 2010, the disposal group assets were sold and the liabilities were settled. At December31, 2009, the Company held disposal group assets of $46 million which were reported in other assets and related liabilities of $45 million which were reported in other liabilities on its consolidated statements of financial condition. During the year ended December31, 2009, the Company recorded a net loss of $2 million, within non-operating income (expense) on its consolidated statements of income related to the disposal group and did not record any adjustments in 2010.
Convertible Debt Instruments In accordance with the provisions within ASC 470-20, Debt (ASC 470-20), issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion should separately account for the liability and equity components in the statement of financial condition. The excess of the initial proceeds of the convertible debt instrument over the amount allocated to the liability component creates a debt discount, which is amortized as interest expense over the expected life of the liability. See Note 13, Borrowings, for further discussion on the Companys convertible debentures.
Non-controlling Interests According to the requirements within ASC 810-10, the Company reports non-controlling interests as equity, separate from the parents equity, on the consolidated statements of financial condition. In addition, the Companys consolidated net income on the consolidated statements of income includes the income/(loss) attributable to non-controlling interest holders of the Companys consolidated sponsored investment funds and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). Income/(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests are not adjusted for income taxes for consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs that are treated as pass-through entities for tax purposes.
Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities The provisions of ASC 480-10, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, require temporary equity classification for instruments that are currently redeemable or convertible for cash or other assets at the option of the holder. The Company includes redeemable non-controlling interests related to certain consolidated sponsored investment funds in temporary equity on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Appropriated Retained Earnings Upon adoption of ASU 2009-17, BlackRock consolidated three CLOs and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to appropriated retained earnings on the consolidated statement of financial condition equal to the difference between the fair value of the CLOs assets and the fair value of their liabilities. Such amounts are recorded as appropriated retained earnings as the CLO noteholders, not BlackRock, ultimately will receive the benefits or absorb the losses associated with the CLOs assets and liabilities. Subsequent to adoption of ASU 2009-17, the net change in the fair value of the CLOs assets and liabilities has been recorded as net income (loss) attributable to nonredeemable non-controlling interests and as an adjustment to appropriated retained earnings. See Accounting Policies Adopted in the Year Ended December31, 2010 below for more information.
Treasury Stock The Company records common stock purchased for treasury at cost. At the date of subsequent reissuance, the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of such stock on the average cost method.
Revenue Recognition Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of the assets under management (AUM) or, in the case of certain real estate clients, net operating income generated by the underlying properties. Investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers.
The Company contracts with third parties and related parties for various mutual fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with ASC 605-45, Revenue Recognition  Principal Agent Considerations, and has recorded its management fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $831 million, $611 million and $762 million, respectively, and were reflected net in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income.
The Company also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. Such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis. The revenue earned on the collateral is shared between the Company and funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) Performance Fees The Company receives performance fees or an incentive allocation from alternative investment products and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified relative and/or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which varies by product or account.
The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investments upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock maybe required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw-back provisions in investments, or cash to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is realized upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically improbable. The Company records realized carried interest as performance fees on its consolidated statements of income. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had $23 million and $13 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic, enterprise investment system and financial markets advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions  and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation of illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i)fixed fees, (ii)percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM and (iii)performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. The fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are recorded in BlackRock Solutions and advisory on the consolidated statements of income.
Other Revenue The Company earns fees for transition management services comprised of referral fees or agency commissions from acting as an introducing broker-dealer in buying and selling securities on behalf of the Companys customers. Commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur and are reflected in other revenue on the consolidated statements of income.
The Company earns commissions revenue upon the sale of unit trusts and ClassA mutual funds. Revenue is recorded at the time of the sale of the product.
Other revenue also includes equity method investment earnings related to operating advisory company investments and marketing fees earned for services to distribute Barclays iPath products, which are related to exchange-traded notes issued by Barclays.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Stock-based Compensation The Company applies the requirements within ASC 718-10, Compensation  Stock Compensation (ASC 718-10), which establish standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, primarily focusing on the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. Entities are required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service (usually the vesting period) in exchange for the stock award.
The Company measures the grant-date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments using option-pricing models. If an equity award is modified after the grant date, incremental compensation cost is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification. The grant-date fair value of restricted stock units is calculated using the Companys share price on the date of grant. Compensation cost is recorded by the Company on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award is, in-substance, multiple awards. Awards under the Companys stock-based compensation plans vest over periods ranging from one to five years. Compensation cost is reduced by the number of awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting. Forfeiture estimates generally are derived using historical forfeiture information, where available, and are reviewed for reasonableness at least annually.
The Company amortizes the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation awards made to retirement eligible employees over the required service period. Upon notification of retirement, the Company accelerates the unamortized portion of the award over the contractually-required retirement notification period, if applicable.
The Company pays cash dividend equivalents that are not subject to vesting on outstanding restricted stock units (RSUs) granted prior to 2009. ASC 718-10 requires dividend equivalents on RSUs expected to be forfeited to be included in compensation and benefits expense. Dividend equivalents on participating shares expected to vest are recorded in retained earnings.
Distribution and Servicing Costs Distribution and servicing costs include payments to third parties and affiliates, including Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC and Barclays, primarily associated with distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Distribution and servicing costs are expensed when incurred.
Direct Fund Expenses Direct fund expenses, which are expensed as incurred, primarily consist of third party non-advisory expenses incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of certain index trademarks, reference data for certain indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, audit and tax services as well as other fund related expenses directly attributable to the non-advisory operations of the fund.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Leases The Company accounts for its operating leases, which may include escalations, in accordance with ASC 840-10, Leases . The Company expenses the lease payments associated with operating leases evenly during the lease term (including rent-free periods), beginning on the commencement of the lease term.
Foreign Exchange Monetary assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries having non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at exchange rates at the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition. Non-monetary assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries having non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders equity on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in general and administration expense on the consolidated statements of income. For the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded gains/(losses) from foreign currency transactions of $6 million, ($11) million and $50 million, respectively.
Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740-10, Income Taxes (ASC 740-10). Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred income tax assets based upon expected future earnings, taxable income in prior carryback years, future deductibility of the asset, changes in applicable tax laws and other factors. If management determines that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance will be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to income tax expense on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability.
ASC 740-10 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements by prescribing a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. ASC 740-10 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
Excess tax benefits and shortfalls related to stock-based compensation are recognized as additional paid-in capital and are reflected as financing cash flows on the consolidated statements of cash flows. If the Company does not have additional paid-in capital credits (cumulative tax benefits recorded to additional paid-in capital), the Company will record an expense for any deficit between the recorded tax benefit and tax return benefit. At December31, 2010 and 2009, BlackRock had excess additional paid-in capital credits to absorb potential future deficits between recorded tax benefits and tax return benefits.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Earnings per Share (EPS) EPS is calculated pursuant to the two-class method as defined in ASC 260-10, Earnings per Share (ASC 260-10), which specifies that all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities and should be included in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class method.
The Company presents both basic and diluted EPS amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to common shareholders, excluding participating securities, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. The Companys participating securities consist of its unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents. Diluted EPS includes the determinants of basic EPS and, in addition, reflects the impact of other potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period using the two-class method.
Due to the similarities in terms among BlackRock series A, B, C and D non-voting participating preferred stock and the Companys common stock, the Company considers each series of non-voting participating preferred stock to be common stock equivalents for purposes of earnings per common share calculations.
In accordance with ASC 260-10, shares of the Companys common stock are not included in basic earnings per common share until contingencies are resolved and the shares are released. Shares of the Companys common stock are not included in diluted earnings per common share unless the contingency has been met assuming that the contingency period ended on the date of the consolidated statement of financial condition.
Business Segments The Companys management directs BlackRocks operations as one business, the asset management business. As such, the Company operates in one business segment as defined in ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting (ASC 280-10).

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Business Combinations The Company accounts for business combinations in accordance with the requirements of ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805). The fundamental requirement of ASC 805 is that the acquisition method of accounting (the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. The provisions within ASC 805 further define the acquirer, establish the acquisition date and broaden the scope of transactions that qualify as business combinations.
Additionally, the requirements within ASC 805 change the fair value measurement provisions for assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, provide guidance for the measurement of fair value in a step acquisition, change the requirements for recognizing assets acquired and liabilities assumed subject to contingencies, provide guidance on recognition and measurement of contingent consideration and require that acquisition-related costs of the acquirer generally be expensed as incurred. Reversal of valuation allowances related to acquired deferred tax assets and changes to liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions assumed in business combinations that settled prior to the adoption of the new requirements within ASC 805 affected goodwill. If such valuation allowances reverse or liabilities change subsequent to the adoption of the new requirements within ASC 805, such changes will affect the income tax provision in the period of reversal or change.
The Company adopted the requirements within ASC 805 on January1, 2009. The adoption of the new requirements within ASC 805 impacted the Companys consolidated financial statements for the year ended December31, 2009 as the Company completed its acquisition of BGI during 2009 and certain acquisition related costs were expensed as incurred.
In addition, in accordance with the requirements of ASC 805, certain line items on the consolidated statement of financial condition, including goodwill, intangible assets, and deferred tax liabilities, have been retrospectively adjusted as of December31, 2009 to reflect new information obtained about facts that existed as of December1, 2009, the BGI acquisition date. See Note 3, Mergers and Acquisitions, for a summary of the changes in 2010 to the BGI purchase price allocation.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820-10), requires among other things, disclosures about assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value.
Hierarchy of Fair Value Inputs The provisions of ASC 820-10 establish a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and require companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide additional disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. See Accounting Policies Adopted in the Year Ended December31, 2010 below for more information on additional fair value disclosure requirements adopted in 2010.
Assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date.
Level 1 assets may include listed mutual funds (including those accounted for under the equity method of accounting as these mutual funds are investment companies, that have publicly available NAVs which in accordance with GAAP are calculated under fair value measures and are equal to the earnings of such funds), ETFs, equities and certain derivatives.
Level 2 Inputs: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; quotes from pricing services or brokers, for which the Company can determine that orderly transactions took place at the quoted price or that the inputs used to arrive at the price were observable; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. As a practical expedient, the Company relies on the net asset values (NAVs) (or its equivalents) of certain investments as their fair value.
Level 2 assets in this category may include debt securities, bank loans, short-term floating rate notes and asset-backed securities, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain equity method limited partnership interests in hedge funds and mutual funds valued based on NAV where the Company has the ability to redeem at the measurement date or within the near term without redemption restrictions, restricted public securities valued at a discount, as well as over the counter derivatives, including interest and inflation rate swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts that have inputs to the valuations that generally can be corroborated by observable market data.
F-26 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability, which may include non-binding broker quotes. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Certain investments that are valued using a NAV and are subject to current redemption restrictions that will not be lifted in the near term are included in Level 3.
Level 3 assets in this category include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds, direct private equity investments held within consolidated funds, bank loans and certain held for sale real estate disposal assets.
Level 3 inputs include BlackRock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments, including distressed credit hedge funds, real estate and private equity funds, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices. The various partnerships are investment companies, which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally require the fund to utilize pricing/valuation information, including independent appraisals, from third party sources. However, in some instances, current valuation information for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances, fund management may perform model-based analytical valuations that may be used as an input to value these investments.
Level 3 liabilities included in this category include borrowings of consolidated collateralized loan obligations valued based upon non-binding single broker quotes.
Significance of Inputs The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument.
F-27 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Option ASC 825-10, Financial Instruments (ASC 825-10), provides a fair value option election that allows companies to irrevocably elect fair value as the initial and subsequent accounting measurement attribute for certain financial assets and liabilities. ASC 825-10 permits entities to elect to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value on an ongoing basis. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. The decision to elect the fair value option is determined on an instrument by instrument basis, must be applied to an entire instrument and is irrevocable once elected. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value pursuant to ASC 825-10 are required to be reported separately from those instruments measured using another accounting method. In 2010, the Company elected the fair value option for certain assets and liabilities of consolidated CLOs. See Accounting Policies Adopted in the Year Ended December31, 2010 below for more information.
Disclosure of Fair Value The disclosure requirements within ASC 825-10 require disclosure of estimated fair values of certain financial instruments, both on and off the consolidated statements of financial condition. For financial instruments recognized at fair value in the statement of financial position, the disclosure requirements of ASC 820-10 also apply.
The methods and assumptions are set forth below:  Cash and cash equivalents are carried at either cost or amortized cost which approximates fair value due to their short term maturities. Money market funds are valued through the use of quoted market prices, or $1.00, which generally is the net asset value of the fund.
The carrying amounts of receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
The fair value of marketable investments is based on quoted market prices or broker quotes. If investments are not readily marketable, fair values primarily are determined based on net asset values (or capital accounts) of investments in limited partnerships/limited liability companies or by the Company based on managements assumptions or estimates, taking into consideration financial information of the investment, the industry of the investment, market indices or valuation services from third party service providers. At December31, 2010, with the exception of certain equity and cost method investments and carried interest that are not accounted for under a fair value measure, the carrying value of investments approximated fair value. See Note 7, Fair Value Disclosures, for further discussion.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ASC 815-10, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815-10), establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivatives embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. ASC 815-10 generally requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition and to measure those investments at fair value.
The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging (a)exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of certain assets and liabilities and (b)market exposures for certain investments. The Company may also use derivatives within separate account assets and liabilities, which are segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts, or in connection with capital support agreements with affiliated investment companies. In addition, certain consolidated sponsored investment funds may also invest in derivatives as a part of their investment strategy.
Changes in the fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments are recognized in current earnings and, where applicable, are offset by the corresponding gain or loss on the related foreign-denominated assets or liabilities or hedged investments, on the consolidated statements of income.
Comprehensive Income Attributable to BlackRock Subsequent to the issuance of BlackRocks second quarter 2010 Form 10-Q, filed with the SEC on August6, 2010, the Company determined that pursuant to ASC 810, it should have presented the amount of comprehensive income attributable to non-controlling interests and comprehensive income attributable to BlackRock on its consolidated statements of comprehensive income and it mislabeled total comprehensive income as being attributable to BlackRock. The affected periods include each of the two years in the period ended December31, 2009. The accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for years ended December31, 2009 and 2008 have been corrected to include the required information as the Company believes this correction was not material to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.
Subsequent Events The Company discloses subsequent events in accordance with ASC 855-10, Subsequent Events (ASC 855-10), which provides guidance to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued and ASU 2010-09, Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements, which amends ASC 855-10 to clarify that an SEC filer is not required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in the financial statements. See Note 25, Subsequent Events, for further discussion.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Accounting Policies Adopted in the Year Ended December31, 2010 New Consolidation Guidance for Variable Interest Entities In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2009-17, which amended the consolidation guidance for VIEs. The amendments include: (1)the elimination of the exemption from consolidation for qualifying special purpose entities, (2)a new approach for determining the PB of a VIE, which requires that the PB have both (i)the power to control the most significant activities of the VIE and (ii)either the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE, and (3)the requirement to continually reassess the PB of a VIE.
In February 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-10 .
This ASU defers the application of SFAS No.167 for a reporting enterprises interest in an entity if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the entity either has all of the attributes of an investment company, as specified in ASC 946-10, Financial Services-Investment Companies (ASC 946-10) or it is industry practice to apply measurement principles for financial reporting that are consistent with those in ASC 946-10; (2)the entity is not a securitization entity, an asset-backed financing entity, or an entity formerly considered a qualifying special-purpose entity, and (3)the reporting enterprise does not have an explicit or implicit obligation to fund losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity.
In addition, the deferral applies to a reporting entitys interest in an entity that is required to comply or operate in accordance with the requirements of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds.
The amendments in ASU 2010-10 clarify that for entities that do not qualify for the deferral, related parties should be considered when evaluating each of the criteria for determining whether a decision maker or service provider fee represents a variable interest.
An entity that qualifies for the deferral will continue to be assessed for consolidation under the overall guidance on variable interest entities in ASC 810, (before its amendment by SFAS No.167) or other applicable consolidation guidance, including guidance for the consolidation of partnerships in ASC 810. The amendment does not defer the disclosure requirements of ASU 2009-17.
On January1, 2010, upon adoption of ASU 2009-17, the Company determined it was the PB of three CLOs, which resulted in consolidation of these CLOs on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Upon consolidation, the Company elected the fair value option for eligible financial assets and liabilities to mitigate accounting mismatches between the carrying value of the assets and liabilities and to achieve operational simplifications. Upon adoption of the provisions of ASU 2009-17, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to appropriated retained earnings of $114 million.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Accounting Policies Adopted in the Year Ended December31, 2010 (continued) Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASU 2010-06). ASU 2010-06 amended ASC 820-10 to require new disclosures with regards to significant transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2. ASU 2010-06 also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the appropriate level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements that fall in either Level 2 or Level 3. The new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2009. The adoption on January1, 2010 of the additional disclosure requirements of ASU 2010-06 did not materially impact BlackRocks financial statement disclosures.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted Additional Level 3 Fair Value Rollforward Disclosures In addition, ASU 2010-06 requires separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and other settlements in the rollforward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of the additional Level 3 rollforward disclosure requirements is not expected to materially impact BlackRocks financial statement disclosures.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 3. Mergers and Acquisitions Barclays Global Investors On December1, 2009, BlackRock acquired from Barclays all of the outstanding equity interests of subsidiaries of Barclays conducting the investment management business of BGI in exchange for an aggregate of 37,566,771 shares of BlackRock common stock and participating preferred stock and $6.65 billion in cash. The fair value of the 37,566,771 shares at closing, on December1, 2009, was $8.53 billion, at a price of $227.08 per share, the closing price of BlackRocks common stock on November30, 2009.
The shares of capital stock issued to Barclays pursuant to the BGI Transaction represented approximately 4.8% of the outstanding shares of common stock and approximately an aggregate 19.8% economic interest in BlackRock immediately following the closing of the transaction. Barclays generally is restricted from purchasing additional shares of BlackRock common or preferred stock if it would result in Barclays holding more than 4.9% of the total voting power of BlackRock or more than 19.9% of the total capital stock of BlackRock on a fully diluted basis. In addition, after the close of the BGI Transaction, Barclays was restricted from transferring 100% of its BlackRock capital stock for one year after closing and 50% of its BlackRock capital stock for the second year, without the prior written consent of BlackRock.
The cash portion of the purchase price was funded through a combination of existing cash, issuance of short-term debt backed by a short-term credit facility which was arranged by Barclays, a related party, and subsequently terminated upon the issuance of long-term notes in December 2009, and proceeds from the private issuance of 19,914,652 shares of common and preferred stock, at a price of $140.60, to a group of institutional investors, including PNC.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 3. Mergers and Acquisitions (continued) Barclays Global Investors (continued) The BGI Transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities and non-controlling interests assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of the transaction. Substantially all of the excess of the final purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities and non-controlling interests assumed was recorded as non-deductible goodwill.
A summary of the initial and revised fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities and non-controlling interests assumed on December1, 2009 in this acquisition is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Initial Estimate of Fair Value Purchase Price Adjustments Revised Estimate of Fair Value Accounts receivable $ 593 ($ 12 ) $ 581 Investments 125  125 Separate account assets 116,301  116,301 Collateral held under securities lending agreements 23,498  23,498 Property and equipment 205 (2 ) 203 Finite-lived intangible management contracts (intangible assets) 163 (7 ) 156 Indefinite-lived intangible management contracts (intangible assets) 9,785 25 9,810 Trade names / trademarks (indefinite-lived intangible assets) 1,403  1,403 Goodwill 6,842 110 6,952 Other assets 366 16 382 Separate account liabilities (116,301 )  (116,301 ) Collateral liability under securities lending agreements (23,498 )  (23,498 ) Deferred income tax liabilities (3,799 ) (45 ) (3,844 ) Accrued compensation and benefits (885 )  (885 ) Other liabilities assumed (660 ) (85 ) (745 ) Non-controlling interest assumed (12 )  (12 ) Total consideration, net of cash acquired $ 14,126 $  $ 14,126 Summary of consideration, net of cash acquired: Cash paid $ 6,650 $  $ 6,650 Cash acquired (1,055 )  (1,055 ) Capital stock at fair value 8,531  8,531 Total cash and stock consideration $ 14,126 $  $ 14,126 The fair value of BGI finite-lived management contracts consists primarily of separate accounts and custom segregated funds and the fair value of BGI indefinite-lived management contracts primarily consists of exchange-traded funds, collective investment trusts and other investment funds.

During the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded other-than-temporary impairments of less than $1 million, $5 million, and $8 million, respectively, which were recorded in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. The other-than-temporary impairments in 2009 included $2 million related to credit loss impairments on debt securities, which were determined by comparing the estimated discounted cash flows versus the amortized cost for each individual security.
The Company has reviewed the gross unrealized losses of $1 million as of December31, 2010 related to available-for-sale equity securities, which had been in a loss position for greater than twelve months, and determined that these unrealized losses were not other-than-temporary primarily because the Company has the ability and intent to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. As a result, the Company did not record impairments on such equity securities.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 6. Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment funds primarily because it is deemed to control such funds in accordance with GAAP. The investments that are owned by these consolidated sponsored investment funds are classified as other or trading investments. At December31, 2010 and 2009, the following table presents the balances related to these consolidated funds that were included on the consolidated statements of financial condition as well as BlackRocks net interest in these funds: (Dollar amounts in millions) December31, 2010 December31, 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 65 $ 75 Investments: Trading investments 60 103 Other investments 337 360 Other assets 3 2 Other liabilities (10 ) (9 ) Non-controlling interests (195 ) (273 ) BlackRocks net interests in consolidated investment funds $ 260 $ 258 At December31, 2009, the above balances included a consolidated sponsored investment fund that was also deemed a VIE. This VIE, as well as three consolidated CLOs, which are also VIEs, were excluded from the December31, 2010 balances in the table above. See Note 8, Variable Interest Entities, for further discussion on these consolidated products.
BlackRocks total exposure to consolidated sponsored investment funds of $260 million and $258 million at December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, represents the value of the Companys economic ownership interest in these sponsored investment funds. Valuation changes associated with these consolidated investment funds are reflected in non-operating income (expense) and partially offset in net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests for the portion not attributable to BlackRock.
The Company may not be readily able to access cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company may not be readily able to sell investments held by consolidated sponsored investment funds in order to obtain cash for use in its operations.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 7. Fair Value Disclosures (continued) Separate Account Assets BlackRock Pensions Limited and BlackRockAssetManagementPensionsLimited, both wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, are registered life insurance companies that maintain separate account assets, representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts, and equal and offsetting separate account non-financial liabilities. The net investment income and net gains and losses attributable to separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owners and are not reported on the Companys consolidated statements of income.
Money Market Funds within Cash and Cash Equivalents At December31, 2010 and 2009, approximately $87 million and $1.4 billion, respectively, of money market funds were recorded within cash and cash equivalents on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. Money market funds are valued through the use of quoted market prices (a Level 1 input), or $1.00, which generally is the net asset value of the fund.
Level 3 Assets Level 3 assets recorded within investments, which include equity method investments and consolidated investments of real estate funds, private equity funds and funds of private equity funds, are valued based upon valuations, including capital accounts, received from internal as well as third party fund managers. Fair valuations of the underlying funds are based on a combination of methods, which may include third-party independent appraisals and discounted cash flow techniques. Direct investments in private equity companies held by funds of private equity funds are valued based on an assessment of each underlying investment, incorporating evaluation of additional significant third party financing, changes in valuations of comparable peer companies, the business environment of the companies and market indices, among other factors.
Level 3 assets recorded within separate account assets include single broker non-binding quotes for fixed income securities and equity securities which have unobservable inputs due to certain corporate actions.
Level 3 assets of consolidated VIEs include bank loans valued based on single broker non-binding quotes and direct private equity investments and private equity funds valued based upon valuations received from internal as well as third party fund managers, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices.
Level 3 Liabilities Level 3 liabilities recorded as borrowings of consolidated VIEs include CLO borrowings valued based upon single broker non-binding quotes.

A portion of net income (loss) for consolidated investments and all of the net income (loss) for consolidated VIEs is allocated to non-controlling interests to reflect net income (loss) not attributable to the Company.
Significant Transfers in and/or out of Levels Transfers in and/or out of Levels are reflected as of the beginning of the period when significant inputs, including market inputs or performance attributes, used for the fair value measurement become observable / unobservable, or when the Company determines it has the ability, or no longer has the ability, to redeem in the near term certain investments that the Company values using a NAV (or a capital account), or when the book value of certain equity method investments no longer represents fair value as determined under fair value methodologies.
Separate Account Assets In the year ended December31, 2010 there were $1.5 billion of net transfers out of Level 3 to Level 2 related to debt securities held within separate account assets. The net transfers in Levels were primarily due to availability of observable market inputs, including additional inputs from pricing vendors and brokers.
In the year ended December31, 2010 there were $63 million of net transfers of equity securities held within separate account assets into Level 3 from Level 1 and Level 2. The net transfers into Level 3 were primarily due to market inputs no longer being considered observable.
Significant Other Settlements in 2010 As of January1, 2010, upon the adoption of ASU 2009-17 there was a $35 million reclassification of assets from Level 3 private equity investments to Level 3 private equity assets of consolidated VIEs as well as the consolidation of $1,157 million of borrowings within the consolidated CLOs.

Fair Value Disclosures (continued) Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value Per Share (continued) (b) This category includes the underlying third party private equity funds within consolidated BlackRock sponsored private equity funds of funds. The fair values of the investments in the third party funds have been estimated using the net asset value of the Companys ownership interest in partners capital in each fund in the portfolio as well as other performance inputs. These investments are not subject to redemption, however, for certain funds the Company may sell or transfer its interest, which may need approval by the general partner of the underlying funds. Due to the nature of the investments in this category, the Company reduces its investment by distributions that are received through the realization of the underlying assets of the funds. It is estimated that the underlying assets of these funds will be liquidated over a weighted-average period of approximately 8 years. Total remaining unfunded commitments to other third party funds is $62 million. The Company is contractually obligated to fund only $42 million to the consolidated funds, while the remaining unfunded balances in the table above are required to be funded by capital contributions from non-controlling interest holders.
(c) This category includes several consolidated funds of hedge funds that invest in multiple strategies to diversify risks. The fair values of the investments in this category have been estimated using the net asset value of the funds ownership interest in partners capital of each fund in the portfolio. Investments in this category generally can be redeemed, as long as there are no restrictions in place by the underlying funds.
(d) This category includes hedge funds and funds of hedge funds that invest primarily in equities, fixed income securities, distressed credit and mortgage instruments and other third party hedge funds. The fair values of the investments in this category have been estimated using the net asset value of the Companys ownership interest in partners capital. It is estimated that the investments in the funds that are not subject to redemptions will be liquidated over a weighted-average period of less than 7 years.
(e) This category includes several private equity funds that initially invest in non-marketable securities of private companies, which ultimately may become public in the future. The fair values of these investments have been estimated using the net asset value of the Companys ownership interest in partners capital as well as other performance inputs. The Companys investment in each fund is not subject to redemption and is normally returned through distributions as a result of the liquidation of the underlying assets of the private equity funds. It is estimated that the investment in these funds will be liquidated over a weighted-average period of approximately 5 years.
(f) This category includes several real estate funds that invest primarily to acquire, expand, renovate, finance, hold for investment, and ultimately sell income-producing apartment properties or to capitalize on the distress in the residential real estate market. The fair values of the investments in this category have been estimated using the net asset value of the Companys ownership interest in partners capital. The majority of the Companys investments in these funds is not subject to redemption and is normally returned through distributions as a result of the liquidation of the underlying assets of the real estate funds. It is estimated that the investments in these funds will be liquidated over a weighted-average period of approximately 7 years.

Fair Value Option Upon consolidation of three CLOs on January1, 2010, the Company elected to adopt the fair value option provisions for eligible assets and liabilities, including bank loans and borrowings of the CLOs. To the extent there is a difference between the change in fair value of the assets and liabilities, the difference will be reflected as net income (loss) attributable to nonredeemable non-controlling interests on the consolidated statements of income and offset by a change in appropriated retained earnings on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
The following table presents, as of December31, 2010, the fair value of those assets and liabilities selected for fair value accounting: (Dollar amounts in millions) December31, 2010 CLO Bank Loans: Aggregate principal amounts outstanding $ 1,245 Fair value $ 1,162 Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value $ 83 Unpaid principal balance of loans more than 90 days past due $ 3 Aggregate fair value of loans more than 90 days past due $ 1 Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value for loans more than 90 days past due $ 2 CLO Borrowings: Aggregate principal amounts outstanding $ 1,430 Fair value $ 1,278 The principal amounts outstanding of the borrowings issued by the CLOs mature between 2016 and 2019.
During the year ended December31, 2010, the change in fair value of the bank loans, along with the bonds held at fair value, resulted in a $148 million gain, which was offset by a $175 million loss in the fair value of the CLO borrowings. The net loss was recorded in net gain (loss) on consolidated VIEs on the consolidated statement of income. The change in fair value of the assets and liabilities includes interest income and expense, respectively.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 8. Variable Interest Entities In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles, including CDOs/CLOs and sponsored investment funds, which may be considered VIEs. The Company receives advisory fees and/or other incentive related fees for its services and may from time to time own equity or debt securities or enter into derivatives with the vehicles, each of which are considered variable interests. The Company enters into these variable interests principally to address client needs through the launch of such investment vehicles. The VIEs are primarily financed via capital contributed by equity and debt holders. The Companys involvement in financing the operations of the VIEs is limited to its equity interests.
The PB of a VIE that is an investment fund that meets the conditions of ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests, including those of related parties) that will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses, receive a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both. In order to determine whether the Company is the PB of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows of the VIEs. Assumptions made in such analyses may include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, pre-payments, realization of gains, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes.
Effective January1, 2010, the PB of a CDO/CLO or other entity that is a VIE that does not meet the conditions of ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the entity.
VIEs in which BlackRock is the Primary Beneficiary At December31, 2010 At December31, 2010, BlackRock was the primary beneficiary of four VIEs, which included three CLOs in which it did not have an investment, however, BlackRock, as the collateral manager, was deemed to have both the power to control the activities of the CLOs and the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In addition, BlackRock was the primary beneficiary of one sponsored private equity investment fund in which it had a non-substantive investment, which absorbed the majority of the variability due to its de-facto third party relationships with other partners in the fund. The assets of these VIEs are not available to creditors of the Company. In addition, the investors in these VIEs have no recourse to the credit of the Company. At December31, 2010, the following balances related to these four VIEs were consolidated on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2010 Assets of consolidated VIEs: Cash and cash equivalents $ 93 Bank loans, bonds and other investments 1,312 Liabilities of consolidated VIEs: Borrowings (1,278 ) Other liabilities (7 ) Appropriated retained earnings (75 ) Non-controlling interests of consolidated VIEs (45 ) Total net interests in consolidated VIEs $  F-51 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 8. Variable Interest Entities (continued) VIEs in which BlackRock is the Primary Beneficiary (continued) At December31, 2010 (continued) For the year ended December31, 2010, the Company recorded non-operating expense of $35 million offset by a $35 million net loss attributable to nonredeemable non-controlling interests on the Companys consolidated statements of income.
At December31, 2010, bank loans, bonds and other investments of consolidated VIEs were $1,162 million, $113 million, and $37 million, respectively. The weighted-average maturity of the bank loans and bonds was approximately 4.2 years.
At December31, 2009 At December31, 2009, BlackRock was the PB of one VIE, a sponsored private equity investment fund in which it did not have a substantive investment, due to its de-facto third party relationships with other partners in the fund. Due to the consolidation of this VIE, at December31, 2009, the Company recorded $54 million of net assets, primarily comprised of investments and cash and cash equivalents. These net assets were offset by $54 million of nonredeemable non-controlling interests, which reflect the equity ownership of third parties, on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. For the year ended December31, 2009, the Company recorded a non-operating expense of $4 million offset by a $4 million net loss attributable to nonredeemable non-controlling interests on its consolidated statements of income.
VIEs in which the Company holds significant variable interests or is the sponsor that holds a variable interest but is not the Primary Beneficiary of the VIE At December31, 2010 and 2009, the Companys carrying value of assets and liabilities and its maximum risk of loss related to VIEs in which it holds a significant variable interest or is the sponsor that holds a variable interest, but for which it was not the PB, were as follows: At December31, 2010 (Dollar amounts in millions) Variable Interests on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition Investments Advisory Fee Receivables Other Net Assets (Liabilities) Maximum RiskofLoss CDOs/CLOs $ 2 $ 3 ($ 3 ) $ 22 Other sponsored investment funds: Collective trusts  188  188 Private equity funds 14  (7 ) 14 Other 14 52  66 Total $ 30 $ 243 ($ 10 ) $ 290 F-52 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.

Variable Interest Entities (continued) VIEs in which the Company holds significant variable interests or is the sponsor that holds a variable interest but is not the Primary Beneficiary of the VIE (continued) The size of the net assets of the VIEs that the Company does not consolidate related to CDOs/CLOs, collective trust funds and other sponsored investment funds were as follows:  CDOs/CLOs - approximately ($4) billion, comprised of approximately $7 billion of assets at fair value and $11 billion of liabilities, primarily comprised of unpaid principal debt obligations to CDO/CLO debt holders.
Other sponsored investments funds  approximately $1.6 trillion to $1.7 trillion of net assets  This amount includes approximately $1.2 trillion of collective trusts. Each collective trust has been aggregated separately and may include collective trusts that invest in other collective trusts.
The net assets of these VIEs primarily are comprised of cash and cash equivalents and investments offset by liabilities primarily comprised of various accruals for the sponsored investment vehicles.
At December31, 2010, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss associated with these VIEs primarily relates to: (i)BlackRocks investments, (ii)advisory fee receivables and (iii)$17 million of credit protection sold by BlackRock to a third party in a synthetic CDO transaction.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 9. Derivatives and Hedging For the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009, the Company did not hold any derivatives designated in a formal hedge relationship under ASC 815-10.
During 2007, the Company commenced a program to enter into a series of total return swaps to economically hedge against market price exposures with respect to certain seed investments in sponsored investment products. At December31, 2010, the Company had six outstanding total return swaps with two counterparties with an aggregate notional value of approximately $25 million. At December31, 2009, the Company had seven outstanding total return swaps with two counterparties with an aggregate notional value of approximately $36 million.
By using derivative financial instruments, the Company exposes itself to market and counterparty risk. Market risk from forward foreign currency exchange contracts is the effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in currency exchange rates. The Company manages certain exposure to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degrees of market risk that may be undertaken. At December31, 2010, the Company did not have any outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts. At December31, 2009, the Company had two outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts with two counterparties with an aggregate notional value of approximately $100 million.
In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements, up to $100 million, with two enhanced cash funds. These capital support agreements were backed by letters of credit issued under BlackRocks revolving credit facility. In December 2008, the capital support agreements were modified to be up to $45 million and were no longer backed by the letters of credit. In 2009, the capital support agreements were terminated, due to the closure of the related funds. During 2009, the Company provided approximately $4 million of capital contributions to the funds under the capital support agreements. BlackRock determined that the capital support agreements qualified as derivatives under ASC 815-10. Upon closure of the funds in 2009, the liability decreased $11 million to zero and the change in the liability was included in general and administration expenses.
The Company acts as theportfoliomanager in a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction (Pillars).The Company has entered into a credit default swap with Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), providing Citibank credit protection of approximately $17 million, representing the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection.The Companys management has performed an assessment of its variable interest in Pillars (a collateral management agreement and the credit default swap) under ASC 810-10 and has concluded the Company is not Pillars PB.Pursuant to ASC 815-10, the Company carries the Pillars credit default swap at fair value based on the expected future cash flows under the arrangement.
On behalf of clients of the Companys registered life insurance companies that maintain separate accounts representing segregated funds held for the purpose of funding individual and group pension contracts, the Company invests in various derivative instruments, which may include futures and forward foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate and inflation rate swaps.
The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment funds, which may utilize derivative instruments as a part of the funds investment strategy. The change in fair value of such derivatives, which is recorded in non-operating income (expense), was not material to the Companys consolidated financial statements.

During the year ended December31, 2010, goodwill increased by $125 million. The increase resulted from a $136 million release of common shares held in escrow in connection with the Quellos Transaction and the Helix Transaction, offset by a decline related to tax benefits realized from tax-deductible goodwill in excess of book goodwill.
At December31, 2010, the balance of the Quellos tax-deductible goodwill in excess of book goodwill was approximately $353 million. Goodwill related to the Quellos Transaction will continue to be reduced in future periods by the amount of tax benefits realized from tax-deductible goodwill in excess of book goodwill from the Quellos Transaction.
The impairment tests performed for goodwill as of July31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 indicated that no impairment charges were required. The Company continuously monitors its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. As of December31, 2010 the Companys common stock closed at $190.58, which exceeded its book value per share of approximately $136.09 after excluding appropriated retained earnings.

The initial proceeds of the commercial paper issuances were used for the financing of a portion of the BGI Transaction. Subsidiaries of Bank of America and Barclays, as well as other third parties, act as dealers under the CP Program. The CP Program is supported by the 2007 revolving credit facility.
The Company began issuance of CP Notes under the CP Program on November4, 2009. During 2010 all CP Notes outstanding as of December31, 2009 have been repaid and as of December31, 2010, BlackRock did not have any outstanding CP Notes.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 13. Borrowings (continued) Short-Term Borrowings (continued) 2007 Revolving Credit Facility In August 2007, the Company entered into a five-year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December31, 2010.
The 2007 facility provides back-up liquidity, funds ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and funds various investment opportunities. At December31, 2010, the Company had $100 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.47% and a maturity date of February28, 2011.
Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. Bank of America has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility.
Japan Commitment-line In September 2010, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, renewed a five billion Japanese yen commitment-line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment-line).The term of the renewed Japan Commitment-line is one year and will accrue interest on outstanding borrowings at the applicable Japanese short-term prime rate. The Japan Commitment-line is intended to provide liquidity and flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December31, 2010, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment-line.
Convertible Debentures The maturity amount and carrying value of the 2.625% convertible debentures due in 2035 included the following: (Dollar amounts in millions) December31, 2010 December31, 2009 Maturity amount / Carrying value $ 67 $ 243 Fair value $ 128 $ 486 In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million of convertible debentures (the Debentures), due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625%per annum. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on February15 and August15 of each year.
F-61 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 13. Borrowings (continued) Convertible Debentures (continued) The Company retrospectively adopted the requirements of ASC 470-20 on January1, 2009 (see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, for further discussion) resulting in a total cumulative impact of a $9 million reduction to retained earnings at December31, 2008. The effective borrowing rate for nonconvertible debt at the time of issuance was estimated to be 4.3%, which resulted in $18 million of the $250 million initial aggregate principal amount of the Debentures issued, or $12 million after tax, being attributable to equity. The Company recognized interest expense of $2 million, $10 million and $10 million for years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, comprised of $2 million, $6 million and $7 million related to the coupon and less than $1 million, $4 million and $3 million related to amortization of the discount for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 respectively. As of March31, 2010, the initial $18 million debt discount was fully amortized.
Prior to February15, 2009, the Debentures could have been convertible at the option of the holder at a December31, 2008 conversion rate of 9.9639 shares of common stock per one dollar principal amount of Debentures under certain circumstances. Commencing on February15, 2009, at any time prior to maturity at the option of the holder the Debentures became convertible into cash and in some situations as described below, additional shares of the Companys common stock at the current conversion rate. During the year ended December31, 2010, holders of $176 million of Debentures converted their holdings into cash and approximately 942,000 shares.
At the time the Debentures are tendered for conversion, for each one dollar principal amount of Debentures converted, a holder shall be entitled to receive cash and shares of BlackRock common stock, if any, the aggregate value of which (the conversion value) will be determined by multiplying the applicable conversion rate by the average of the daily volume weighted average price of BlackRock common stock for each of the ten consecutive trading days beginning on the second trading day immediately following the day the Debentures are tendered for conversion (the ten-day weighted average price). The Company will deliver the conversion value to holders as follows: (1)an amount in cash (the principal return) equal to the lesser of (a)the aggregate conversion value of the Debentures to be converted and (b)the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures to be converted, and (2)if the aggregate conversion value of the Debentures to be converted is greater than the principal return, an amount in shares (the net shares), determined as set forth below, equal to such aggregate conversion value less the principal return (the net share amount). The number of net shares to be paid will be determined by dividing the net share amount by the ten-day weighted average price.
The conversion rate for the Debentures is subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain corporate events, such as a change of control of the Company or payment of quarterly dividends greater than $0.30 per share. The initial conversion rate of 9.7282 was determined by the underwriters based on market conditions and has been subsequently revised to 10.2628 as a result of dividends paid by the Company that were in excess of $0.30 per share.

Holders of the Debentures have the right to require the Company to repurchase the Debentures for cash on February15, 2015, 2020, 2025 and 2030. In addition, holders of the Debentures may require the Company to repurchase the Debentures for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, including contingent interest and accrued and unpaid liquidated damages, if any, (i)upon a change of control of the Company or (ii)if BlackRocks common stock is neither listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange nor approved for trading on the NASDAQ.

The 2017 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make-whole redemption price. The 2017 Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over their ten-year term. The Company incurred approximately $4 million of debt issuance costs, which are being amortized over ten years. As of December31, 2010, $3 million of unamortized debt issuance costs were included in other assets on the consolidated statement of financial condition.

Net proceeds of this offering were used to repay borrowings under the CP Program, which was used to finance a portion of the BGI Transaction, and for general corporate purposes. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June10 and December10 of each year in an amount of approximately $96 million per year. These notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make-whole redemption price. These notes were issued collectively at a discount of $5 million which is being amortized over the respective terms of the notes.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 14. Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Commitments During 2010, the Company entered into a purchase obligation for construction services related to Drapers Gardens of approximately $67 million. The Company incurred $4 million of construction services, which is recorded in property and equipment, during the year ended December31, 2010 resulting in a remaining obligation of approximately $63 million.
Investment Commitments At December31, 2010, the Company had $183 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds, including funds of private equity funds, real estate funds and distressed credit funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third party funds as third party non-controlling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 14. Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingencies Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions On October1, 2007, the Company acquired the fund of funds business of Quellos. As part of this transaction, Quellos is entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment was paid in 2009 and the second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, would have been payable in cash in 2011.
During 2009, the Company determined the first contingent payment to be $219 million, of which $11 million was previously paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $208 million, $156 million was paid in cash and $52 million was paid in common stock, or approximately 330,000 shares based on a price of $157.33 per share. Quellos was entitled to a catch-up payment related to the first contingent payment if certain performance measures were met in 2010 as the value of the first contingent payment was less than $374 million. At December31, 2010, the base and performance fee measures were not achieved and therefore the remaining contingent payments will not occur.
In connection with the acquisition of SSR, the holding company of State Street Research and Management Company, which closed in January 2005, the Company made a final contingent payment in August 2010 of approximately $8 million based on the Companys retained assets under management associated with the MetLife, Inc. defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
Capital Support Agreements In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements, up to $100 million, with two enhanced cash funds. These capital support agreements were backed by letters of credit issued under BlackRocks revolving credit facility. In December 2008, the capital support agreements were modified to be up to $45 million and were no longer backed by the letters of credit. In January and May 2009, the capital support agreements were terminated due to the closure of the related funds. During the six months ended June30, 2009, the Company provided approximately $4 million of capital contributions to the funds under the capital support agreements. At December31, 2008, the derivative liability for the fair value of the capital support agreements for the two funds totaled approximately $18 million. The fair value of these liabilities increased and decreased as BlackRocks obligation under the guarantee fluctuated based on the fair value of the derivative. Upon closure of the funds, the liability decreased $11 million to zero, while the change in the liability was included in general and administration expenses.
Other Contingent Payments The Company acts as the portfolio manager in a series of credit default swap transactions and has a maximum potential exposure of $17 million under a credit default swap between the Company and Citibank. See Note 9, Derivatives and Hedging, for further discussion of this transaction and the related commitment.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 14. Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Legal Proceedings From time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various U.S. federal, state governmental and domestic and international regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide or other investigations or proceedings. It is BlackRocks policy to cooperate fully with such inquiries. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRocks activities. Additionally, certain of the investment funds that the Company manages are subject to lawsuits, any of which potentially could harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the Company being liable to the funds for any resulting damages.
Management, after consultation with legal counsel, currently does not anticipate that the aggregate liability, if any, arising out of regulatory matters or lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on BlackRocks earnings, financial position, or cash flows, although, at the present time, management is not in a position to determine whether any such pending or threatened matters will have a material adverse effect on BlackRocks results of operations in any future reporting period.
Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts pursuant to which it may agree to indemnify third parties in certain circumstances. The terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined.
Under the transaction agreement in the MLIM Transaction, the Company has agreed to indemnify Merrill Lynch for losses it may incur arising from (1)any alleged or actual breach, failure to comply, violation or other deficiency with respect to any regulatory or fiduciary requirements relating to the operation of BlackRocks business, (2)any fees or expenses incurred or owed by BlackRock to any brokers, financial advisors or comparable other persons retained or employed by BlackRock in connection with the MLIM Transaction, and (3)certain specified tax covenants.
Under the transaction agreement in the BGI Transaction, the Company has agreed to indemnify Barclays for losses it may incur arising from (1)breach by the Company of certain representations, (2)breach by the Company of any covenant in the agreement, (3)liabilities of the entities acquired in the transaction other than liabilities assumed by Barclays or for which it is providing indemnification, and (4)certain taxes.
Management believes that the likelihood of any liability arising under the MLIM Transaction or the BGI Transaction indemnification provisions is remote.Management cannot estimate any potential maximum exposuredue both to the remoteness of any potential claims and the fact that items that wouldbe included within any such calculatedclaim would be beyond the control of BlackRock. Consequently, no liability has been recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition.

The BlackRock, Inc. 2002 Long-Term Retention and Incentive Plan (the 2002 LTIP Awards) permitted the grant of up to $240 million in deferred compensation awards, of which the Company previously granted approximately $233 million. Approximately $208 million of the 2002 LTIP Awards were paid in January 2007. The 2002 LTIP Awards were settled for approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in approximately 1million shares of BlackRock common stock contributed by PNC and distributed to plan participants. During the year ended December31, 2010, the remaining $6 million of previously issued 2002 LTIP Awards were settled in cash and BlackRock shares held by PNC at a conversion price approximating the market price on the settlement date. On the payment date, the Company recorded a capital contribution from PNC for the amount of shares funded by PNC.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 15. Stock-Based Compensation (continued) Long-Term Incentive Plans Funded by PNC (continued) During 2007, the Company granted additional long-term incentive awards, out of the Award Plan, of approximately 1.6million RSUs, that will be settled using BlackRock shares held by PNC in accordance with the share surrender agreement. The RSU awards will vest on September29, 2011, the end of the service condition, as BlackRock had actual GAAP EPS in excess of $5.20, the applicable performance hurdle in 2009. The value of the RSUs was calculated using BlackRocks closing stock price on the date of grant. The grant date fair value of the RSUs is being amortized as an expense using the straight-line method over the vesting period, net of expected forfeitures. The maximum value of awards that may be funded by PNC, prior to the earlier of September29, 2011 or the date the performance criteria are met, is approximately $271 million, all of which was granted as of December31, 2009.
Subsequent to September29, 2011, the remaining shares committed by PNC, of approximately 1.3million, would be available to fund future long-term incentive awards.
Stock Options Stock option grants were made to certain employees pursuant to the Award Plan in 1999 through 2007. Options granted have a ten-year life, vest ratably over periods ranging from two to five years and become exercisable upon vesting. The Company has not granted any stock options subsequent to the January 2007 grant which will vest on September29, 2011 as the Company had actual GAAP EPS in excess of $5.20, the applicable performance hurdle in 2009. Stock option activity for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is summarized below: Outstanding at Shares under option Weighted average exercise price December31, 2007 4,101,165 $ 86.19 Exercised (662,013 ) $ 36.36 Forfeited (298,635 ) $ 167.76 December31, 2008 3,140,517 $ 88.82 Exercised (490,617 ) $ 34.92 Forfeited (8,064 ) $ 167.76 December31, 2009 2,641,836 $ 98.59 Exercised (288,100 ) $ 39.35 Forfeited (9,002 ) $ 167.76 December31, 2010 (1) 2,344,734 $ 105.60 (1) At December31, 2010, approximately 2.3million options were vested or are expected to vest.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 16. Employee Benefit Plans Deferred Compensation Plans Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plan The Company adopted a Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plan (VDCP) that allows participants to elect to defer between 1% and 100% of their annual cash incentive compensation. The participants must specify a deferral period of one, three, five or ten years. The Company funds the obligation through the establishment of a rabbi trust on behalf of the plans participants.
Rabbi Trust The rabbi trust established for the VDCP, with assets totaling $66 million and $57 million as of December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, is reflected in investments on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. Such investments are classified as trading and other investments. The corresponding liability balance of $66 million and $57 million as of December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, is reflected on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition as accrued compensation and benefits. Earnings in the rabbi trust, including unrealized appreciation or depreciation, are reflected as non-operating income (expense) and changes in the corresponding liability are reflected as employee compensation and benefits expense on the consolidated statements of income.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 16. Employee Benefit Plans (continued) Deferred Compensation Plans (continued) Other Deferred Compensation Plans The Company has additional compensation plans for the purpose of providing deferred compensation and retention incentives to certain employees. For these plans, the final value of the deferred amount to be distributed upon vesting is associated with the returns of certain investment funds. The liability balances for these plans were $13 million and $38 million as of December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and are reflected in the Companys statements of financial condition as accrued compensation and benefits. In January 2011, the Company granted approximately $36 million of additional deferred compensation which will fluctuate with investment returns and will vest ratably over three years from the date of grant.
SSR and Realty had deferred compensation plans that allowed participants to elect to defer a portion of their annual incentive compensation or commissions for either a fixed term or until retirement and invest the funds in specified investments. SSR has funded a portion of the obligation through the purchase of company-owned life insurance (COLI) policies to the benefit of SSR. The COLI assets are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition, and at December31, 2010 and 2009, the value of the COLI assets was $11 million and $11 million, respectively, which were recorded in other assets. Changes in the cash surrender value of the COLI policies are recorded to non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. In addition, the Company has recorded a related obligation to repay the deferred incentive compensation, plus applicable earnings, to employees, which totaled $10 million and $11 million which were recorded in accrued compensation and benefits on the consolidated statements of financial condition as of December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Changes in the Companys obligations under these plans, as a result of appreciation or depreciation of the underlying investments in an employees account, are recorded as compensation and benefits expense on the consolidated statements of income. Both plans no longer allow participants to defer a portion of their annual incentive compensation or commissions.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 16. Employee Benefit Plans (continued) Defined Contribution Plans BlackRock Retirement Savings Plan Certain of the Companys employees participate in the BlackRock Retirement Savings Plan (BRSP). Under the BRSP, employee contributions of up to 6% of eligible compensation, as defined by the plan and subject to Internal Revenue Code limitations (IRC), are matched by the Company at 50%. As part of the BRSP, the Company also will make an annual retirement contribution on behalf of each eligible participant equal to no less than 3% of eligible compensation, plus an additional amount, determined at the discretion of the Company, not to exceed 2% of eligible compensation for a total contribution of no more than 5% of eligible compensation, who has attained one year of service and remain employed with the Company through the end of the plan year. The BRSP expense for the Company was $35 million, $24 million and $33 million for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Contributions to the BRSP are made in cash and no new investments in BlackRock stock or matching contributions of stock are available in the BRSP.
Effective January1, 2011, all U.S. employees, including U.S. legacy BGI employees, will participate in the BRSP. All plan assets in the two legacy BGI plans, including the 401K Plan and Retirement Plan (see below), were merged into the BRSP on January1, 2011. Under the combined BRSP, employee contributions of up to 8% of eligible compensation, as defined by the plan and subject to IRC limitations, will be matched by the Company at 50%. In addition, the Company will continue to make an annual retirement contribution to eligible participants equal to 3-5% of eligible compensation.
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company 401(k) Savings Plan (formerly the BGI 401(k) Savings Plan) The Company assumed a 401(k) Plan (the BGI Plan) covering employees of former BGI as a result of the BGI Transaction. As part of the BGI Plan, employee contributions for participants with at least one year of service were matched at 200% of participants pre-tax contributions up to 2% of base salary and overtime, and matched 100% of the next 2% of base salary and overtime, as defined by the plan and subject to IRC limitations. The maximum matching contribution a participant would have received is an amount equal to 6% of base salary up to the IRC limitations. The BGI Plan expense was $12 million for the year ended December31, 2010 and immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements for the year ended December31, 2009. Effective January1, 2011, the net assets of this plan merged into the BRSP.
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company Retirement Plan (formerly the BGI Retirement Plan) The Company assumed a defined contribution money purchase pension plan (BGI Retirement Plan) as a result of the BGI Transaction. All salaried employees of former BGI and its participating affiliates who were U.S. residents on the U.S. payroll were eligible to participate. For participants earning less than $100,000 in base salary, the Company contributed 6% of a participants total compensation (base salary, overtime and performance bonus) up to $100,000. For participants earning $100,000 or more in base salary, the Company contributed 6% of a participants base salary and overtime up to the IRC limitation of $245,000 in 2010. These contributions were 25% vested once the participant has completed two years of service and then vested at a rate of 25% for each additional year of service completed. Employees with five or more years of service under the Retirement Plan were 100% vested in their entire balance. The Retirement Plan expense was $13 million for the year ended December31, 2010 and immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements for the year ended December31, 2009. Effective January1, 2011, the net assets of this plan merged into the BRSP.
BlackRock Group Personal Pension Plan BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Limited (BIM), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, contributes to the BlackRock Group Personal Pension Plan, a defined contribution plan for all employees of BIM. BIM contributes between 6% and 15% of each employees eligible compensation. The expense for this plan was $22 million, $13 million and $16 million for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
F-75 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 16. Employee Benefit Plans (continued) Defined Benefit Plans In 2009, prior to the BGI Transaction, the Company had several defined benefit pension plans in Japan, Germany, Luxembourg and Jersey. All accrued benefits under these defined benefit plans are currently frozen and the plans are closed to new participants. In 2008, the defined benefit pension values in Luxembourg were transferred into a new defined contribution plan for such employees, removing future liabilities. Participant benefits under the plans will not change with salary increases or additional years of service.
Through the BGI Transaction, the Company assumed defined benefit pension plans in Japan and Germany which are closed to new participants. During 2010, these plans merged into the legacy BlackRock plans in Japan (the Japan Plan) and Germany. At December31, 2010 and 2009, the plan assets for these plans were approximately $19 million and $10 million, respectively, and the unfunded obligations were less than $6 million and $3 million, respectively, which were recorded in accrued compensation and benefits on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Benefit payments for the next five years and in aggregate for the five years thereafter are not expected to be material.
Defined benefit plan assets for the Japan Plan of approximately $16 million are invested using a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equity securities, debt securities and other investments are used to preserve asset values, diversify risk and achieve the target investment return benchmark. Investment strategies and asset allocations are based on consideration of plan liabilities and the funded status of the plan. Investment performance and asset allocation are measured and monitored on an ongoing basis. The current target allocations for the plan assets are 45-50% for U.S. and international equity securities, 50-55% for U.S. and international fixed income securities and 0-5% for cash and cash equivalents.
The table below provides the fair value of the defined benefit Japan Plan assets at December31, 2010 by asset category. The table also identifies the level of inputs used to determine the fair value of assets in each category.

Employee Benefit Plans (continued) Defined Benefit Plans (continued) The assets and unfunded obligation for the defined benefit pension plan in Germany and Jersey were immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements at December31, 2010.
Post-retirement Benefit Plans Prior to the BGI Transaction, the Company had requirements to deliver post-retirement medical benefits to a closed population based in the United Kingdom and through the BGI Transaction, the Company assumed a post-retirement benefit plan to a closed population of former BGI employees in the United Kingdom. For the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, expenses and unfunded obligations for these benefits were immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In addition, through the BGI Transaction, the Company assumed a requirement to deliver post-retirement medical benefits to a closed population of former BGI employees in the United States. At December31, 2010 and 2009, the accumulated benefit obligation for this unfunded plan, which is included in accrued compensation and benefits on the consolidated statements of financial condition, was approximately $7 million and $14 million, respectively. For the year ended December31, 2010, expenses for these benefits were immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements. The post-retirement medical plan costs are developed from actuarial valuations that include key assumptions, including the discount rate and health care cost trends. Changes in retiree medical plan benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions, changes in the number of plan participants and increases in the cost of healthcare. Benefit payments for the next five years and in aggregate for the five years thereafter are not expected to be material. The estimated impact of a one percentage-point change in the discount rate would be a change of less than $100 thousand on 2010 pension expense and would change the projected benefit obligation by less than $1 million.

(BTC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is chartered as a national bank whose powers are limited to trust activities. BTC is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal banking agencies.

Under the capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, BTC must meet specific capital guidelines that invoke quantitative measures of BTCs assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under the regulatory accounting practices. BTCs capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.
Quantitative measures established by regulators to ensure capital adequacy require BTC to maintain a minimum Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 leverage ratio, as well as Tier 1 and Total risk-based capital ratios.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 21. Income Taxes (continued) Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded net when related to the same tax jurisdiction. At December31, 2010, the Company recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition deferred income tax assets, within other assets, and deferred income tax liabilities of $10 million and $5,477 million, respectively. At December31, 2009, the Company recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition deferred income tax assets, within other assets, and deferred income tax liabilities of $21 million and $5,571 million, respectively.
The United Kingdom in the third quarter of 2010 and New York City in the third quarter of 2009 enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates, which resulted in a revaluation of certain net deferred income tax liabilities primarily related to acquired intangible assets, which resulted in a $30 million and a $45 million tax benefit, respectively.
The Company had a deferred income tax asset related to unrealized investment losses of approximately $108 million and $155 million as of December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, reflecting the Companys conclusion that based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. During 2008, the Company incurred investment losses of $573 million primarily related to unrealized losses on investments. Substantially all of the investment losses relate to investments held by subsidiaries in the United States. After the allocation of net loss attributable to non-controlling interests of $155 million, the net loss on investments was $418 million. A portion of the net loss is expected to be ordinary if recognized and, as result, will not be subject to any limitations. Realized capital losses may be carried back three years and carried forward five years and offset against realized capital gains for federal income tax purposes. The Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and to generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses.
At December31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had available state net operating loss carry forwards of $182 million and $568 million, respectively, which will expire on or before 2032. As of December31, 2010, the Company had a foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $84 million of which $42 million expires on or before 2017 and the balance will carry forward indefinitely. In addition, at December31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had U.S. capital loss carryforwards of $90 million which were acquired in the BGI Transaction and will expire on or before 2013.
At December31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had $78 million and $71 million of valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets, respectively, recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The year over year increase in the valuation allowance primarily related to certain foreign deferred income tax assets.
Goodwill recorded in connection with the Quellos Transaction has been reduced during the period by the amount of tax benefit realized from tax-deductible goodwill. See Note 11, Goodwill, for further discussion.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 21. Income Taxes (continued) Current income taxes are recorded net in the consolidated statements of financial condition when related to the same tax jurisdiction. As of December31, 2010, the Company had current income taxes receivable and payable of $57 million and $157 million, respectively, recorded in other assets and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, respectively. As of December31, 2009, the Company had current income taxes receivable and payable of $292 million and $86 million, respectively, recorded in other assets and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, respectively.
The Company does not provide deferred taxes on the excess of the financial reporting over tax basis on its investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. The excess totaled $1,297 million and $778 million as of December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The determination of the additional deferred income taxes on the excess has not been provided because it is not practicable due to the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.
Pursuant to the adoption of ASC 740-10 related to uncertainty in income taxes, see the following tabular reconciliation which presents the total amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits: Year ended December31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Balance at January1 $ 285 $ 114 $ 66 Additions for tax positions of prior years 10 11 12 Reductions for tax positions of prior years (17 ) (1 ) (2 ) Additions based on tax positions related to current year 35 63 42 Lapse of statute of limitations (8 )   Settlements (2 ) (16 ) (7 ) Foreign exchange translation  (3 ) 3 Positions assumed in BGI Transaction 4 117  Balance at December31 $ 307 $ 285 $ 114 Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, are $194 million, $184 million and $60 million of tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above, the Company accrued interest and penalties of $8 million during 2010 and in total, as of December31, 2010, has recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $56 million. During 2009, the Company accrued interest and penalties of $8 million and in total, as of December31, 2009, has recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $48 million, of which $28 million was assumed in the BGI Transaction.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 21. Income Taxes (continued) Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company has been indemnified by Barclays for $69 million of unrecognized tax benefits.
BlackRock is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in multiple jurisdictions. The tax years after 2005 remain open to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examination, and the tax years after 2006 remain open to income tax examination in the United Kingdom. With few exceptions, as of December31, 2010, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before 2006. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is currently examining the Companys 2006 and 2007 tax years and management expects that examination to conclude during 2011. In February 2011, the Company received a notice of proposed adjustments from the IRS. Management does not anticipate that its resolution would result in a material change to its consolidated financial statements. The Company is currently under audit in several state and foreign jurisdictions.
As of December31, 2010, it is reasonably possible the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease within the next twelve months due to completion of tax authorities exams or the expiration of statues of limitations. Management estimates that the existing liability for uncertain tax positions could decrease by approximately $15 million to $25 million within the next twelve months. The Company does not anticipate that any possible adjustments resulting from these audits would result in a material change to its consolidated financial statements.
Prior to September29, 2006, BlackRock had filed selected state and municipal income tax returns with one or more PNC subsidiaries on a combined or unitary basis. When BlackRock was included in a groups combined or unitary state or municipal income tax filing with PNC subsidiaries, BlackRocks share of the liability generally was an allocation to BlackRock of a percentage of the total tax liability based upon BlackRocks level of activity in such state or municipality. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows.

At December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, outstanding participating securities were 2.8million, 3.8million and 4.5million, respectively.
Basic EPS is calculated pursuant to the two-class method to determine income attributable to common shareholders. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS includes the determinants of basic EPS and in addition, reflects the impact of other potentially dilutive shares, including RSU awards that do not contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends, unexercised stock options and convertible debentures. The dilutive effect of participating securities is calculated under the more dilutive of either the treasury method or the two-class method.
Due to the similarities in terms between BlackRock series A, B, C and D non-voting participating preferred stock and the Companys common stock, the Company considers the series A, B, C and D non-voting participating preferred stock to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of EPS calculations. As such, the Company has included the outstanding series A, B, C and D non-voting participating preferred stock and dividends paid for these series in the calculation of average basic and diluted shares outstanding for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
