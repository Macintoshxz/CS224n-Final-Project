BUSINESS Overview BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK; BlackRock or the Company) is the worlds largest publicly traded investment management firm with employees in 30 countries that serve clients in over 100 countries across the globe. We provide a broad range of investment and risk management services and had $3.792 trillion of assets under management (AUM) at December31, 2012. Our clients include retail, high net worth (HNW) and institutional investors, comprised of pension funds, official institutions, endowments, insurance companies, corporations, financial institutions, central banks and sovereign wealth funds. The Company is highly regulated and serves its clients as a fiduciary. We do not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of our clients.
Our unique platform enables us to offer active (alpha) investments with index (beta) products and risk management to develop tailored solutions for clients. Our product range includes single- and multi-asset class portfolios investing in equities, fixed income, alternatives and/or money market instruments. We offer our products directly and through intermediaries in a variety of vehicles, including open-end and closed-end mutual funds, iShares  exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other exchange-traded products (together with ETFs, ETPs), collective investment funds and separate accounts. We also offer our BlackRock Solutions  (BRS) investment systems, risk management and advisory services primarily to institutional investors.
BlackRock is an independent, publicly traded company, with no single majority shareholder and a majority of independent directors on its Board of Directors. At December31, 2012, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) owned approximately 20.8% of BlackRocks voting common shares outstanding and approximately 21.9% of total capital stock.
Management seeks to achieve attractive returns for stockholders over time by, among other things, capitalizing on the following factors:  the Companys diversified alpha and beta product offerings, which enhance its ability to offer a variety of traditional and alternative investment products across the risk spectrum and to tailor single- and multi-asset class investment solutions to address specific client needs;  the Companys focus on strong performance providing alpha for active products and limited or no tracking error for passive products;  the Companys longstanding commitment to risk management and the continued development of, and increased interest in, BRS products and services;  the Companys positioning in the face of macro challenges driving trends in investor behavior, including the secular shift to passive investing and ETPs, a focus on income and retirement, and barbelling of risk using passive and high alpha products including alternatives;  the Companys global presence and commitment to best practices around the world, with approximately 45% of employees outside the United States supporting local investment capabilities and serving clients, and approximately 44% of total AUM managed for clients domiciled outside the United States; and  the growing recognition of the global BlackRock brand, and the depth and breadth of the Companys intellectual capital.
BlackRock operates in a global marketplace characterized by a high degree of market volatility and economic uncertainty, factors that can significantly affect earnings and stockholder returns in any given period.
The Companys ability to increase revenue, earnings and stockholder value over time is predicated on its ability to generate new business, including business in BRS products and services. New business efforts are dependent on BlackRocks ability to achieve clients investment objectives in a manner consistent with their risk preferences and to deliver excellent client service. All of these efforts require the commitment and contributions of BlackRock employees. Accordingly, the ability to attract, develop and retain talented professionals is critical to the Companys long-term success.

(2) BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP); however, management believes evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP reported results include certain significant items, the after-tax impact of which management considers non-recurring or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value and, therefore, are excluded in calculating as adjusted results as described below.
As adjusted operating income excluded certain expenses incurred related to the integration of the acquisitions of Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (MLIM), the fund of funds business of Quellos Group, LLC (Quellos) and Barclays Global Investors (BGI), as well as advisory fees, legal fees and consulting transaction expenses related to the acquisition of BGI from Barclays on December1, 2009 (the BGI Transaction), a 2007 termination fee for closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, 2011 and 2012 U.K. lease exit costs, 2008, 2009 and 2011 restructuring charges and a one-time contribution to certain of the Companys bank-managed short-term investment funds (STIFs) in 2012. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (LTIP) funded or to be funded through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC and a Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution has been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of LTIP participants put options, primarily in the three months ended March31, 2007, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. The expense related to the Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution ceased at the end of third quarter 2011. As of first quarter 2012, all of the Merrill Lynch contributions had been received. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded from operating and non-operating income, as adjusted, as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non-operating income (expense).
(3) Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Companys results until future periods. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, substantially offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. In addition, in 2008 and 2007, revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excluded reimbursable property management compensation, which represented compensation and benefits paid to personnel of Metric Property Management, Inc. (Metric), a subsidiary of BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (Realty). Prior to the transfer in 2008 to a third party, these employees were retained on Metrics payroll when certain properties were acquired by Realtys clients. The related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by Realtys clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they did not bear an economic cost to BlackRock.
Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted exclude the after-tax impact of the items listed above and also include the effect on deferred income tax expense attributable to changes in corporate income tax rates as a result of income tax law changes and a state tax election.
(4) Percentage represents compounded annual growth rate.
See reconciliation to GAAP measures in Item7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items.

(1) Amounts include acquisition adjustments and reclassification of certain AUM acquired from BGI in December 2009, Swiss Re Private Equity Partners (SRPEP) in September 2012 and Claymore Investments, Inc. (Claymore) in March 2012 and other reclassifications to conform to current period combined AUM policy and presentation. Amounts also include BGI merger-related outflows due to manager concentration considerations prior to third quarter 2011 and outflows from scientific active equity performance prior to second quarter 2011. As a result of client investment manager concentration limits and the scientific active equity performance, outflows were expected to occur for a period of time subsequent to the close of the transaction.
(2) Percentage represents compounded annual growth rate.
AUM represents the broad ranges of financial assets we manage for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for billing (for example, net asset value). Reported AUM does not include assets for which we provide risk management or other forms of non-discretionary advice, or assets that we are retained to manage on a short-term, temporary basis.
Investment management fees are typically expressed as a percentage of AUM. We also earn performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreed-upon benchmark or return hurdle. On some products, we also may earn securities lending fees. In addition, BlackRock offers its proprietary Aladdin  investment system as well as risk management, outsourcing and advisory services, to institutional investors under the BRS name. Revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions, number of users, accomplishment of specific deliverables or other objectives.
At December31, 2012, total AUM was $3.792 trillion, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 23% over the last five years. AUM growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains, net new business and acquisitions, including BGI, which added approximately $1.844 trillion of AUM in December 2009 and Claymore and SRPEP, which added $13.7 billion of AUM in 2012. These acquisitions significantly changed our AUM mix, from predominantly active fixed income and equity in 2007 to a broadly diversified product range, as described below.
3 Table of Contents The Company considers the categorization of its AUM by product type, investment style, client type and client region useful to understanding its business. The following discussion of the Companys AUM will be organized as follows: Product Client Type Client Region  Equity  Institutional  Americas  Fixed Income  Retail and HNW  Europe,the MiddleEastandAfrica(EMEA)  Multi-Asset  Asia-Pacific  Alternatives  Cash Management  iShares Products Component changes in AUM by product type and investment style for 2012 are presented below.

The remaining AUM was in cash management products and advisory mandates representing long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. Net new business in long-term products totaled $107.7 billion excluding the effect of two large, low-fee non-ETP index fixed income outflows from two institutional clients of $36.0 billion in the first quarter of 2012 and $74.2 billion in the third quarter of 2012. Net inflows in long-term products, excluding these outflows, were augmented by net inflows into cash management products. Long-term and cash product net inflows were offset by advisory distributions due to the successful completion of asset dispositions related to the three Maiden Lane vehicles associated with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, marking the repayment of all senior and junior obligations of the three vehicles and the generation of net gains benefiting the U.S. public.
Long-term product offerings include active and passive (index) strategies. Our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle (alpha) while maintaining an appropriate risk profile. We offer two types of active strategies: those that rely primarily on fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to drive portfolio construction. In contrast, passive strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index (beta), generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index. Passive strategies include both our institutional non-ETP index products and iShares ETPs.
4 Table of Contents Although many clients use both active and passive strategies, the application of these strategies differs greatly. For example, clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class pending reallocation to an active manager. This has the effect of increasing turnover of index AUM. In addition, institutional non-ETP index assignments tend to be very large (multi-billion dollars) and typically reflect low fee rates. This has the potential to exaggerate the significance of net flows in institutional index products on BlackRocks revenues and earnings.
Equity Year-end 2012 equity AUM of $1.845 trillion increased by $285.4 billion, or 18%, from the end of 2011, largely due to flows into regional, country-specific and global mandates and the effect of higher market valuations. Equity AUM growth included $54.0 billion in net new business and $3.6 billion in new assets related to the acquisition of Claymore. Net new business of $54.0 billion was driven by net inflows of $53.0 billion and $19.1 billion into iShares and non-ETP index accounts, respectively. Passive inflows were offset by active net outflows of $18.1 billion, with net outflows of $10.0 billion and $8.1 billion from fundamental and scientific active equity products, respectively.
Passive strategies represented 84% of equity AUM with the remaining 16% in active mandates. Institutional investors represented 62% of equity AUM, while iShares, and retail and HNW represented 29% and 9%, respectively. At year-end 2012, 63% of equity AUM was managed for clients in the Americas (defined as the United States, Caribbean, Canada, Latin America and Iberia) compared with 28% and 9% managed for clients in EMEA and Asia-Pacific, respectively.
BlackRocks effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in AUM mix. Approximately half of BlackRocks equity AUM is tied to international markets, including emerging markets, which tend to have higher fee rates than similar U.S. equity strategies. Accordingly, fluctuations in international equity markets, which do not consistently move in tandem with U.S. markets, may have a greater impact on BlackRocks effective equity fee rates and revenues.
Fixed Income Fixed income AUM ended 2012 at $1.259 trillion, rising $11.6 billion, or 1%, relative to December31, 2011. Growth in AUM reflected $43.3 billion in net new business, excluding the two large previously mentioned low-fee outflows, $75.4 billion in market and foreign exchange gains and $3.0 billion in new assets related to Claymore. Net new business was led by flows into domestic specialty and global bond mandates, with net inflows of $28.8 billion, $13.6 billion and $3.1 billion into iShares , non-ETP index and model-based products, respectively, partially offset by net outflows of $2.2 billion from fundamental strategies.
Fixed Income AUM was split between passive and active strategies with 48% and 52%, respectively. Institutional investors represented 74% of fixed income AUM while iShares and retail and HNW represented 15% and 11%, respectively. At year-end 2012, 59% of fixed income AUM was managed for clients in the Americas compared with 33% and 8% managed for clients in EMEA and Asia-Pacific, respectively.
Multi-Asset Class Component Changes in Multi-Asset Class AUM (Dollar amounts in millions) 12/31/2011 Net New Business Net Acquired Market/FX App (Dep) 12/31/2012 Asset allocation $ 126,067 $ 1,575 $ 78 $ 12,440 $ 140,160 Target date/risk 49,063 14,526  6,295 69,884 Fiduciary 50,040 (284 )  7,948 57,704 Multi-asset $ 225,170 $ 15,817 $ 78 $ 26,683 $ 267,748 Multi-asset class AUM totaled $267.7 billion at year-end 2012, up 19%, or $42.6 billion, reflecting $15.8 billion in net new business and $26.7 billion in portfolio valuation gains. BlackRocks multi-asset class team manages a variety of bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities, currencies, bonds and commodities, and our extensive risk management capabilities. Investment solutions might include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays.
At December31, 2012, institutional investors represented 66% of multi-asset class AUM, while retail and HNW accounted for the remaining AUM. Additionally, 58% of multi-asset class AUM is managed for clients based in the Americas with 37% and 5% managed for clients in EMEA and Asia-Pacific, respectively. Flows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our advice in an increasingly 5 Table of Contents challenging investment environment with $15.0 billion, or 95%, of net inflows coming from institutional clients, with the remaining $0.8 billion, or 5%, generated by retail and HNW clients. Defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows. This client group added $13.1 billion of net new business in 2012. During the year, Americas net inflows of $18.5 billion were partially offset by net outflows of $2.6 billion collectively from EMEA and Asia-Pacific clients.
The Companys multi-asset strategies include the following:  Asset allocation and balanced products represented 52%, or $140.2 billion, of multi-asset class AUM at year-end, up $14.1 billion, with growth in AUM driven by net new business of $1.6 billion and $12.4 billion in market and foreign exchange gains. These strategies combine equity, fixed income and alternative components for investors seeking a tailored solution relative to a specific benchmark and within a risk budget. In certain cases, these strategies seek to minimize downside risk through diversification, derivatives strategies and tactical asset allocation decisions.
Target date and target risk products ended the year at $69.9 billion, up $20.8 billion, or 42%, since December31, 2011. Growth in AUM was driven by net new business of $14.5 billion, a year-over-year organic growth rate of 30%. Institutional investors represented 90% of target date and target risk AUM, with defined contribution plans accounting for over 80% of AUM. The remaining 10% of target date and target risk AUM consisted of retail client investments. Flows were driven by defined contribution investments in our LifePath and LifePath Retirement Income  offerings, which are qualified investment options under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. These products utilize a proprietary asset allocation model that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investors expected retirement timing.
Fiduciary management services accounted for 22%, or $57.7 billion, of multi-asset AUM at December31, 2012 and increased $7.7 billion during the year due to market and foreign exchange gains. These are complex mandates in which pension plan sponsors retain BlackRock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of plan management. These customized services require strong partnership with the clients investment staff and trustees in order to tailor investment strategies to meet client-specific risk budgets and return objectives.
Alternatives Component Changes in Alternatives AUM (Dollar amounts in millions) 12/31/2011 Net New Business Net Acquired Market/FX App(Dep) 12/31/2012 Core $ 63,647 $ (3,922 ) $ 6,166 $ 2,476 $ 68,367 Currency and commodities 41,301 (1,547 ) 860 814 41,428 Alternatives $ 104,948 $ (5,469 ) $ 7,026 $ 3,290 $ 109,795 Alternatives AUM totaled $109.8 billion at year-end 2012, up $4.8 billion, or 5%, reflecting $3.3 billion in portfolio valuation gains and $7.0 billion in new assets related to the acquisitions of SRPEP, which deepened our alternatives footprint in the European and Asian markets, and Claymore. Core alternative outflows of $3.9 billion were driven almost exclusively by return of capital to clients. Currency net outflows of $5.0 billion were partially offset by net inflows of $3.5 billion into iShares commodity funds.
We continued to make significant investments in our alternatives platform as demonstrated by our acquisition of SRPEP, successful closes on the renewable power initiative and our build out of an alternatives retail platform, which now stands at nearly $10.0 billion in AUM.
We believe that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies to best meet their investment objectives, they will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings.
Institutional investors represented 69%, or $75.8 billion, of alternatives AUM with retail and HNW investors comprising an additional 9%, or $9.7 billion, at year-end 2012.
iShares commodity products accounted for the remaining $24.3 billion, or 22%, of AUM at year-end. Alternative clients are geographically diversified with 56%, 26%, and 18% of clients located in the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific, respectively.
The BlackRock Alternative Investors (BAI) group coordinates our alternative investment efforts, including 6 Table of Contents product management, business development and client service. Our alternatives products fall into two main categories  core, which includes hedge funds, funds of funds (hedge funds and private equity) and real estate offerings, and currency and commodities. The products offered under the BAI umbrella are described below.
Core .
Hedge Funds ended the year with $26.6 billion in AUM, down $1.4 billion as net inflows into single-strategy hedge funds of $1.0 billion were more than offset by return of capital on opportunistic funds. Market valuation gains contributed $1.1 billion to AUM growth. Hedge fund AUM includes a variety of single-strategy, multi-strategy, and global macro, as well as portable alpha, distressed and opportunistic offerings. Products include both open-end hedge funds and similar products, and closed-end funds created to take advantage of specific opportunities over a defined, often longer-term investment horizon.
Funds of Funds AUM increased $6.3 billion, or 28%, to $29.1 billion at December31, 2012, including $17.1 billion in funds of hedge funds and hybrid vehicles and $12.0 billion in private equity funds of funds. Growth largely reflected $6.2 billion of assets from SRPEP as we expanded our fund of funds product offerings and further engage in European and Asian markets.
Real Estate and Hard Assets AUM totaled $12.7 billion, down $0.1 billion, or 1%, reflecting $0.6 billion in client net redemptions and distributions and $0.5 billion in portfolio valuation gains. Offerings include high yield debt and core, value-added and opportunistic equity portfolios and renewable power funds. We continued to expand our real estate platform and product offerings with the launch of our first U.S. real estate investment trust (REIT) mutual fund and addition of an infrastructure debt team to further increase and diversify our offerings within global infrastructure investing.
Currency and Commodities.
AUM in currency and commodities strategies totaled $41.4 billion at year-end 2012, flat from year-end 2011, reflecting net outflows of $1.5 billion, primarily from active currency and currency overlays, and $0.8 billion of market and foreign exchange gains. Claymore also contributed $0.9 billion of AUM. Currency and commodities products include a range of active and passive products. Our iShares commodities products represented $24.3 billion of AUM, including $0.7 billion acquired from Claymore, and are not eligible for performance fees.
Cash Management Cash management AUM totaled $263.7 billion at December31, 2012, up $9.1 billion, or 4%, from year-end 2011. Cash management products include taxable and tax-exempt money market funds and customized separate accounts. Portfolios may be denominated in U.S. dollar, Euro or British pound.
At year-end 2012, 84% of cash AUM was managed for institutions and 16% for retail and HNW investors. The investor base was also predominantly in the Americas, with 69% of AUM managed for investors in the Americas and 31% for clients in other regions, mostly EMEA-based. We generated net inflows of $5.0 billion during 2012, reflecting continued uncertainty around future regulatory changes and a challenging investing environment. To meet investor needs, we sought to provide new solutions and choices for our clients by launching short duration products in the United States, which both immediately address the challenge of a continuing low interest rate environment and will also be important investment options should regulatory changes occur. In the EMEA business, and in particular for our Euro product set, we have taken action to ensure that we can provide effective cash management solutions in the face of a potentially negative yield environment by taking steps to launch new products and re-engineer our existing product set.
iShares Our industry-leading U.S. and international iShares ETP suite is discussed below.
Component Changes in AUM  iShares (Dollar amounts in millions) 12/31/2011 Net New Business Net Acquired Market/FX App (Dep) 12/31/2012 Equity $ 419,651 $ 52,973 $ 3,517 $ 58,507 $ 534,648 Fixed income 153,802 28,785 3,026 7,239 192,852 Multi-asset class 562 178 78 51 869 Alternatives 19,341 3,232 701 1,064 24,338 Long-term $ 593,356 $ 85,168 $ 7,322 $ 66,861 $ 752,707 7 Table of Contents The ETP industry experienced a banner year as annual inflow records from 2008 were broken in the United States, the Asia-Pacific region and on a global basis, propelled by exceptional growth in fixed income and emerging markets equity products 1 . The industry saw $260 billion 1 of net new business, representing 17% in organic growth during 2012, with year-end AUM totaling $1.902 trillion 1 .
The global growth of the ETP market reflects both continued adoption and new product introduction with investor product preferences driven to varying degrees by performance (as measured by tracking error, which is the difference between net returns on the ETP and the corresponding targeted index), liquidity (bid-ask spread), tax-efficiency, transparency and client service. Fixed income and emerging markets were drivers of industry growth. Fixed income ETPs globally gathered a record $70 billion of net inflows, $54 billion of which was U.S.-listed, led by investment grade and high yield demand as investors shunned the record low yields of government securities in favor of higher yielding products. Both developed and emerging markets equity ETPs saw strong inflows in 2012 as central banks around the world continued to pump liquidity into the global economy via asset purchase programs and accommodative monetary policy to help spur economic growth. U.S. equity ETPs globally had inflows of $116 billion, $82 billion of which was into U.S.-listed funds, and emerging markets equity ETPs globally had $55 billion of net inflows, $30 billion of which was into U.S.-listed funds.
1 iShares is the leading ETP provider in the world, with $752.7 billion of AUM at December31, 2012, which increased $159.4 billion, or 27%, since year-end 2011.
iShares was the top asset gatherer globally in 2012 1 with $85.2 billion of net inflows for an organic growth rate of 14%, with additional AUM growth of $66.9 billion due to market valuation improvements. During 2012, iShares introduced 85 new ETPs, acquired Claymores 35 ETPs in Canada and continued our dual commitment to innovation and responsible product structuring. Our broad product range offers investors a precise, transparent and low-cost way to tap market returns and gain access to a full range of asset classes and global markets that have been difficult or expensive for many investors to access until now, as well as the liquidity required to make adjustments to their exposures quickly and cost-efficiently.
At year-end, iShares AUM included $534.7 billion, or 71%, in equity offerings, $192.9 billion, or 26%, in fixed income ETPs and $25.2 billion, or 3%, in multi-asset class and alternative investments.
iShares equity AUM increased $115.0 billion, or 27%, from year-end 2011, with $53.0 billion in net inflows and $58.5 billion of market and 1 BlackRock; Bloomberg foreign exchange valuation gains.
iShares fixed income AUM rose $39.1 billion, or 25%, over the previous year, with 74% of the increase being driven by $28.8 billion of net inflows.
iShares multi-asset class and alternatives AUM grew by $5.3 billion, or 27%, with $3.4 billion of net inflows, predominantly into gold commodity products resulting from a macro environment dominated by accommodative monetary policies and resulting currency debasement with an additional $1.1 billion of market and foreign exchange valuation gains.
iShares offers the most diverse product set in the industry with 621 ETPs at year-end 2012 and serves the broadest client base, covering 27 countries on five continents including North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia .
iShares was the ETP leader in asset gathering in 2012 with four of the top ten products and the highest number of leading products as measured by total assets, with five of the top ten 1 . Notwithstanding an increase in the number of ETP products offered in the industry, iShares continued to maintain the largest share of global AUM with 39% at December31, 2012 1 .
U.S. iShares AUM ended at $552.3 billion with $61.0 billion of net inflows driven by strong demand for our yield-oriented and equity dividend products with our flagship emerging markets fund also attracting strong flows in 2012. In the United States, we re-gained the top position for 2012 ETP flows with more than 30% market share, and at year-end 2012, iShares was the largest ETP provider in the United States with 41% share of AUM 1 . During the fourth quarter of 2012, we debuted the core series in the United States, designed to provide the essential building blocks for buy-and-hold investors to use in constructing the core of their portfolio. The core series demonstrated solid early results with four new and six rebranded products covering U.S. and international equities and U.S. fixed income.
International iShares AUM ended at $200.4 billion with robust net new business of $24.2 billion for the year, led by emerging markets equity and corporate fixed income products. In Europe, we captured 80% and 71% of 2012 fixed income and equity net inflows, respectively. At year-end 2012, iShares was the largest European provider with 38% of AUM and 55% of total 2012 industry inflows in the European market 1 .
In addition, we were the largest ETP manager in Latin America with over 85% of AUM at December31, 2012 1 . We continue to look for opportunities to further diversify product offerings in key strategic focus areas including attractive, high-growth markets both organically and 8 Table of Contents through acquisitions as demonstrated by our acquisition of Claymore and our 2013 agreement with Credit Suisse to acquire their ETF business, the closing of which is subject to customary closing conditions.
In general, we expect to maintain relatively stable pricing, so long as it is supported by performance and the iShares value proposition, although we continually seek to achieve efficiencies and pass them on to our clients.
Clients We serve a diverse mix of institutional and retail investors worldwide. Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors; and retail and HNW investors. We also serve both institutional and retail and HNW investors who acquire iShares on exchanges worldwide.
iShares is presented under Products above, with investments in iShares by institutions and retail and HNW clients excluded from figures and discussions in their respective sections below.

Specifically, we organized the client side of our business into two groups: one comprising Retail and iShares and another comprising Institutional and BlackRock Solutions . The separation of the client functions into these two teams allows us to better focus on the unique needs of these client groups by bringing the full capabilities of the firm to bear in an organized, cohesive approach. Additionally, we split our investments functions into five distinct strategies: Alpha, Beta, Multi-Asset, Alternatives and Trading/Liquidity. This new organizational structure allows us to enhance our focus on performance and client engagement.
Institutional Investors (excluding Investments in iShares) Institutional Long-Term AUM by Asset Class, Style& Client Region December31, 2012 (Dollar amounts in millions) Americas EMEA Asia-Pacific Total Active: Equity $ 51,242 $ 54,499 $ 23,283 $ 129,024 Fixed income 336,998 126,530 54,575 518,103 Multi-asset class 77,105 83,797 5,805 166,707 Alternatives 32,362 20,507 17,992 70,861 Index: Equity 580,605 318,862 117,613 1,017,080 Fixed income 132,150 235,875 41,918 409,943 Multi-asset class 950 4,434 4,161 9,545 Alternatives 1,464 3,325 123 4,912 Long-term institutional $ 1,212,876 $ 847,829 $ 265,470 $ 2,326,175 9 Table of Contents Long-term assets managed for institutional investors totaled $2.326 trillion, or 61%, of total AUM at year-end 2012. During the year, net outflows in long-term products totaled $99.2 billion, which includes two large low-fee non-ETP index fixed income outflows from two institutional clients totaling $110.2 billion. Excluding these outflows, long-term net new business from institutional clients totaled $11.0 billion with investment performance, market appreciation and foreign exchange valuation gains contributing $237.9 billion to AUM growth.
BlackRocks institutional AUM is well diversified by both product and region, with 49% of long-term AUM in equities, 40% in fixed income, 8% in multi-asset class and 3% in alternatives. We serve institutional investors on six continents, with 52% of long-term AUM managed on behalf of investors in the Americas, 37% in EMEA and 11% in Asia-Pacific. Institutional AUM is further diversified by investment style and by sub-categories: pensions, endowments and foundations, official institutions, and financial institutions, as described below.
The mix by investment style was 38% active and 62% passive (excluding institutional investors in iShares ). As noted earlier, non-ETP index accounts tend to be larger institutional mandates managed for relatively low fee rates and subject to higher turnover.
A discussion of the Companys Institutional AUM is presented below: Institutional active AUM ended the quarter at $884.7 billion, up $53.4 billion, or 6%, since year-end 2011, earning base fees of $1.8 billion. Institutional active represented 25% of long-term firm AUM and 23% of long-term base fees. Growth in AUM included market and investment performance gains of $71.3 billion and continued strength in multi-asset class products with net inflows of $12.3 billion largely into defined contribution plans, target date and asset allocation offerings. Multi-asset net inflows were offset by equity net outflows of $14.1 billion, which were split between active fundamental and scientific active equity, and fixed income net outflows of $15.1 billion, reflecting outflows from U.S. core and local currency mandates.Core alternatives net outflows were $0.3 billion, excluding $3.9 billion of return of capital.
Institutional non-ETP index AUM totaled $1.441 trillion at December31, 2012, reflecting net outflows of $75.1 billion, which included two large low-fee fixed income outflows from two clients of $36.0 billion and $74.2 billion. Excluding these outflows, net new business was $35.0 billion, with market and foreign exchange valuation gains contributing $166.6 billion to AUM growth. The shift to passive strategies has proven to be a significant and long-term trend in the industry. Flows were led by equities with net inflows of $20.5billion with flows primarily into global mandates as clients increasingly looked to use passive vehicles for macro exposure as they modestly re-risked. In 2012, institutional non-ETP index equity AUM crossed the $1 trillion threshold. Excluding the two previously mentioned outflows, fixed income garnered net inflows of $13.6 billion, led by flows into U.S. sector specialty and global bond mandates. While institutional non-ETP index represented 41% of long-term firm AUM, it accounted for 11% of long-term base fees.
The Companys institutional clients consist of the following:  Pensions, Endowments and Foundations.
BlackRock is among the largest managers of pension plan assets in the world with $1.542 trillion, or 66%, of long-term institutional AUM managed for defined benefit, defined contribution and other pension plans for corporations, governments and unions at December31, 2012. Retirement is a key theme as longevity, aging populations and changing demographics worldwide are driving investment decisions. The market landscape is shifting from defined benefit to defined contribution, driving strong flows in our defined contribution channel, which had $28.4 billion of long-term net inflows for the year, or 9% organic growth. Defined contribution net inflows were led by $13.1 billion into multi-asset class products, with our LifePath target date suite serving as a key component of our retirement solutions. We ended 2012 with $404.9 billion in defined contribution AUM and remain well positioned to capitalize on the on-going evolution of the defined contribution market and demand for outcome-oriented investments. An additional $58.1 billion was managed for other tax-exempt investors, including charities, foundations and endowments.
Official Institutions.
We also managed $171.2 billion, or 7%, of long-term institutional AUM, for official institutions, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals, multilateral entities and government ministries and agencies at year-end 2012. This specialty client group flourished with long-term net new business of $24.5 billion for the year. These clients often require specialized investment policy advice, the use of customized benchmarks and training support.
Financial Institutions.
BlackRock is a top independent manager of assets for insurance companies, which accounted for $226.6 billion, or 10%, of institutional long-term AUM at year-end 2012. Assets managed for other taxable institutions, including corporations, banks and third-party fund sponsors for which we provide sub-advisory services, totaled $328.2 billion, or 14%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end.
10 Table of Contents Retail and HNW Investors (Excluding Investments in iShares) Retail / HNW Long-Term AUM by Asset Class& Client Region December31, 2012 (Dollar amounts in millions) Americas EMEA Asia-Pacific Total Equity $ 94,805 $ 53,140 $ 16,803 $ 164,748 Fixed income 121,640 11,444 5,341 138,425 Multi-asset class 76,714 9,538 4,374 90,626 Alternatives 4,865 3,577 1,243 9,685 Long-term retail/HNW $ 298,024 $ 77,699 $ 27,761 $ 403,484 BlackRock serves retail and HNW investors globally through separate accounts, open-end and closed-end funds, unit trusts and private investment funds. At December31, 2012, long-term assets managed for retail and HNW investors totaled $403.5 billion, up 11%, or $40.1billion, versus year-end 2011. During the year, net inflows of $11.6 billion in long-term products were augmented by market valuation improvements of $28.3 billion.
Retail and HNW investors are served principally through intermediaries, including broker-dealers, banks, trust companies, insurance companies and independent financial advisors. Clients invest primarily in mutual funds, which totaled $322.4 billion, or 80%, of retail and HNW long-term AUM at year-end, with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts. The product mix is well diversified, with 41% of long-term AUM in equities, 34% in fixed income, 23% in multi-asset class and 2% in alternatives. The vast majority (98%)of long-term AUM is invested in active products, although this is partially inflated by the fact that iShares is shown separately, since we do not identify all of the underlying investors.
The client base is also diversified geographically, with 74% of long-term AUM managed for investors based in the Americas, 19% in EMEA and 7% in Asia-Pacific at year-end 2012.
U.S. retail and HNW long-term inflows of $9.8 billion were driven by strong demand for U.S. sector-specialty and municipal fixed income mutual fund offerings and income-oriented equity. In 2012, we broadened the distribution of alternatives funds to bring higher alpha, institutional quality hedge fund products to retail investors as three mutual funds launched at the end of 2011 gained traction and acceptance, raising close to $0.8 billion of assets. U.S. retail alternatives AUM crossed the $5.0 billion threshold in 2012. The year also included the launch of the BlackRock Municipal Target Term Trust (BTT) with $2.1 billion of assets raised, making it the largest municipal fund ever launched and the largest overall industry offering since 2007. We are the leading U.S. manager by AUM of separately managed accounts, the second largest closed-end fund manager and a top-ten manager of long-term open-end mutual funds 2 .
International retail net inflows of $1.8 billion in 2012 were driven by fixed income net inflows of $5.2 billion. Investor demand remained distinctly risk-off in 2012, largely driven by macro political and economic instability and continued trends toward de-risking. Equity net outflows of $2.9 billion were predominantly from sector-specific and regional and country-specific equity strategies due to uncertainty in European markets. Our international retail and HNW offerings include our Luxembourg cross-border fund families, BlackRock Global Funds (BGF), BlackRock Strategic Funds with $83.1 billion and $2.4 billion of AUM at year-end 2012, respectively, and a range of retail funds in the United Kingdom. BGF contained 67funds registered in 35 jurisdictions at year-end 2012. Over 60% of the funds were rated by S&P. In 2012, we were ranked as the third largest cross border fund provider 3 . In the United Kingdom, we ranked among the five largest fund managers 3 , and are known for our innovative product offerings, especially within natural resources, European equity, Asian equity and equity income.
Global Clientele Our footprint in each of these regions reflects strong relationships with intermediaries and an established ability to deliver our global investment expertise in funds and other products tailored to local regulations and requirements.
2 Simfund, Cerulli 3 Lipper FERI 11 Table of Contents Americas .
At year-end 2012, assets managed on behalf of clients domiciled in the Americas totaled $2.326 trillion, or 61%, of total AUM, up $203.0 billion, or 10%, since year-end 2011. Net new business in long-term products of $69.8 billion and in cash management of $1.9 billion was offset by planned advisory distributions of $72.4 billion, primarily due to the successful completion of asset dispositions related to the Maiden Lane vehicles. Market valuation gains contributed an additional $195.7 billion to AUM growth. During the year, we served clients through offices in 30 states in the United States as well as Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Spain.
EMEA.
AUM for clients based in EMEA ended the year at $1.158 trillion, or 31%, of total AUM, an increase of $131.3 billion from year-end 2011. During the year, clients awarded net new business of $9.0 billion, including inflows from investors in 22 countries across the region. In the first quarter 2012, flows were impacted by one $36.0 billion low-fee institutional index fixed income redemption from a single client relating to the clients decision to insource. Excluding this redemption, EMEA net new business was $45.0 billion, led by equity net inflows of $32.7 billion as clients slowly began to re-risk in the face of improving confidence in European markets. Our offerings include fund families in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg and Dublin and iShares listed on stock exchanges throughout Europe as well as separate accounts and pooled investment products.
Asia-Pacific .
Clients in the Asia-Pacific region are served through offices in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Korea, and joint ventures in China and India. At December31, 2012, we managed $306.8 billion of AUM for clients in the region, a decrease of 15%, or $55.4 billion, from year-end 2011. Net outflows of $80.3 billion included one large low-fee institutional index fixed income redemption. Market and investment performance were favorable with $24.9 billion of gains.

Product Performance Notes.
Past performance is not indicative of future results. The performance information shown is based on preliminarily available data. The performance information for actively managed accounts reflects U.S. open-end and closed-end mutual funds and similar EMEA-based products with respect to peer median comparisons, and actively managed institutional and HNW separate accounts and funds located globally with respect to benchmark comparisons, as determined using objectively based internal parameters, using the most current verified information available as of December31, 2012.
Accounts terminated prior to December31, 2012 are not included. In addition, accounts that have not been verified as of January29, 2013 have not been included. If such terminated and other accounts had been included, the performance information may have differed substantially from that shown. The performance information does not include funds or accounts that are not measured against a benchmark, any benchmark-based alternatives product, private equity products, CDOs, or liquidation accounts managed by BlackRocks FMA group. Comparisons are based on gross-of-fee performance for U.S. retail, institutional and HNW separate accounts and EMEA institutional separate accounts and net-of-fee performance for EMEA based retail products. The performance tracking information for institutional non-ETP index accounts is based on gross-of-fee performance 12 Table of Contents as of December31, 2012, and includes all institutional accounts and all iShares funds globally using an index strategy. AUM information is based on AUM for each account or fund in the asset class shown without adjustment for overlapping management of the same account or fund as of December31, 2012. The information reported may differ slightly from that reported previously due to the increased number of accounts that have been verified since the last performance disclosure. BlackRock considers these differences to be not material.
The source of performance information and peer medians is BlackRock and is based in part on data from Lipper Inc. for U.S. funds and Morningstar, Inc. for non-U.S. funds. Fund performance reflects the reinvestment of dividends and distributions, but does not reflect sales charges.
BlackRock Solutions BlackRock Solutions offers investment management technology systems, risk management services and advisory services on a fee basis. At December31, 2012, approximately $13.7 trillion of positions were processed on our Aladdin proprietary technology platform, which serves as the investment system for both BlackRock and a growing number of sophisticated institutional investors around the world. BRS also offers comprehensive risk reporting capabilities via the Green Package  and risk management advisory services; interactive fixed income analytics through our web-based calculator, AnSer  ; middle and back office outsourcing services; and investment accounting. BRS Financial Markets Advisory (FMA) group provides services such as valuation and risk assessment of illiquid assets, portfolio restructuring, workouts and dispositions of distressed assets and financial and balance sheet strategies, for a wide range of global clients.
In the face of increasing regulatory scrutiny, clients have increased their focus on risk management and demand for BRS services continues to be robust. During 2012, BRS added 43 net new assignments and ended the year with record revenues of $518 million. At year-end, BRS served 169 clients, including banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers and other institutional investors across North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.
Our Aladdin business posted strong annual growth of 16%. In 2012, we added $3.5 trillion in new assets to the Aladdin platform with the addition of 16 clients and expansion of 10 existing client mandates. We now have 51 Aladdin clients and $14 trillion of assets on the platform with the average size of the Aladdin client growing substantially in the last year.
Aladdin assignments are long-term contracts that provide significant levels of recurring revenue.
In FMA, the nature of assignments is shifting to longer-term advisory and risk monitoring engagements. Advisory AUM decreased 62% to $45.5 billion, driven by $74.5 billion of planned client distributions reflecting our continued success in disposing of assets for clients at, or above, targeted levels.
Securities Lending Securities lending, which is offered as a potential source of incremental returns on long-term portfolios, is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk management. The cash management team invests the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios. Fees for securities lending can be structured as a share of earnings and/or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral. The value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned is captured in the corresponding asset class being managed. The value of the collateral is not included in AUM.
Outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately $134 billion, up from $122 billion at year-end 2011. Spreads were approximately flat compared to 2011, as lending premiums increased and offset declining cash reinvestment spreads. The proportion of securities commanding premium lending fees grew slowly through the year, and started 2012 above the 2011 average.
BlackRock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality, liquidity and superior client service through all market cycles. Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. BlackRocks Cash Management Risk Committee has established risk limits, such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits, across many of the products BlackRock manages, including over all of its cash management products. In the ordinary course of our business, there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed. No such instances, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to the Company. To the extent that daily evaluation/reporting of the profile of the portfolios identifies that a limit has been exceeded, the relevant portfolio will be adjusted. To the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit, the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team, which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers. While a risk limit may be waived, such temporary waivers are infrequent.
13 Table of Contents Risk& Quantitative Analysis Across all asset classes, in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams, the Risk& Quantitative Analysis (RQA) group at BlackRock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and third-party data to identify, measure and manage a wide range of risks. RQA provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes, identifies and helps manage counterparty and operational risks, coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk management-related analytical and information requirements. Where appropriate, RQA will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics.
Competition BlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products, investment style and discipline, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service. These factors may place BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage and there can be no assurance that the Companys strategies and efforts to maintain its existing AUM and to attract new business will be successful.
Geographic Information At December31, 2012, BlackRock had clients in over 100 countries across the globe, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan.

Employees At December31, 2012, BlackRock had a total of approximately 10,500 employees, including approximately 4,800 located in offices outside the United States. Consistent with our commitment to continually expand and enhance our talent base to support our clients, we added approximately 400 employees during the year, including in strategic focus areas such as business operations, Aladdin applications development, iShares , alternatives, institutional sales and Asia.
Regulation Virtually all aspects of BlackRocks business are subject to various laws and regulations both in and outside the United States, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, investors in registered and unregistered investment companies, trust customers of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (BTC), PNC and its bank subsidiaries and their customers, and the financial system. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and financial and bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, such as BlackRock and its subsidiaries, have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations, censures and fines. The rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report.
14 Table of Contents Regulatory Reform In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the DFA) was signed into law in the United States. The DFA is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions in order to be fully implemented. The continued adoption of these regulations and decisions will in large measure determine the impact of the DFA on BlackRock and other financial services firms. The DFA may significantly change BlackRocks operating environment and the financial markets in general in unpredictable ways. It is not possible to predict the ultimate effects that the DFA, or subsequent implementing regulations and decisions, will have upon BlackRocks business, financial condition, and results of operations. Among the potential impacts, provisions of the DFA referred to as the Volcker Rule could, to the extent the final Volcker Rule is determined to apply to BlackRocks activities, affect the extent to which BlackRock invests in and transacts with certain of its investment funds, including private equity funds, hedge funds and fund of funds platforms. The impact of the Volcker Rule on liquidity and pricing in the broader financial markets is unknown at this time. For a further discussion of the Volcker Rule, see Item 1A  Risk Factors  Legal and Regulatory Risks. In addition, BlackRock could be designated a systemically important financial institution (SIFI) and become subject to direct supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve). If BlackRock were designated a SIFI, it could be subject to enhanced prudential, supervisory and other requirements, such as risk-based capital requirements; leverage limits; liquidity requirements; resolution plan and credit exposure report requirements; concentration limits; a contingent capital requirement; enhanced public disclosures; short-term debt limits; and overall risk management requirements. Further, new regulations under the DFA, relating to regulation of swaps and derivatives, will impact the manner by which BlackRock and BlackRock-advised funds and accounts use and trade swaps and other derivatives, and may significantly increase the costs of derivatives trading. Similarly, BlackRocks management of funds and accounts that use and trade swaps and derivatives could be adversely impacted by recently adopted changes to the Commodity Futures Trading Commissions (the CFTC) regulations. These rule changes include those concerning, among other things, the registration and regulation of commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors (and the accompanying registration and regulation of such entities by the National Futures Association (the NFA)), the registration status of dealer counterparties and other counterparties who are major participants in the swap markets, and requirements concerning mandatory clearing of certain swap transactions. Jurisdictions outside the United States in which BlackRock operates are also in the process of devising or considering more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry, which could have a similar impact on BlackRock and the broader markets.
The DFA and its regulations, and other new laws or regulations, or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRocks business activities; require BlackRock to change certain business practices; divert managements time and attention from BlackRocks business activities to compliance activities; and expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and tax costs) and liabilities, as well as reputational harm. For example, in addition to regulatory changes mandated by the DFA, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) continues to review the role of and risks related to, money market funds and has indicated that it may adopt additional regulations. Some of the proposed changes, if adopted, could significantly alter money market fund products and the entire money market fund industry. In 2012, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States (the OCC) amended the regulations governing bank-maintained short-term investment funds (STIFs) to include new disclosure requirements regarding portfolio holdings and to more closely align portfolio limitations, such as maximum weighted average maturity and weighted average life, with those applicable to SEC registered money market funds. Similarly, the SEC continues to review the distribution fees paid to mutual fund distributors under Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act), which are important to a number of the mutual funds BlackRock manages. Any changes to 12b-1 fees would alter the way BlackRocks distribution partners distribute BlackRock products. Additionally, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the CFTC each continue to review the use of futures and derivatives by mutual funds, and such reviews could result in regulations that further limit the use of futures and derivatives by mutual funds. If adopted, these limitations could require BlackRock to change certain mutual fund business practices or to register additional entities with the CFTC, which could result in additional costs and/or restrictions. In addition, BlackRock has begun reporting certain information about a number of its private funds to the SEC and certain information about a number of its commodity pools to the CFTC, pursuant to systemic risk reporting requirements adopted by both agencies, which have required, and will continue to require, investments in people and systems to assure timely and accurate reporting. Still another example of changes in the regulatory landscape was the IRS implementation of Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). FATCAwas enacted in 2010 and is intended to address taxcompliance issues associated with U.S. taxpayers withforeign accounts. FATCA requires foreign 15 Table of Contents financial institutions to report to the IRS information about financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayers and imposes withholding, documentation and reporting requirements on foreign financial institutions. Final regulations were issued by the IRS on January17, 2013, with the earliest effective dates beginning in January1, 2014. In many instances, however, the precise nature of what needs to be implemented will be governed by bilateral Intergovernmental Agreements (IGAs) between the United States and the countries in which BlackRock does business. Many of these IGAs have yet to be concluded. FATCA could cause the Company to incur significant administrative and compliance costs and subject clients to U.S. tax withholding.
An example of changes in the regulatory landscape in Europe is the European Union (EU) Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), which became effective on July21, 2011 and is required to be implemented by EU member states by July22, 2013. The AIFMD regulates managers of, and service providers to, a broad range of alternative investment funds (AIFs) domiciled within and (depending on the precise circumstances) outside the EU. The AIFMD also regulates the marketing of all AIFs inside the European Economic Area (the EEA). In general, the AIFMD is expected to have a staged implementation between mid-2013 and 2018. Compliance with the AIFMDs requirements may restrict AIF marketing and will place additional compliance and disclosure obligations regarding remuneration, capital requirements, leverage, valuation, stakes in EU companies, depositaries, the domicile of custodians and liquidity management.
Globally, regulators are examining the potential risks in ETFs and may impose additional regulations on ETFs, including requirements to promote increased transparency and to limit the ability of ETFs to utilize derivatives. The International Organization of Securities Commissions is also examining the appropriate level of regulatory oversight of financial benchmarks, whether standards should apply to methodologies for benchmark calculation, and transparency and governance issues in the benchmarking process. Any of these regulatory changes could also lead to business disruptions, could materially and adversely impact the value of assets in which BlackRock has invested directly and/or on behalf of clients, and, to the extent the regulations strictly control the activities of financial services firms, could make it more difficult for BlackRock to conduct certain businesses or distinguish itself from competitors.
Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by regulators and self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations may directly affect the method of operation and profitability of BlackRock. BlackRocks profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce. See the Non-U.S. Regulation section below for a further discussion of regulatory reforms being considered and/or adopted outside of the United States.
U.S. Regulation BlackRock and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries are subject to regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the Department of Labor (the DOL), the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the NFA, the CFTC and other government agencies and regulatory bodies. Certain of BlackRocks U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering regulations and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by various agencies.
The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act), imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as BlackRock, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as BlackRock. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment advisers registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.
BlackRocks trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), as well as the rules of various U.S. and non-U.S. securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g., short sale limits, volume limitations, reporting obligations) and market regulation policies in the United States and globally. Depending on the scope of the rules to be adopted by the SEC, provisions added to the Exchange Act by the DFA may require certain BlackRock subsidiaries to register as municipal advisors in relation to their services for state 16 Table of Contents and local governments, pension plans and other investment programs, such as college savings plans. In addition, BlackRock manages a variety of investment funds listed on U.S. and non-U.S. exchanges, which are subject to the rules of such exchanges. Violation of these laws and regulations could result in restrictions on the Companys activities and damage its reputation.
BlackRock manages a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds, CDOs, real estate funds, collective investment trusts, managed futures funds and hybrid funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the investment community and the public, increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities, record-keeping and reporting, the scope of anti-fraud protections, safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters. BlackRock may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation, rule-making or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators.
Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the DOL, insofar as they act as a fiduciary under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require BlackRock to carry bonds ensuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to non-benefit plan clients.
BlackRock has seven subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators (CPOs) and/or commodity trading advisors with the CFTC and are members of the NFA. Additional BlackRock entities may need to register as a CPO or commodity trading advisor as a result of recently enacted regulatory changes by the CFTC. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments, including swaps as a result of the DFA, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. Three of BlackRocks other subsidiaries, BlackRock Investments, LLC (BRIL), BlackRock Capital Markets, LLC and BlackRock Execution Services, are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealers permitted activities. BRIL is also an approved person with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and a member of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) subject to MSRB rules.
U.S. Banking Regulation PNC is a bank holding company and regulated as a financial holding company by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the BHC Act). Based on PNCs interests in and relationships with BlackRock, BlackRock is deemed to be a non-bank subsidiary of PNC and is therefore subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve and to most banking laws, regulations and orders that apply to PNC, including the Volcker Rule. The supervision and regulation of PNC and its subsidiaries under applicable banking laws is intended primarily for the protection of its banking subsidiaries, its depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the financial system as a whole, rather than for the protection of stockholders, creditors or clients of PNC or BlackRock. PNCs relationships and good standing with its regulators are important to the conduct of BlackRocks business. BlackRock may also be subject to foreign banking laws and supervision that could affect its business.
BTC is a limited purpose national trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and is a member of the Federal Reserve System. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as capital adequacy, regulations governing fiduciaries, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. BTC is also subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTCs customers and not BTC, BlackRock and its affiliates, or BlackRocks stockholders.
BlackRock generally may conduct only activities that are authorized for a financial holding company under the BHC Act. Investment management is an authorized activity, but must be conducted within applicable regulatory requirements, which in some cases are more restrictive than those BlackRock faces under applicable securities laws. BlackRock may also invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which it provides advisory, administrative or other services, only to the extent consistent with applicable law and regulatory 17 Table of Contents interpretations. The Federal Reserve has broad powers to approve, deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices for BlackRock to conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses or assets, or reconfigure existing operations. There are limits on the ability of bank subsidiaries of PNC to extend credit to or conduct other transactions with BlackRock or its funds. PNC and its subsidiaries are also subject to examination by various banking regulators, which results in examination reports and ratings that may adversely impact the conduct and growth of BlackRocks businesses.
The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over BlackRock, including the power to prohibit BlackRock from conducting any activity that, in the Federal Reserves opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting BlackRocks business. The Federal Reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of applicable banking laws, regulations and orders. The DFA strengthened the Federal Reserves supervisory and enforcement authority over a bank holding companys non-bank affiliates, such as BlackRock.
Any failure of PNC to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain BlackRock activities and its growth. Such a change of status could be caused by any failure of one of PNCs bank subsidiaries to remain well capitalized, by any examination downgrade of one of PNCs bank subsidiaries, or by any failure of one of PNCs bank subsidiaries to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. In addition, the DFA broadened the requirements for maintaining financial holding company status by also requiring the holding company to remain well capitalized and well managed.
Non-U.S. Regulation BlackRocks international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. regulatory agencies and bodies and, in certain cases, are affected by U.S. laws and regulations that have extra-territorial application. As BlackRock continues to expand its international presence, a number of its subsidiaries and international operations have become subject to regulatory frameworks comparable to those affecting its operations in the United States.
The Financial Services Authority (the FSA) currently regulates certain BlackRock subsidiaries in the United Kingdom. Authorization by the FSA is required to conduct any financial services related business in the United Kingdom under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FSAs rules made under that Act govern a firms capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients, and systems and controls. The FSA also supervises the Companys U.K.-regulated subsidiaries under a close and continuous regime  which include regular visits and meetings with senior management and control functions  to monitor the Companys compliance with regulatory requirements. Breaches of the FSAs rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against the Companys U.K.-regulated subsidiaries. In April 2013, the FSA is expected to be replaced by Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority. Pending formal implementation, the FSA has introduced a shadow internal structure in anticipation of the creation of the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority, and the Bank of England has created an interim Financial Policy Committee.
In addition to the above, the Companys U.K.-regulated subsidiaries and other European subsidiaries and branches, must comply with the pan-European regulatory regime established by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), which became effective on November1, 2007 and regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the EEA, as well as the Capital Requirements Directive, which delineates regulatory capital requirements. MiFID sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. It also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements.
The United Kingdom has adopted the MiFID rules into national legislation and FSA regulations, as have those other European jurisdictions in which BlackRock has a presence (excluding Switzerland which is not part of the EU or EEA). A review of MiFID by the European Commission has led to the publication of a draft amendment Directive and a draft new Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation. The proposals, if implemented, are likely to result in changes to pre- and post-trade reporting obligations and an expansion of the types of instruments subject to these requirements. They may affect the buying and selling of derivatives by moving most derivative trading onto regulated trading venues and may control the activities of algorithmic trading. The proposals may also result in changes to conduct of business requirements including selling practices, intermediary inducements and client categorization. The proposals also envisage giving the European Commission power to ban certain products and services. A further European Commission Regulation, the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), was adopted in August 2012, and requires the central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives and the mandatory reporting of all derivative contracts. Some of the EMIR technical standards have recently been finalized and the remainder are expected to be finalized in 2013.
18 Table of Contents In addition, the FSA has finalized rules relating to its retail distribution review. These rules, which came into effect on December31, 2012, have changed how retail clients pay for investment advice given in respect of all retail investment products, including open-end and closed-end funds, structured products and insurance-based savings products. The FSA is also considering further rules that would ban payments by product providers to distribution platforms for both advised and non-advised business.
In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the European Commission set out a detailed plan for EU financial reform, outlining a number of initiatives to be reflected in new or updated directives, regulations and recommendations of which the MiFID review (mentioned above) was a part. These, together with the changes contemplated by the AIFMD (mentioned above), will have direct and indirect effects on BlackRocks operations in the EEA.
The European Commission has also published proposals to replace the Market Abuse Directive with a regulation on insider dealing and market manipulation and with an accompanying directive on criminal sanctions. There are also ongoing plans to reform the framework to which regulated firms are subject, including in relation to regulatory capital and the protection of client assets, which will have a direct effect on some of BlackRocks European operations.
The next iteration of the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive (UCITS IV), was required to be adopted in the national law of each EU member state by July1, 2011. The United Kingdom has adopted UCITS IV requirements into national legislation and FSA regulation. Luxembourg and Ireland have also adopted UCITS IV into their national legislation. However, several other EU member states are still in various stages of the adoption process. UCITS IV introduced new requirements including a requirement on UCITS funds to provide a key investor information document. There are also European Commission consultations in process that are intended to improve retail investor protection, including UCITS V, which addresses, among other items, custodial liability, and UCITS VI, which includes proposals on depositaries, money market funds and product management.
Proposals on packaged retail investment products (PRIPs) are to be implemented through the strengthening of MiFID standards (for non-insurance PRIPs), revisions to the Insurance Mediation Directives selling standard (for all insurance-based PRIPs) and new investor disclosure requirements for all PRIPs though a separate EU legislative process.
Certain individual EU Member States, such as France and Italy, have enacted national financial transaction taxes (FTTs), and a group of Member States also could adopt an FTT under an EU Enhanced Cooperation procedure that would apply only in those Member States. In general, any tax on securities and derivatives transactions would likely have a negative impact on the liquidity of the securities and derivatives markets, could diminish the attractiveness of certain types of products that we manage in those countries and could cause clients to shift assets away from such products. An FTT could significantly increase the operational costs of our entering into, on behalf of our clients, securities and derivatives transactions that would be subjected to an FTT, which would adversely impact our revenues.
For the insurance sector the Solvency II process will increase the amount of capital that insurers will have to set aside and will have an indirect effect on fund managers with insurance clients. The Solvency II process has been delayed from an original compliance date of January1, 2014; no new timetable has been currently proposed.
In addition to the FSA, the activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices are overseen by financial services regulators in Germany, The Netherlands, Ireland, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Isle of Man, Jersey, France, Belgium, Italy, Poland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. Regulators in these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant or cancel required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements. Other BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices are regulated in Japan, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, India, Dubai, Cayman Islands, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Canada.
In Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (the FIEL) and the Law Concerning Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the JFSA), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEL.
19 Table of Contents In Australia, BlackRocks subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). ASIC regulates companies and financial services in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection. APRA is the prudential regulator of the Australian financial services industry and oversees banks, credit unions, building societies, general insurance and reinsurance companies, life insurance, friendly societies and most members of the superannuation (pension) industry. Failure to comply with applicable law and regulations could result in the cancellation, suspension or variation of the regulated subsidiaries licenses in Australia.
The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (the SFO) which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of intermediaries. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (the SFC). The SFC is also empowered under the SFO to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. The relevant BlackRock subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC from time to time. Failure to comply with the applicable laws, regulations, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC could result in the suspension or revocations of the licenses granted by the SFC.
There are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many other non-U.S. jurisdictions where BlackRocks subsidiaries are authorized to conduct business.
Available Information BlackRock files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and all amendments to these reports and other information with the SEC.

Item1A.
RISK FACTORS As a leading investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of BlackRocks business. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. While BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market and operating risks, BlackRocks business, financial condition, operating results or non-operating results could be materially adversely affected, or the Companys stock price could decline as a result of any of the following risks.
Risks Related to BlackRocks Business and Competition Changes in the value levels of the capital, commodities or currency markets or other asset classes could lead to a decline in revenues and earnings.
BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns earned on AUM. Movements in equity, debt, commodity, real estate or alternative investment market prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates could cause:  the value of AUM to decrease;  the returns realized on AUM to decrease; 20 Table of Contents  clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive offer greater opportunity that BlackRock may not serve;  clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that it may not manage;  clients to rebalance assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees; and  an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill.
The occurrence of any of these events could result in lower investment advisory, administration and performance fees or earnings and cause the Companys stock price to decline.
Poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues and earnings.
The Companys management believes that investment performance, including the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products, is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of AUM. Poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks or to competitors could reduce revenues and cause earnings to decline as a result of:  existing clients withdrawing funds in favor of better performing products, which could result in lower investment advisory and administration fees;  the diminishing ability to attract funds from existing and new clients;  the Company earning minimal or no performance fees; and  an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill.
The determination to provide support to particular products from time to time or provide securities lending indemnifications may reduce earnings or other investments in the business.
BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time support investment products through capital or credit support. Such support and indemnifications utilize capital that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. Losses or prohibitions on such support and indemnifications, or failure to have or devote sufficient capital to support products and securities lending, could have an adverse impact on revenues and earnings.
On behalf of certain clients, BlackRock lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrowers failure to fulfill its obligations should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrowers obligations under the securities lending agreement. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested. The amount of securities on loan as of December31, 2012 and subject to indemnification was $99.5 billion. BlackRock held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $104.8 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December31, 2012. BlackRock expects indemnified balances to increase over time.
While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrowers obligations to return securities borrowed in the event of a borrower default, BlackRock can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill obligations to a client for whom BlackRock has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall, which could result in additional costs to BlackRock that cannot be estimated with certainty at this time.
Changes in the value levels of the capital markets or other asset classes could lead to a decline in the value of investments that BlackRock owns.
At December31, 2012, BlackRocks net economic investment exposure of approximately $1.2 billion in its investments (see Item7A  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk) primarily resulted from co-investments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds. A decline in the prices of equity or debt securities, or the value of real estate or other alternative investments within or outside the United States could lower the value of these investments and result in a decline of non-operating income and an increase in the volatility of BlackRocks earnings.
Continued capital losses on investments could have adverse income tax consequences.
The Company may generate realized and unrealized capital losses on seed investments and co-investments.
21 Table of Contents Realized capital losses may be carried back three years and carried forward five years and offset against realized capital gains for federal income tax purposes. The Company has unrealized capital losses for which a deferred tax asset has been established. In the event such unrealized losses are realized, the Company may not be able to offset such losses within the carryback or carryforward period or from future realized capital gains, in which case the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The failure to utilize the deferred tax asset could materially increase BlackRocks income tax expense.
The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect BlackRock.
Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. BlackRock, and the products and accounts that it manages, have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, clearing organizations, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose BlackRock or the funds and accounts that it manages to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client. While BlackRock regularly conducts assessments of such risk posed by its counterparties, the risk of non-performance by such parties is subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets, including the effects of the European sovereign debt crisis and/or a collapse of the Eurozone financial system. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely impact BlackRocks revenues and earnings.
The failure or negative performance of productsof other financial institutions could lead to reduced AUM in similar productsof BlackRock without regard to the performance of BlackRocks products.
The failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to a loss of confidence in similar productsof BlackRock without regard to the performance of BlackRocks products. Such a negative contagion could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products and have a material adverse impact on the Companys AUM, revenues and earnings.
Loss of employees could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues.
The ability to attract and retain quality personnel has contributed significantly to BlackRocks growth and success and is important to attracting and retaining clients. The market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, financial advisers and other professionals is competitive. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain required personnel. Loss of personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
BlackRocks investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors.
Separate account and commingled trust clients may terminate their investment management contracts with BlackRock or withdraw funds on short notice. The Company has, from time to time, lost separate accounts and could, in the future, lose accounts or significant AUM due to various circumstances such as adverse market conditions or poor performance.
Additionally, BlackRock manages its U.S. mutual funds, closed-end and exchanged-traded funds under management contracts with the funds that must be renewed and approved by the funds boards of directors annually. A majority of the directors of each such fund are independent from BlackRock. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the board of directors of each fund managed by the Company will approve the funds management contract each year, or will not condition its approval on the terms of the management contract being revised in a way that is adverse to the Company .
Further, the governing agreements of many of the Companys private investment funds generally provide that, subject to certain conditions, investors in those funds, and in some cases independent directors of those funds, may remove BlackRock as the investment adviser, general partner or the equivalent of the fund or liquidate the fund without cause by a simple majority vote, resulting in a reduction in the management or performance fees as well as the total carried interest BlackRock could earn.
Failure to comply with client contractual requirements and/or guidelines could result in damage awards against BlackRock and loss of revenues due to client terminations.
When clients retain BlackRock to manage assets or provide products or services on their behalf, they typically specify guidelines or contractual requirements that the Company is required to observe in the provision of its services. A failure to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in damage to BlackRocks reputation or in its clients seeking to recover losses, withdrawing their AUM or terminating their contracts, any of which could cause the Companys revenues and earnings to decline.
22 Table of Contents Competitive fee pressures could reduce revenues and profit margins.
The investment management industry, including the offering of exchange-traded funds, is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. To the extent that BlackRock is forced to compete on the basis of price, it may not be able to maintain its current fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or future new business could cause revenues and profit margins to decline.
Performance fees may increase revenue and earnings volatility.
A portion of the Companys revenues is derived from performance fees on investment and risk management advisory assignments. Performance fees represented $463 million, or 5%, of total revenue for the year ended December31, 2012. In most cases, performance fees are based on relative or absolute investment returns, although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards. Generally, the Company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, performance fees for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the Company may not earn performance fees in future periods. Performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns and the timing of revenue recognition, causing earnings to be more volatile.
Additional acquisitions may decrease earnings and harm the Companys competitive position.
BlackRock employs a variety of strategies intended to enhance earnings and expand product offerings in order to improve profit margins. These strategies have included hiring smaller-sized investment teams, acquisitions of investment management businesses, such as the MLIM, Quellos and BGI transactions and other small and medium-sized strategic acquisitions. These strategies may not be effective, and failure to successfully develop and implement these strategies may decrease earnings and harm the Companys competitive position in the investment management industry. In the event BlackRock pursues additional acquisitions, it may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at acceptable prices, and it may not be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from such acquisitions.
Risks Related to BlackRocks Operations Failure to maintain adequate infrastructure could impede BlackRocks productivity and growth.
The Companys infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers, and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. The failure to maintain an adequate infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of its business, including any expansion, could impede the Companys productivity and growth, which could cause the Companys earnings or stock price to decline. Additionally, the overall stability of the euro could pose operational risks to the Company or the funds and accounts that it manages as a result of the adverse impacts that such issues may have on the Companys trading, clearing, or counterparty relationships.
Failure to maintain adequate business continuity plans could have a material adverse impact on BlackRock and its products.
A significant portion of BlackRocks critical business operations is concentrated in a few geographic areas, including San Francisco, California, New York, New York and London, England. A major earthquake, hurricane, fire, terrorist or other catastrophic event could result in disruption to the business. The failure of the Company to maintain updated adequate business continuity plans, including secure backup facilities, systems and personnel could impede the Companys ability to operate upon a disruption, which could cause the Companys earnings or stock price to decline.
Operating in international markets increases BlackRocks operational, regulatory and other risks.
As a result of BlackRocks extensive international business activities, the Company faces increased operational, regulatory, reputational and foreign exchange rate risks. The failure of the Companys systems of internal control to properly mitigate such additional risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support such international activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions, which could cause the Companys earnings or stock price to decline.
Failure to maintain a technological advantage could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in revenues.
A key element to BlackRocks continued success is the ability to maintain a technological advantage in providing the sophisticated risk analytics incorporated into BlackRocks Aladdin technology platform that support investment advisory and BRS clients. Moreover, the Companys technological and software advantage is dependent on a number of third parties who provide various types of data and software. The failure of these third parties to provide such data or software could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact BlackRocks ability to provide services to its investment advisory and BRS clients. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain this technological advantage or be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in these systems and processes.
23 Table of Contents Failure to implement effective information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that could result in a decrease in BlackRocks earnings or stock price.
BlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of its information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them. An externally caused information security incident, such as a hacker attack, virus or worm, or an internally caused issue, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information and could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory actions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, could cause a decline in the Companys earnings or stock price.
The failure of a key vendor to BlackRock to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock and its products.
BlackRock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration, accounting, custody and transfer agent roles and other operational needs. The failure or inability of BlackRock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendors to fulfill their obligations could lead to operational issues for the Company and in certain products, which could result in financial losses for the Company and its clients.
Failure to manage risks in operating BlackRocks securities lending program for clients could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in revenues and liquidity.
The size of BlackRocks securities lending programs increased significantly with the completion of the BGI Transaction. As part of these programs, BlackRock must manage risks associated with (i)ensuring that the value of the collateral held against the securities on loan does not decline in value or become illiquid and that its nature and value complies with regulatory requirements and investment requirements; (ii)the potential that a borrower defaults or does not return a loaned security on a timely basis; and (iii)errors in the settlement of securities, daily mark-to-market valuations and collateral collection. The failure of the Companys controls to mitigate these risks could result in financial losses for the Companys clients that participate in its securities lending programs as well as for the Company.
Risks Related to Relationships with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC and Other Institutional Investors Merrill Lynch is an important distributor of BlackRocks products, and the Company is, therefore, subject to risks associated with the business of Merrill Lynch.
Under a global distribution agreement entered into with Merrill Lynch, Merrill Lynch provides distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock investment management products and services through its various distribution channels. The Company may not be successful in distributing products through Merrill Lynch or in distributing its products and services through other third-party distributors. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it experiences an increase in distribution-related costs, BlackRocks business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.
Loss of market share within Merrill Lynchs Global Wealth& Investment Management business could harm operating results.
A significant portion of BlackRocks revenue has historically come from AUM generated by Merrill Lynchs Global Wealth& Investment Management (GWIM) business. BlackRocks ability to maintain a strong relationship within GWIM is material to the Companys future performance. If one of the Companys competitors gains significant additional market share within the GWIM retail channel at the expense of BlackRock, then BlackRocks business, results of operations or financial condition may be negatively impacted.
PNC has agreed to vote as a stockholder in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRocks Board of Directors, and certain actions will require special board approval or the prior approval of PNC and Merrill Lynch.
As discussed in our proxy statement, PNC has agreed to vote all of its voting shares in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRocks Board of Directors in accordance with the provisions of its stockholder agreement with BlackRock. As a consequence, if the shares held by PNC constitute a substantial portion of the outstanding voting shares, matters submitted to a stockholder vote that require a majority or a plurality of votes for approval, including elections of directors, will have a substantial number of shares voted in accordance with the determinations of the BlackRock Board of Directors. This arrangement has the effect of concentrating a significant block of voting control over BlackRock in its Board of Directors, whether or not stockholders agree with any particular determination of the Board. At December31, 2012, PNC owned approximately 20.8% of BlackRocks voting common stock.
24 Table of Contents As discussed in our proxy statement, pursuant to our stockholder agreement with PNC, the following may not be done without prior approval of all of the independent directors, or at least two-thirds of the directors, then in office:  appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer of BlackRock;  any merger, issuance of shares or similar transaction in which beneficial ownership of a majority of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock would be held by persons different than those currently holding such majority of the total voting power, or any sale of all or substantially all assets of BlackRock;  any acquisition of any person or business which has a consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year that equals or exceeds 20% of BlackRocks consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year if such acquisition involves the current or potential issuance of BlackRock capital stock constituting more than 10% of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock issued and outstanding immediately after completion of such acquisition;  any acquisition of any person or business constituting a line of business that is materially different from the lines of business BlackRock and its controlled affiliates are engaged in at that time if such acquisition involves consideration in excess of 10% of the total assets of BlackRock on a consolidated basis;  except for repurchases otherwise permitted under their respective stockholder agreements, any repurchase by BlackRock or any subsidiary of shares of BlackRock capital stock such that after giving effect to such repurchase BlackRock and its subsidiaries shall have repurchased more than 10% of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock within the 12-month period ending on the date of such repurchase;  any amendment to BlackRocks certificate of incorporation or bylaws;  any matter requiring stockholder approval pursuant to the rules of the NYSE; or  any amendment, modification or waiver of any restriction or prohibition on Merrill Lynch or its affiliates provided for under its stockholder agreements.
Additionally, BlackRock may not enter into any of the following transactions without the prior approval of PNC:  any sale of any subsidiary of BlackRock, the annualized revenues of which, together with the annualized revenues of any other subsidiaries disposed of within the same year, are more than 20% of the annualized revenues of BlackRock for the preceding fiscal year on a consolidated basis;  for so long as BlackRock is a subsidiary of PNC for purposes of the BHC Act, entering into any business or activity that is prohibited for any such subsidiary under the BHC Act;  any amendment of any provision of a stockholder agreement between BlackRock and any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to PNC or materially more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock than to PNC;  any amendment, modification, repeal or waiver of BlackRocks certificate of incorporation or bylaws that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to the rights of PNC or more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock, or any settlement or consent in a regulatory enforcement matter that would be reasonably likely to cause PNC or any of its affiliates to suffer regulatory disqualification, suspension of registration or license or other material adverse regulatory consequences; or  a voluntary bankruptcy or similar filing by BlackRock.
As discussed in our proxy statement, under BlackRocks stockholder agreement with Merrill Lynch, which terminates on July31, 2013, BlackRock may not enter into any of the following transactions without the prior approval of Merrill Lynch:  any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of a stockholder agreement between BlackRock and PNC or any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to Merrill Lynch or materially more favorable to the rights of PNC or other stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock than to Merrill Lynch;  any amendment, modification, repeal or waiver of BlackRocks certificate of incorporation or bylaws that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to the rights of Merrill Lynch or more favorable to the rights of PNC or other stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock, or any settlement or consent in a regulatory enforcement matter that would be 25 Table of Contents reasonably likely to cause Merrill Lynch or any of its affiliates to suffer regulatory disqualification, suspension of registration or license or other material adverse regulatory consequences;  any acquisition which would be reasonably likely to require Merrill Lynch to register with the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company or become subject to regulation under the BHC Act, the Change of Bank Control Act of 1978 or Section10 of the Homeowners Loan Act of 1934; or  a voluntary bankruptcy or similar filing by BlackRock.
Currently, Merrill Lynch and its affiliates own a de minimis number of shares of our capital stock.
PNC and several other institutional stockholders own a large portion of BlackRocks capital stock. Future sales of our common stock in the public market by the Company or its large stockholders could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
As of December31, 2012, PNC owned 21.9% of the Companys capital stock and several other institutional holders own in excess of 5% of BlackRock shares. The Company has entered into a registration rights agreement with PNC. The registration rights agreement, which includes customary piggyback registration provisions, may continue to allow PNC to cause us to file one or more registration statements for the resale of its shares of capital stock and cooperate in certain underwritten offerings. Sales by us or our large stockholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market pursuant to registration rights or otherwise, or the perception that these sales might occur, couldcause the market price of our common stock to decline.
Legal and Regulatory Risks BlackRock is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and internationally.
BlackRocks business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and around the world. See the discussion under Item 1  Business  Regulation. Violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, temporary or permanent prohibition of the engagement in certain activities, reputational harm and related client terminations, suspensions of personnel or revocation of their licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser or broker-dealer registrations, or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on BlackRocks reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition and cause the Companys earnings or stock price to decline.
BlackRock may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory changes in the United States and internationally.
As previously mentioned, in July2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the DFA) was signed into law. The DFA is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions in order to be implemented. The adoption of these regulations and decisions will in large measure determine the impact of the DFA on BlackRock. BlackRock is continuing to review the impact of the legislation and related rule-making will have on its business, financial condition and results of operations.
The business impact of the DFA and its regulations, and other new laws or regulations, including those affecting money market funds, or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations in the United States or internationally, could adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRocks business activities, could require BlackRock to change certain business practices and could expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and tax costs).
The DFA charges the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve) with establishing enhanced regulatory requirements for non-bank financial institutions designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). Among the potential impacts of the DFA, if BlackRock were designated a systemically important financial institution (a SIFI), it could be subject to these enhanced prudential, supervisory and other requirements, which, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely impact BlackRocks business and operations.
Provisions of the DFA referred to as the Volcker Rule place limitations on the ability of banks, and their subsidiaries and affiliates, to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain investment funds, including hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of those funds (collectively covered funds). It is expected that the Volcker Rule will apply to BlackRock by virtue of BlackRocks relationship to PNC, and BlackRock could become subject to similar limitations if it is designated a SIFI. The Volcker Rule became effective on July21, 2012; however, final implementing regulations have not yet been issued. Entities subject to the Volcker Rule will have until at least July21, 2014 to come into compliance with the provisions of the Volcker Rule. To the extent the Volcker Rule applies to BlackRock, it would limit BlackRocks ability to make and retain investments in covered funds, require BlackRock to remove its name from the name of its covered funds, and limit investments in covered funds by 26 Table of Contents BlackRock employees, among other restrictions. Depending on the final implementation of the Volcker Rule and the granting of extensions, BlackRock could be required to sell certain seed and co-investments that it holds, including at a discount, depending on market conditions. The scope of the definition of covered funds is not yet known, and therefore these restrictions could apply to funds other than those commonly referred to as hedge funds and private equity funds. These limitations and restrictions could disadvantage BlackRock against those competitors that are not subject to the Volcker Rule in the ability to attract clients into BlackRock covered funds and to retain employees.
Regulatory authorities, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), the FSOC and the International Organization of Securities Commissions, continue to focus on the need for additional regulations for money market mutual funds. In November 2012, the FSOC issued proposed recommendations for money market mutual fund reform for public comment, which closed on February15, 2013. The FSOC recommendations included floating the net asset value of funds, requiring net asset value buffers and requiring that a portion of redemptions be held back by stable net asset value funds for a period of time, the retention of capital and liquidity gates and/or redemption fees. If adopted by the SEC, these proposals could significantly affect money market fund products and the entire money market fund industry. In light of the uncertainty regarding what changes may ultimately be adopted in a final SEC rule, we cannot predict what investor appetite will be for money market mutual fund products following the adoption of any such reforms or the impact of such reforms on BlackRock.
In 2012, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States (the OCC) amended the regulations governing bank-maintained short-term investment funds (STIFs) to include new disclosure requirements regarding portfolio holdings and to more closely align portfolio limitations, such as maximum weighted average maturity and weighted average life, with those applicable to SEC registered money market funds. As a result of the new OCC rules, BlackRock chose to sell certain securities held within certain STIFs during the fourth quarter of 2012 and to make a one-time contribution to the STIFs to maintain the value of the funds while ensuring compliance with the OCC rules. As a result of the security sales, these STIFs are currently in compliance with the new OCC rules. The ultimate result of these rule changes is uncertain.
Further, regulations under the DFA relating to regulation of swaps and derivatives could impact the manner by which BlackRock-advised funds and accounts use and trade swaps and other derivatives, and could significantly increase the costs of derivatives trading conducted by BlackRock on behalf of its clients.BlackRock will also need to build new compliance mechanisms to monitor compliance with SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) rules concerning, among other things, the registration and regulation of commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors (and the accompanying registration and regulation of such entities by the National Futures Association), the registration status of dealer counterparties and other counterparties who are major swap participants in the swap markets, and requirements concerning mandatory clearing of certain swap transactions. BlackRock, on behalf of its clients, is also preparing for mandated central clearing of swaps and mandated trading venue requirements.
In addition, BlackRock has begun reporting certain information about a number of its private funds to the SEC and certain information about a number of its commodity pools to the CFTC, pursuant to systemic risk reporting requirements adopted by both agencies, which have required, and will continue to require, investments in people and systems to assure timely and accurate reporting.
The SEC, the Internal Revenue Service and the CFTC each continue to review the use of futures and derivatives by mutual funds, which could result in regulations that further limit the use of futures and derivatives by mutual funds. If adopted, these limitations could require BlackRock to change certain mutual fund business practices or to register additional entities with the CFTC, which could result in additional costs and/or restrictions.
In addition, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, the European Commission set out a detailed plan for EU financial reform, outlining a number of initiatives to be reflected in new or updated directives, regulations and recommendations of which the review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) was a part. These, together with the changes contemplated by the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), will have direct and indirect effects on BlackRocks operations in the European Economic Area, including increased compliance, disclosure and other obligations, which could impact BlackRocks ability to expand in these markets.
The foregoing regulatory changes, and other reforms globally, could also lead to business disruptions, could adversely impact the value of assets in which BlackRock has invested on behalf of clients and/or via seed or co-investments, and, to the extent the regulations strictly control the activities of financial services firms, could make it more difficult for BlackRock to conduct certain business activities or distinguish itself from competitors. See Item 1  Business  Regulation above for additional information regarding certain laws and regulations that affect BlackRocks business.
27 Table of Contents Failure to comply with the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act) and the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act) and related regulations could result in substantial harm to BlackRocks reputation and results of operations.
Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act and BlackRocks U.S. mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations and fiduciary duties on registered investment advisers, including record-keeping, operating and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act imposes similar obligations, as well as additional detailed operational and compliance requirements, on investment advisers to registered investment companies. The failure of any of the relevant subsidiaries to comply with the Advisers Act or the Investment Company Act could cause the SEC to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of either of these acts, including censure, termination of an investment advisers registration or prohibition to serve as adviser to SEC-registered funds, and could lead to litigation by investors in those funds or harm to the Companys reputation, any of which could cause its earnings or stock price to decline.
Failure to comply with ERISA regulations could result in penalties and cause the Companys earnings or stock price to decline.
Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and to regulations promulgated thereunder, insofar as they act as a fiduciary under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit specified transactions involving ERISA plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions. The failure of any of the relevant subsidiaries to comply with these requirements could result in significant penalties that could reduce the Companys earnings or cause its stock price to decline.
BlackRock is subject to banking regulations that may limit its business activities.
Because the total equity ownership interest of PNC in BlackRock exceeds certain thresholds, BlackRock is deemed to be a non-bank subsidiary of PNC, which is regulated as a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. As a non-bank subsidiary of PNC, BlackRock is subject to banking regulation, including the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve.
Such banking regulation limits the activities and the types of businesses that BlackRock may conduct. The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over BlackRock, including the power to prohibit BlackRock from conducting any activity that, in the Federal Reserves opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice, and to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations. Any failure of PNC to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain BlackRock activities and its growth. In addition, BlackRocks trust bank subsidiary is subject to regulation by the OCC, and is subject to capital requirements established by the OCC. The OCC has broad enforcement authority over BlackRocks trust bank subsidiary. Also, provisions of the DFA referred to as the Volcker Rule could, to the extent the final Volcker Rule is determined to apply to BlackRocks activities, affect the method by which BlackRock invests in and operates its investment funds, including private equity funds, hedge funds and fund of funds platforms. Being subject to banking regulation, including potentially the Volcker Rule, may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because most of its competitors are not subject to these limitations.
Failure to comply with laws and regulations in the United Kingdom, other member states of the European Union, Hong Kong, Japan, Australia and other non-U.S. jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates could result in substantial harm to BlackRocks reputation and results of operations.
The FSA regulates BlackRocks subsidiaries in the United Kingdom. Authorization by the FSA is required to conduct any financial services-related business in the United Kingdom under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FSAs rules made under that Act govern a firms capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients and systems and controls. Breaches of these rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against the Companys U.K.-regulated subsidiaries.
In addition, these subsidiaries, and other European subsidiaries, branches or representative offices, must comply with the pan-European regime established by MiFID, which regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the EEA, as well as the Capital Requirements Directive, which delineates regulatory capital requirements. As discussed under Item1 - Business - Regulation, in the aftermath of the financial crisis the European Commission set out a detailed plan to complete the EUs financial reform, outlining a number of initiatives to be reflected in new or updated directives, regulations and recommendations. The AIFMD, which became effective on July21, 2011, is required to be 28 Table of Contents implemented by EU member states by July22, 2013. Compliance with the AIFMDs requirements may restrict alternative investment funds marketing and place additional compliance and disclosure obligations regarding remuneration, capital requirements, leverage, valuation, stakes in EU companies, depositaries, the domicile of custodians and liquidity management. UCITS IV was required to be adopted in the national law of each EU member state by July1, 2011. UCITS IV was adopted into national law by the United Kingdom prior to the deadline but several other EU member states are still in various stages of the adoption process. There are also European Commission consultations in process that are intended to improve retail investor protection including UCITS V, which addresses, among other items, custodial liability. Recent proposals on packaged retail investment products (PRIPs) are to be implemented through the strengthening of MiFID standards (for non-insurance PRIPs), revisions to the Insurance Mediation Directives selling standard (for all insurance-based PRIPs) and new investor disclosure requirements for all PRIPs through a separate EU legislative process. In the United Kingdom, the Bribery Act 2010 came into force in July 2011 and has required the implementation of additional procedures on the Companys U.K.-regulated subsidiaries. In addition, a retail distribution review initiated by the FSA is expected to change how investment advice is paid for in the United Kingdom for all investment products. Final retail distribution rules were published in 2011, with implementation at the end of 2012. In a similar area, a further European Commission Regulation, the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), was adopted in August 2012, and requires the central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives and the mandatory reporting of all derivative contracts. Some of the EMIR technical standards have recently been finalized and the remainder are expected to be finalized in 2013.
In Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (the FIEL) and the Law Concerning Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the JFSA), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEL.
In Australia, BlackRocks subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. ASIC regulates companies and financial services in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection. Failure to comply with applicable law and regulations could result in the cancellation, suspension or variation of the relevant subsidiaries licenses in Australia.
The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (the SFO), which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of intermediaries. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (the SFC). The SFC is also empowered under the SFO to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. The relevant BlackRock subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC from time to time. Failure to comply with the applicable laws, regulations, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC could result in the suspension or revocations of the licenses granted by the SFC.
There are similar legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many other non-U.S. jurisdictions where BlackRocks subsidiaries conduct business or where the funds and products it manages are organized. Failure to comply with laws and regulations in any of these jurisdictions could result in substantial harm to BlackRocks reputation and results of operation.
Legal proceedings could adversely affect operating results, financial condition and cash flows for a particular period.
Many aspects of BlackRocks business involve substantial risks of legal liability. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRocks activities. From time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific or other investigations or proceedings. Additionally, certain of the investment funds that the Company manages are subject to lawsuits, any of which could potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the Company being liable to the funds for any resulting damages.
Item1B.
UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS The Company has no unresolved comments from the SEC staff relating to BlackRocks periodic or current reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act.

BlackRock leases additional office space in New York City at 40 East 52nd Street and throughout the world, including Boston, Chicago, Edinburgh, Gurgaon (India), HongKong, London, Melbourne, Munich, Princeton (New Jersey), San Francisco, Seattle, Singapore, Sydney, Taipei and Tokyo. The Company also owns an 84,500 square foot office building in Wilmington (Delaware).
Item3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various U.S. federal, state governmental and domestic and international regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide or other investigations or proceedings. It is BlackRocks policy to cooperate fully with such inquiries. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRocks activities. Additionally, certain of the investment funds that the Company manages are subject to lawsuits, any of which potentially could harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the Company being liable to the funds for any resulting damages.
Management, after consultation with legal counsel, currently does not anticipate that the aggregate liability, if any, arising out of regulatory matters or lawsuits will have a material effect on BlackRocks results of operations, financial position or cash flows. However, there is no assurance as to whether any such pending or threatened matters will have a material effect on BlackRocks results of operations, financial position or cash flows in any future reporting period. Due to uncertaintiessurrounding the outcome of these matters, management cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of lossthat may arise from these matters.

Operating income of $3,392 million and operating margin of 39.7% increased $225 million and 40 bps, respectively, from 2010 reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by net increases in operating expenses as discussed above. Operating income on an as adjusted basis excluded non-GAAP expense adjustments totaling $143 million in 2011 and $169 million in 2010. Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests) decreased $138 million. Income tax expense on an as adjusted basis excluded the $198 million and $30 million non-cash benefits in 2011 and 2010, respectively, described above. Earnings per diluted common share rose $0.91 from 2010.

Business Outlook BlackRock offers clients a broad range of equity, fixed income, multi-asset and alternative investment products designed to track various indices (beta), achieve returns in excess of specified benchmarks (alpha) or deliver absolute returns. The diversity of BlackRocks investment platform, across asset classes, investment styles and geographies  combined with world-class risk management, analytics and advisory expertise positions the Company well to meet the needs of clients in 2013 and beyond and to continue to attract asset flows as investor needs and sentiment evolve.
BlackRock ended 2012 with record assets under management (AUM) of $3.792 trillion as clients sought efficient tools and innovative solutions to meet their investment objectives over both the short and long term. The Company experienced strong client demand for exchange traded funds and products (ETFs and ETPs, respectively), alternative and emerging market investment products, high-yielding income strategies, outcome-oriented solutions and retirement-related products, and the Company expects this demand to continue into 2013.
37 Table of Contents In early 2013, BlackRock continues to see signs of an improving global economy. While this offers the potential for greater financial market stability, political and regulatory dynamics, persistent low interest rates and protracted periods of heightened volatility will continue to pose challenges in the investment landscape. BlackRock will continue to monitor these factors actively in 2013, along with global credit and monetary policies (including quantitative easing and the direction of interest rates) and their effects on corporate earnings growth.
While investing for stable income remains a core objective for many of its clients, BlackRock expects clients  particularly in its institutional business  to trend towards barbelling their risk profile through the combination of active and index strategies and the use of alternative and multi-asset investment solutions, complemented with access to BlackRocks risk management tools and advisory services.
AUM and Flows  BlackRocks unique combination of index and active capabilities positions the Company well to help underfunded corporate and public pension plans narrow the gap between their assets and liabilities with barbell strategies that use a combination of index, alpha, multi-asset and alternative products. As responsibility for retirement funding continues to move away from defined benefit plans into defined contributions plans and ultimately to individuals, BlackRock is also well positioned to offer individual investment options through its LifePath  target date portfolios and a wide array of ETFs and other mutual fund products.
BlackRock has a leading global market share in ETPs through iShares, which leads the industry in AUM and the number of products offered in various markets. The industrys global growth reflects both continued adoption of ETFs by institutional and retail investors and the introduction of new products. ETP asset growth has historically been linked to positive markets, with investors looking to capitalize on strong market returns. In the continued environment of ultra-low interest rates, industry flows shifted in 2012 toward fixed income products and, within equities, to developed markets. BlackRock believes there is opportunity in emerging markets and is well positioned to grow its active franchise in these markets, including China. While more asset managers may enter the marketplace and offer similar products at lower fees, BlackRock believes that many factors beyond price influence investor preferences. These preferences are driven to varying degrees by performance (as measured by tracking error, or the difference between net returns on the ETP and the corresponding targeted index), liquidity (the bid-ask spread), tax-efficiency, transparency and client service.
BlackRock believes alternative investments will continue to become more important for both institutional and retail clients seeking higher returns through alpha-generating products. Several of BlackRocks single strategy hedge funds are top performers in the industry and are well positioned to grow in 2013.
Cash management assets may decline from year-end levels if clients begin to re-risk their portfolios in the search for yield or equity return opportunities amid continued low interest rates, including in the United States where the Federal Reserve expects rates to remain low until 2014. BlackRocks diversified global product offerings, record of client service and independent advisory capabilities may enable it to retain a portion of these assets.
Regulatory Reform  BlackRock will continue to monitor the evolving regulatory landscape and to assess its influence on the competitive environment, including on liquidity and trading costs, which may present risks as well as opportunities for BlackRock and its clients.
Performance fees and BRS/advisory fees  BlackRock improved investment performance in key areas such as fixed income and scientific active equity in 2012 and strong investment performance will again be a priority in 2013. Higher market levels and investment performance may continue to enable the Companys alternative investment products to contribute additional performance fee revenue.
BlackRock expects continuing strong global demand for its Aladdin operating platform and its comprehensive risk reporting capabilities from sophisticated institutional investors and governmental agencies investing in longer-term risk management solutions. The Company also expects to see continuing strong demand for its BlackRock Solutions financial markets advisory services.
Future opportunities  BlackRock intends to continue to invest in its people, its platform and its global brand. The Company will continue to build out its product offering and geographic presence, including in emerging markets, and to grow its iShares franchise, both through organic growth and targeted acquisitions.
38 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows: (a) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income, as adjusted, equals operating income, GAAP basis, excluding certain items management deems non-recurring, or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value, as indicated in the table below. Operating income used for operating margin measurement equals operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income used for operating margin measurement, divided by revenue (net of distribution and servicing costs and amortization of deferred sales commissions) used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below.
(Dollar amounts in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 3,524 $ 3,249 $ 2,998 Non-GAAP expense adjustments: BGI transaction/integration costs Employee compensation and benefits   25 General and administration   65 Total BGI transaction/integration costs   90 U.K. lease exit costs (8 ) 63  Contribution to STIFs 30   Restructuring charges  32  PNC LTIP funding obligation 22 44 58 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution  7 10 Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans 6 (3 ) 11 Operating income, as adjusted 3,574 3,392 3,167 Closed-end fund launch costs 22 26 15 Closed-end fund launch commissions 3 3 2 Operating income used for operating margin measurement $ 3,599 $ 3,421 $ 3,184 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 9,337 $ 9,081 $ 8,612 Non-GAAP adjustments: Distribution and servicing costs (364 ) (386 ) (408 ) Amortization of deferred sales commissions (55 ) (81 ) (102 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement $ 8,918 $ 8,614 $ 8,102 Operating margin, GAAP basis 37.7 % 35.8 % 34.8 % Operating margin, as adjusted 40.4 % 39.7 % 39.3 % Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRocks financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors.
Operating income, as adjusted: Operating income, as adjusted reflects non-GAAP expense adjustments. BGI transaction and integration costs consisted principally of compensation expense, legal fees, marketing and promotional, occupancy and consulting expenses incurred in conjunction with the BGI acquisition from Barclays. U.K. lease exit costs represent costs to exit two locations in London in the third quarter 2011. The amount in 2012 represents an adjustment related to the estimated costs initially recorded in third quarter 2011. The contribution to STIFs represents a one-time contribution to certain of the Companys bank-managed STIFs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information). Restructuring charges consist of compensation costs and professional fees.
39 Table of Contents The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (LTIP) funded or to be funded through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC and a Merrill Lynch& Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch) cash compensation contribution, has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact BlackRocks book value. The expense related to the Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution ceased at the end of third quarter 2011. As of first quarter 2012, all of the Merrill Lynch contributions had been received.
Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non-operating income (expense).
Management believes operating income exclusive of these items is a useful measure in evaluating BlackRocks operating performance and helps enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented.
Operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Companys results until future periods.
Operating margin, as adjusted, allows the Company to compare performance from period-to-period by adjusting for items that may not recur, recur infrequently or may have an economic offset in non-operating income (expense). Examples of such adjustments include BGI transaction and integration costs, U.K. lease exit costs, contribution to STIFs, restructuring charges, closed-end fund launch costs, commissions paid to certain employees as compensation and fluctuations in compensation expense based on mark-to-market movements in investments held to fund certain compensation plans. The Company also uses operating margin, as adjusted, to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies. Management uses both the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the financial performance of BlackRock. The non-GAAP measure by itself may pose limitations because it does not include all of the Companys revenues and expenses.
Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties. Management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted for under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, substantially offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. For each of these items, BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues.
(b) Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted: Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, is presented below. The compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis.
(Dollar amounts in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis $ (54 ) $ (114 ) $ 23 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to NCI (18 ) 2 (13 ) Non-operating income (expense) (1) (36 ) (116 ) 36 Compensation expense related to (appreciation) depreciation on deferred compensation plans (6 ) 3 (11 ) Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted $ (42 ) $ (113 ) $ 25 (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI.
Management believes non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides comparability of this information among reporting periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRocks non-operating contribution to its results. As compensation expense associated with (appreciation) depreciation on investments related to certain deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, substantially offsets the gain (loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management 40 Table of Contents believes non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks non-operating results that impact book value.
(c) Net income attributable to BlackRock, as adjusted: Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRocks profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, GAAP basis, adjusted for significant non-recurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data) 2012 2011 2010 Net income attributable to BlackRock, GAAP basis $ 2,458 $ 2,337 $ 2,063 Non-GAAP adjustments, net of tax: (d) BGI transaction/integration costs   59 U.K. lease exit costs (5 ) 43  Contribution to STIFs 21   Restructuring charges  22  PNC LTIP funding obligation 14 30 40 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution  5 7 Income tax law changes/election (50 ) (198 ) (30 ) Net income attributable to BlackRock, as adjusted $ 2,438 $ 2,239 $ 2,139 Allocation of net income, as adjusted, to common shares (e) $ 2,435 $ 2,218 $ 2,109 Diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding (f) 178,017,679 187,116,410 192,692,047 Diluted earnings per common share, GAAP basis (f) $ 13.79 $ 12.37 $ 10.55 Diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted (f) $ 13.68 $ 11.85 $ 10.94 See note (a)Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on BGI transaction/integration costs, U.K. lease exit costs, contribution to STIFs, restructuring charges, PNC LTIP funding obligation and Merrill Lynch compensation contribution.
During 2012, income tax changes included adjustments related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the Companys organizational structure. During 2011 and 2010, income tax changes included adjustments related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to a state tax election and enacted U.K., Japan, U.S. state and local tax legislation. The resulting decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, as these items do not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
(d) In 2012, 2011 and 2010 non-GAAP adjustments were tax effected at 31.4%, 31.8% and 33%, respectively, reflecting a blended rate applicable to the adjustments.
(e) Amounts exclude net income attributable to participating securities (see below).
(f) Non-voting participating preferred shares are considered to be common stock equivalents for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. Certain unvested RSUs are not included in diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding as they are deemed participating securities in accordance with required provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 260-10, Earnings per Share . In 2012, 2011 and 2010, average outstanding participating securities were 0.2million, 1.8million and 2.8million, respectively.

(4) Amounts include outflows due to manager concentration considerations prior to third quarter 2011 and outflows from scientific active equity performance prior to second quarter 2011. As a result of client investment manager concentration limits and the scientific active equity performance, outflows were expected to occur for a period of time subsequent to the close of the transaction.
(5) Amounts include AUM acquired from Swiss Re Private Equity Partners (the SRPEP Transaction) in September 2012 of $6.2 billion, the Claymore Investments, Inc. acquisition (the Claymore Transaction) in March 2012 of $7.6 billion and BGI acquisition adjustments in 2010 of $6.2 billion.
(6) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes.
BlackRock has historically grown aggregate AUM through organic growth and acquisitions. Management believes that the Company will be able to continue to grow AUM by focusing on strong investment performance, the efficient delivery of beta for index products, client service, by developing new products and new distribution capabilities and by continuing appropriate acquisitions.

(5) Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments.
AUM increased $278.9 billion, or 8%, to $3.792 trillion at December31, 2012 from $3.513 trillion at December31, 2011. The increase in AUM was driven largely by market gains and positive net new business, excluding the effect of two single client low-fee, institutional index fixed income outflows of $36.0 billion and $74.2 billion in first quarter 2012 and third quarter 2012, respectively. Total flows included $74.5 billion of planned advisory distributions and acquired AUM related to the SRPEP and the Claymore Transactions of $13.7 billion.
Net market appreciation of $321.4 billion reflectedgrowth in U.S. and global equity markets and $67.8 billion appreciation in fixed income products across the majority of strategies.
The $15.7 billion net increase in AUM from converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling and the euro, partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.

The decline in AUM was primarily attributable to $34.6 billion in net market and foreign exchange valuation declines, $29.9 billion of advisory distributions and $22.9 billion of cash management net outflows, partially offset by $67.3 billion of long-term net new business, before giving effect to the final BGI merger-related outflows of $28.3 billion recorded in the first half of 2011.
Net market depreciation of $27.5 billion included $128.1 billion of depreciation in equity products resulting from the decline in global equity, partially offset by appreciation in fixed income products of $100.7 billion.
The $7.1 billion net decrease in AUM from converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, pound sterling and Canadian dollar, partially offset by weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.
Discussion of Financial Results Introduction BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes.
BlackRock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. The revenue earned is shared between BlackRock and the funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. Historically, securities lending revenue in the second quarter exceeds the other quarters during the year.
Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees, based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. Historically, the magnitude of performance fees in the third and fourth quarters generally exceeds the first two calendar quarters in a year due to the greater number of products with performance measurement periods that end on either September30 or December31.
BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services related to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Approximately $14 trillion of positions are processed on the Companys Aladdin  operating platform, which serves as the investment/risk solutions system for BlackRock and other institutional investors. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i)percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform, (ii)fixed fees and (iii)performance fees if contractual thresholds are met.
BlackRock builds upon its leadership position to meet the growing need for investment and risk management solutions.Through its scale and diversity of products, it is able to provide its clients with customized solutions including fiduciary outsourcing for liability-driven investments and overlay strategies for pension plan sponsors, balance sheet management and related services for insurance companies andtarget date and target return funds, as well as asset allocation portfolios, for retail investors.BlackRock is also able to service these clients via its Aladdin platform to provide risk management and other outsourcing services for institutional investors and custom and tailored solutions to address complex risk exposures.

Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes, including Federal Reserve Bank stock. BlackRock does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients.
In addition, non-operating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds and consolidated collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). The portion of non-operating income (expense) not attributable to BlackRock is allocated to NCI on the consolidated statements of income.

GAAP.
General and administration expenses decreased $56 million, or 4%, to $1,359 million in 2012 from $1,415 million in 2011. Lower occupancy and office-related expenses, primarily due to $63 million of U.K. lease exit costs incurred in the third quarter 2011, and lower professional services costs contributed to the overall net decrease in general and administration expenses.

In 2011, general and administration expenses included $63 million of U.K. lease exit costs related to the Companys exit from two London locations. The adjustment for U.K. lease exit costs in 2012 represents an adjustment to the estimated costs initially recorded in 2011. These amounts were excluded from as adjusted general and administrative expenses.
As Adjusted.

These increases were partially offset by a $47 million decrease in incentive compensation.
Distribution and Servicing Costs.
Distribution and servicing costs decreased $22 million, or 5%, to $386 million in 2011 from $408 million in 2010. The $22 million decrease related to lower cash management-related costs of $45 million, reflecting lower average AUM and higher yield-support waivers resulting in lower levels of distribution costs, partially offset by higher costs due to increases in average AUM for open-end and closed-end funds, separate accounts and variable annuities.
Distribution and servicing costs in 2011 included $207 million of costs attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and affiliates, and $3 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates compared with $246 million and $10 million, respectively, in 2010. Distribution and servicing costs related to other third parties, including Barclays, increased $24 million to $176 million in 2011 from $152 million in 2010 due to an expansion of distribution platforms and higher long-term AUM.

Higher occupancy and office-related expenses (including $63 million of U.K. lease exit costs), higher professional services costs and other general and administration expenses contributed to the overall net increase in general and administration expenses. The $23 million increase in other general and administration expenses reflected higher VAT expense and recruiting costs in 2011 offset by the non-recurrence of other general and administration provisions recorded in 2010 related to an outstanding loan to Anthracite Capital Inc. The increase in general and administration expenses was partially offset by a decrease in charitable contributions as well as a decrease in regulatory, filing and licenses fees, primarily due to a $20 million 2010 U.K. industry regulatory assessment.
Non-GAAP Adjustments.
In 2011 general and administration expenses included the previously mentioned $63 million of U.K. lease exit costs. In 2010, general and administration expenses included $65 million of BGI integration costs primarily consisting of $33 million of marketing and promotional costs, $12 million of professional services and $12 million of occupancy costs.

The as adjusted effective tax rate of 33.0% for 2010 excluded the $30 million non-cash tax benefit mentioned above.
Balance Sheet Overview As Adjusted Balance Sheet The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition excluding the impact of separate account assets and collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending securities held by separate account assets) and separate account liabilities and collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements, consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) and consolidated sponsored investment funds.
The Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to eliminate gross presentation of certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or non-controlling interests and ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders equity (excluding appropriated retained earnings related to consolidated collateralized loan obligations) or cash flows. Management reviews the Companys as adjusted balance sheet, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an economic presentation of its total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements The separate account assets are maintained by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. In accordance with GAAP, the Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Companys assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the Companys consolidated statements of income. While 53 Table of Contents BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of the clients.
In addition, the Company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the collateral received under securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral.
Consolidated VIEs At December31, 2012, BlackRocks consolidated VIEs included CLOs and one investment fund. The assets of these VIEs are not available to creditors of the Company and the Company has no obligation to settle the liabilities of the VIEs. While BlackRock has no material economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee, as well as a potential performance fee, for the service of managing these assets on behalf of clients.

The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRocks stockholders equity.
Cash and Cash Equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents at December31, 2012 and December31, 2011 included $133 million and $196 million of cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, respectively. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2012.
Accounts Receivable.
Accounts receivable at December31, 2012 increased $290 million from December31, 2011, primarily reflecting higher receivables resulting from an increase in base fees related to AUM growth and higher performance fees, and an increase in unit trust receivables, substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
Investments.
BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investments that are held by sponsored investment funds deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. As a result, management reviews BlackRocks investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company presents total investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of its investments that are owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net non-operating gain (loss) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.
55 Table of Contents The Company further presents total net economic investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another gauge for investors as the economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is substantially offset by a change in compensation expense and the impact of hedged investments is substantially mitigated by total return swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRocks stockholders equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Companys regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Companys net economic investment exposure.

(2) The decrease of $239 million related to a lower holding requirement of Federal Reserve Bank stock held by BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (BTC).
Total investments, as adjusted, at December31, 2012 increased $137 million from December31, 2011, resulting from $765million of purchases/capital contributions, $185million from positive market valuations and earnings from equity method investments, and $64 million from net additional carried interest capital allocations, partially offset by $742million of sales/maturities and $135 million of distributions representing return of capital and return on investments.
56 Table of Contents The following table represents the carrying value of investments, by asset type, at December31, 2012 and December31, 2011: (Dollar amounts in millions) December31, 2012 December31, 2011 Variance Amount %Change Private equity $ 298 $ 306 $ (8 ) (3 %) Real estate 122 108 14 13 % Distressed credit/mortgage funds 214 217 (3 ) (1 %) Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 159 167 (8 ) (5 %) Other investments (1) 418 264 154 58 % Total economic investment exposure $ 1,211 $ 1,062 $ 149 14 % (1) Other investments primarily include seed investments in fixed income, commodities and equity funds/strategies as well as U.K. government securities held for regulatory purposes. The increase in other investments reflected higher seed investments in fourth quarter 2012.

In accordance with GAAP, certain equity method investees do not account for both their financial assets and financial liabilities under fair value measures, therefore, the Companys investment in such equity method investees may not represent fair value.
(2) Amounts include BlackRocks portion of cash and cash equivalents, other assets and liabilities that are consolidated from non-VIE sponsored investment funds. See Note 5, Fair Value Disclosures, to the Companys consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item8 of this filing, for total GAAP investments.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
Goodwill and intangible assets at December31, 2012 increased $164 million from December31, 2011, primarily due to the SRPEP and Claymore Transactions, partially offset by $157 million of amortization expense.
Other Assets.
Other assets at December31, 2012 increased $14 million from December31, 2011, primarily related to higher earnings from certain operating advisory company investments and an increase in property and equipment, partially offset by a decline in receivables from related parties and lower current income taxes receivable.
Accrued Compensation and Benefits.
Accrued compensation and benefits at December31, 2012 increased $164 million from December31, 2011, primarily related to higher 2012 incentive compensation accruals.
Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities.
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December31, 2012 increased $132 million from December31, 2011, due to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within accounts receivable), increased accruals, including direct fund expenses and marketing and higher current income taxes payable.
Borrowings.
Borrowings at December31, 2012 increased $997 million from December31, 2011 primarily resulting from $1.5 billion of net proceeds from new issuances of long-term borrowings, partially offset by repayments of $500 million.
Deferred Income Tax Liabilities.
Net deferred income tax liabilities at December31, 2012 decreased $30 million, primarily as a result of the effects of temporary differences associated with deferred stock compensation and investment income offset by the Claymore Transaction. In addition, the decrease related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the Companys organizational structure.
Other Liabilities.
Other liabilities at December31, 2012 increased $115 million from December31, 2011, primarily resulting from an increase in deferred carried interest, liabilities of consolidated funds and other operating liabilities.
57 Table of Contents Stockholders Equity.
Total stockholders equity at December31, 2012 increased $355 million from December31, 2011, resulting from $2.5 billion of net income attributable to BlackRock, $451 million of stock-based compensation expense, $64 million excess tax benefits from vested stock-based compensation, $53 million of foreign currency translation adjustments and $56 million of issuances of common shares related to employee stock transactions. The increase in stockholders equity was partially offset by $1.7 billion of share repurchases and $1.1 billion of cash dividend payments.
Liquidity and Capital Resources BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds and VIEs In accordance with GAAP, BlackRock consolidates certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds and CLOs, notwithstanding the fact BlackRock may only have a minority interest, if any, in these funds or CLOs. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.
The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds and consolidated VIEs: (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAP Basis Impact on CashFlows ofConsolidated Sponsored Investment Funds Impact on Cash Flows of Consolidated VIEs CashFlows Excluding Impactof Consolidated Sponsored Investment Fundsand VIEs Cash and cash equivalents, December31, 2010 $ 3,367 $ 65 $  $ 3,302 Cash flows from operating activities 2,826 42 136 2,648 Cash flows from investing activities (204 ) 24  (228 ) Cash flows from financing activities (2,485 ) 65 (136 ) (2,414 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 2   2 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 139 131  8 Cash and cash equivalents, December31, 2011 $ 3,506 $ 196 $  $ 3,310 Cash flows from operating activities 2,240 (256 ) (227 ) 2,723 Cash flows from investing activities (266 ) (211 )  (55 ) Cash flows from financing activities (944 ) 404 227 (1,575 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 70   70 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 1,100 (63 )  1,163 Cash and cash equivalents, December31, 2012 $ 4,606 $ 133 $  $ 4,473 Sources of BlackRocks operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, revenue from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, other revenue and distribution fees.
BlackRock uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, direct fund expenses, general and administration expenses, interest and principal on the Companys borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRocks capital stock, repurchases of the Companys stock, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.
58 Table of Contents Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including the effect of cash payments related to year-end incentive compensation.
Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, for the year ended December31, 2012 were $55 million and primarily included $435 million of purchases of investments, $267 million related to the Claymore and SRPEP Transactions and $150 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $724 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and $73 million of return of capital from equity method investees.
Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, for the year ended December31, 2012 were $1.6 billion, including $1.7 billion of share repurchases, including $1.0 billion from Barclays, $500 million in open market transactions, and $0.2 billion of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, $1.1 billion of payments for cash dividends and a $0.5 billion repayment of long-term debt. Cash outflows from financing activities were partially offset by cash inflows related to $1.5 billion of net proceeds from long-term borrowings, $74 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and $47 million of proceeds from stock options exercised.
Capital Resources The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December31, 2012 and 2011 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December31, 2012 December31, 2011 Variance Amount %Change Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,606 $ 3,506 $ 1,100 31 % Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds (1) (133 ) (196 ) 63 32 % Subtotal 4,473 3,310 1,163 35 % Credit facility  undrawn 3,685 3,400 285 8 % Total liquidity $ 8,158 $ 6,710 $ 1,448 22 % (1) The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities.
Total liquidity increased $1.4 billion during 2012, primarily reflecting positive operating cash flows, proceeds from long-term debt issuances in May 2012 and the increased aggregate commitment of the 2012 credit facility from $3.5 billion to $3.785 billion, partially offset by share repurchases, including $1.0 billion from Barclays and $500 million in open market transactions, and the long-term debt repayments of $500 million. A portion of liquidity may be utilized to pay down the current portion of long-term debt maturing in 2013.

As of December31, 2012, there were 2,725,400 shares still authorized to be repurchased, which are included in the total January 2013 Board authorization of 10.2million shares.
Net Capital Requirements.
The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalents in those jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
59 Table of Contents BTC is chartered as a national bank that does not accept client deposits and whose powers are limited to trust activities. BTC provides investment management services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services to institutional investors and other clients. BTC is subject to various regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by Federal banking agencies.

Such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. The Companys current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds.
Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment at December31, 2012: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Short-term borrowings: Principal $ 100 $  $  $  $  $  $ 100 Long-term borrowings (1) : Principal 750 1,000 750  700 2,500 5,700 Interest (2) 200 196 156 151 151 342 1,196 Operating leases 134 122 113 104 105 784 1,362 Purchase obligations 78 70 34 23 8  213 Investment commitments 235      235 Total contractual obligations and commitments 1,497 1,388 1,053 278 964 3,626 8,806 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 179      179 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations (3) $ 1,676 $ 1,388 $ 1,053 $ 278 $ 964 $ 3,626 $ 8,985 (1) Long-term borrowings exclude the borrowings of consolidated CLOs. The Company has no obligation to settle the liabilities of these CLOs.
(2) Interest payable on the 2013 floating rate notes was calculated using a fixed rate of 1.03% as a result of the interest rate swap entered into in conjunction with the obligation.
(3) As of December31, 2012, the Company had $313 million of net unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the uncertainty of timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, this amount has been excluded from the table above.
Short-term Borrowings.
The following describes the Companys short-term borrowing arrangements that the Company has access to utilize.
2012 Revolving Credit Facility .
In March 2012, the 2011 credit facility was amended to extend the maturity date by one year to March 2017 and in April 2012 the amount of the aggregate commitment was increased to $3.785 billion (the 2012 credit facility). The 2012 credit facility permits the Company to request an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2012 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $4.785 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The 2012 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December31, 2012.
The 2012 credit facility provides back-up liquidity, funds ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and funds various investment opportunities. At December31, 2012, the Company had $100 million 60 Table of Contents outstanding under this facility with an interest rate of 1.085% and a maturity during January 2013. During January 2013, the Company rolled over the $100 million in borrowings at an interest rate of 1.085% and a maturity during February 2013. During February 2013, the Company rolled over the $100 million in borrowings at an interest rate of 1.075% and a maturity during March 2013.
Commercial Paper Program.
On October14, 2009, BlackRock established a commercial paper program (the CP Program) under which the Company could issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the CP Notes) on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion. On May13, 2011, BlackRock increased the maximum aggregate amount that may be borrowed under the CP Program to $3.5 billion. On May17, 2012, BlackRock increased the maximum aggregate amount to $3.785 billion. The CP Program is currently supported by the 2012 credit facility. As of December31, 2012 and December31, 2011, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.
Long-term Borrowings.
At December31, 2012, the principal amount of long-term borrowings, including current portion, was $5.7 billion.
2017 Notes .
In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes maturing on September15, 2017 (the 2017 Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the 2017 Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March15 and September15 of each year, or approximately $44 million per year. The 2017 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make-whole redemption price.
2012, 2014 and 2019 Notes .
In December 2009, the Company issued $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as three separate series of senior debt securities including $0.5 billion of 2.25% notes, which were repaid in December 2012, and $1.0 billion of 3.50% notes and $1.0 billion of 5.0% notes maturing in December 2014 and 2019, respectively. Net proceeds of this offering were used to repay borrowings under the CP program, which was used to finance a portion of the BGI Transaction, and for general corporate purposes. These notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make-whole redemption price. Interest on the 2014 Notes and 2019 Notes of approximately $35 million and $50 million per year, respectively, is payable semi-annually in arrears on June10 and December10 of each year. In 2012, approximately $96 million of interest was paid related to the 2012, 2014 and 2019 Notes.
2013 and 2021 Notes.
In May 2011, the Company issued $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as two separate series of senior debt securities including $750 million of 4.25% notes and $750 million of floating rate notes maturing in May 2021 and 2013, respectively. Net proceeds of this offering were used to fund the repurchase of BlackRocks Series B Preferred from affiliates of Merrill Lynch. Interest on the 4.25% notes due in 2021 (2021 Notes) is payable semi-annually on May24 and November24 of each year, which commenced November24, 2011, and is approximately $32 million per year. Interest on the floating rate notes due in 2013 (2013 Floating Rate Notes) is payable quarterly on February24,May24,August24 and November24 of each year. The 2021 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make-whole redemption price. The 2013 Floating Rate Notes may not be redeemed at the Companys option before maturity.
In May 2011, in conjunction with the issuance of the 2013 Floating Rate Notes, the Company entered into a $750 million notional interest rate swap maturing in 2013 to hedge the future cash flows of its obligation at a fixed rate of 1.03% payable semi-annually on May24 and November24 of each year, which commenced November24, 2011. The interest rate swap effectively converts the 2013 Floating Rate Notes to a fixed rate obligation.
2015 and 2022 Notes.
In May 2012, the Company issued $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as two separate series of senior debt securities, including $750 million of 1.375% notes maturing in June 2015 (the 2015 Notes) and $750 million of 3.375% notes maturing in June 2022 (the 2022 Notes). Net proceeds were used to fund the repurchase of BlackRocks common stock and Series B Preferred from Barclays and affiliates and for general corporate purposes. Interest on the 2015 Notes and 2022 Notes of approximately $10 million and $25 million per year, respectively, is payable semi-annually on June1 and December1 of each year, which commenced December1, 2012. The 2015 Notes and 2022 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make-whole redemption price. The make-whole redemption price represents a price, subject to the specific terms of the 2015 and 2022 Notes and related indenture, that is the greater of (a)par value and (b)the present value of future 61 Table of Contents payments that will not be paid because of an early redemption, which is discounted at a fixed spread over a comparable Treasury security.
Operating Leases.
The Company leases its primary office locations under agreements that expire on varying dates through 2035. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
Purchase Obligations.
In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts, which are either non-cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December31, 2012, the Companys obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for portfolio, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December31, 2012.
Investment Commitments.
At December31, 2012, the Company had $235 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds, including funds of private equity funds, real estate funds and distressed credit funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party non-controlling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company, but which are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
Carried Interest Claw-back.
As a general partner in certain investment funds, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw-back provisions in investments, or cash to the extent that it is distributed, as a deferred carried interest liability on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is realized and recorded as performance fees on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically improbable.
Indemnifications.
In many of the Companys contracts, including the BGI, MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December31, 2012. See further discussion in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.
On behalf of certain clients the Company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential losses resulting from a borrowers failure to fulfill its obligations should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrowers obligations under the securities lending agreement. The amount of securities on loan as of December31, 2012 and subject to indemnification was $99.5 billion. The Company held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $104.8 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December31, 2012. As part of the Barclays Global Investors (BGI) acquisition, Barclays was contractually obligated to continue providing counterparty default indemnification to certain BlackRock securities lending clients through December1, 2012. BlackRock assumed these indemnification obligations prior to or upon the expiration of Barclays indemnification obligation. The amount of client balances indemnified increased in the fourth quarter 2012 due to the Companys assumption of Barclays indemnification obligations on December1, 2012. The fair value of these indemnifications was not 62 Table of Contents material at December31, 2012. The Company currently expects indemnified balances to continue to increase over time.
While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrowers obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the Company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the Company has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way, guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested.
Contingent Distribution Obligations.
In November 2010, BlackRock entered into a second amended and restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch, which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of AUM maintained in certain BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three-year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The obligation for 2014, 2015 and 2016 is not included in the table above as the amounts are not currently determinable.
The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and Benefit Obligations.
The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table contractual obligations and commitments above. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13, Stock-Based Compensation, and 14, Employee Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December31, 2012 totaled $1,547 million and included incentive compensation of $1,168 million, deferred compensation of $137 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $242 million. Substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2013, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years.
Separate Account Liabilities.
At December31, 2012, the Company had $134.8 billion of separate account assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
Short-Term Investment Funds.
Barclays has provided capital support agreements to support certain cash management funds acquired by BlackRock in the BGI Transaction.Pursuant to the terms of the capital support agreements, Barclays agreed to cover losses on covered securities within the products in the aggregate of up to $2.2 billion from December1, 2009 through December1, 2013 or until certain criteria were met.BlackRock and Barclays have procedures in place to determine loss events on covered securities within the products and to ensure support payments from Barclays. On October9, 2012, BlackRock, on behalf of two of these funds, negotiated amendments to these capital support agreements to release Barclays from coverage provided for defaults on 51 covered securities (with an estimated value of approximately $750 million) held in the funds in exchange for a payment by Barclays to the funds of $70 million.The payment was in an amount in excess of the payments that were expected under the Barclays capital support agreements. The Barclays capital support agreements continued in effect for the remaining covered securities in these two funds, and after this transaction, at October10, 2012, Barclays remaining potential obligation in the aggregate under the capital support agreements was $1.6 billion. The support agreements for these two funds had a termination date of December1, 2013 subject to an early termination option in the event that the applicable funds market value remained above a certain net asset value per unit for 120 consecutive days. Barclays exercised its termination option for these two funds on December7, 2012 and January3, 2013. After these terminations, at January31, 2013, Barclays remaining maximum potential obligation in the aggregate under the capital support agreements was not material.
As previously mentioned, the fourth quarter 2012 results included a one-time $30 million charge related to a contribution to certain of these STIFs. This contribution resulted from actions taken to ensure compliance with new regulations from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) taking effect in July 2013 that further limit a STIFs weighted-average portfolio life maturity.BlackRock chose to sell certain securities held within STIFs and to make a one-time contribution to the STIFs to maintain the value of the funds while ensuring compliance with the new OCC rules. The securities sold were held in funds managed by BGI prior to BlackRocks 63 Table of Contents acquisition of BGI.Until adoption of the new STIF regulations, BlackRock had been pursuing a strategy to hold these securities as market values improved over time.As a result of the fourth quarter security sales, these STIFs are currently in compliance with the new OCC rules.
At December31, 2012, BlackRock concluded that although these funds were VIEs, it was not the primary beneficiary (PB) of these funds.
Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.
Consolidation of Sponsored Investment Funds and Securitization Products . Consolidation of sponsored investment funds and securitization products (collectively investment products) is determined pursuant to ASC 810, Consolidation . The accounting method used by the Company depends upon the influence the Company has over its investee, the investment product. To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investment product, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, BlackRock consolidates the investment product.
For investment products in which BlackRocks voting interest is less than 50%, an analysis is performed to determine if the investment product is a VIE or a voting rights entity. Upon the determination that the investment product is a VIE, further analysis, as discussed below, is performed to determine if BlackRock is the PB of the investment product, which would require consolidation.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities . Certain investment products for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests may be deemed VIEs. BlackRock reviews factors, including the rights of the equity holders and obligations of equity holders to absorb losses or receive expected residual returns, to determine if the investment product is a VIE. BlackRock is required to consolidate a VIE when it is deemed to be the PB, which is evaluated continuously as facts and circumstances change.
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010-10, Amendments to Statement 167 for Certain Investment Funds (ASU 2010-10) defers the application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No.46(R), for certain investment funds, including money market funds. The PB of a VIE that meets the conditions of ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests, including those of related parties) that absorbs the majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both. Effective January1, 2010, the PB of a VIE that does not meet the conditions for deferral in ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE.
Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. If the Company is determined to be the PB of a VIE, BlackRock will consolidate the entity. In order to determine whether the Company is the PB of a VIE for entities that meet the conditions of ASU 2010-10, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of projected future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes.
In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles, including collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) or CLOs that do not meet the conditions of ASU 2010-10 and sponsored investment funds, which may be considered VIEs.
64 Table of Contents At December31, 2012, the following balances related to consolidated VIEs including CLOs and an investment fund on the consolidated statements of financial condition: (Dollar amounts in millions) CLOs Sponsored Private EquityFund Total Consolidated VIEs Assets of consolidated VIEs: Cash and cash equivalents $ 294 $ 3 $ 297 Bank loans, bonds and other investments 2,240 24 2,264 Liabilities of consolidated VIEs: Borrowings (2,402 )  (2,402 ) Other liabilities (103 )  (103 ) Appropriated retained earnings (29 )  (29 ) Non-controlling interests of consolidated VIEs  (27 ) (27 ) Total BlackRock net interests in consolidated VIEs $  $  $  At December31, 2012, BlackRock was the manager of over 20 CLOs/CDOs and other securitization entities.In accordance with consolidation accounting guidance for VIEs, BlackRock was determined to be the PB for certain of these CLOs, which required BlackRock to consolidate these VIEs. BlackRock was deemed to be the PB because it has the power to direct the activities of the CLO that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. At December31, 2012, the Company had $2,534million and $2,505 million in assets and liabilities, respectively, on its consolidated statement of financial condition related to these consolidated CLOs. In addition, the Company recorded appropriated retained earnings for the difference between the assets and liabilities, as the CLO noteholders, not BlackRock, ultimately will receive the benefits or absorb the losses associated with the CLOs assets and liabilities. The changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of these CLOs have no impact on net income attributable to BlackRock or its cash flows. Excluding outstanding management fee receivables, the Company has no risk of loss with its involvement with these VIEs.
At December31, 2012, BlackRock was determined to be the PB of one sponsored private equity investment fund of funds in which it had a non-substantive investment and was deemed to absorb the majority of the variability due to its de-facto third-party relationships with other partners in the fund, which limits the ability of the partners to transfer or sell their interests without BlackRocks consent as the general partner of the fund. At December31, 2012, the Company had recorded $3 million, $24 million and $27 million in cash and cash equivalents, private equity investments and nonredeemable non-controlling interests of consolidated VIEs, respectively, on the consolidated statement of financial condition related to this VIE. The changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of this VIE have no impact on net income attributable to BlackRock. Excluding outstanding management fee receivables, the Company has no risk of loss with its involvement with this VIE.
Consolidation of Voting Rights Entities . To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, BlackRock consolidates the investee.
The Company, as general partner or managing member of certain sponsored investment funds, generally is presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to ASC 810-20, Control of Partnerships and Similar Entities (ASC 810-20), the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining whether other non-affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have other substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, BlackRock will consolidate the investment vehicle.
65 Table of Contents At December31, 2012 and 2011, as a result of consolidation of various investment products deemed to be voting rights entities, including products where BlackRock owns 50% of greater of the voting rights of the product, under the consolidation policies described above, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: (Dollar amounts in millions) December31, 2012 December31, 2011 Cash and cash equivalents $ 133 $ 196 Investments: Trading investments 123 214 Other investments 401 373 Other assets 25 5 Other liabilities (65 ) (37 ) Non-controlling interests (187 ) (276 ) BlackRocks net interests in consolidated investment funds $ 430 $ 475 The Company retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to ASC 810-10. VIEs, including a consolidated sponsored investment fund and CLOs, were excluded from the balances above as these balances are reported separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
Investments Equity Method Investments . For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where it is not the PB of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company follows the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement, including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity.
Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies that record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non-operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such investees are considered to be an extension of BlackRocks core business.
At December31, 2012, the Company had $604 million and $124 million of equity method investments, including equity method investments held for deferred compensation, reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December31, 2011, the Company had $476 million and $80 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively.
Impairment of Investment s. The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of income.
When the fair value of available-for-sale securities is lower than cost, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary.
In making this determination for equity securities, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statement of income.
In making this determination for debt securities, the Company considers whether: (1)it has the intent to sell the security, (2)it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery or (3)it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security, but the security has suffered a credit loss, the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total 66 Table of Contents impairment and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Evaluation of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income.
Fair Value Measurements Hierarchy of Fair Value Inputs .
The provisions of ASC 820-10 establish a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and require companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.
Assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date.
Level 1 assets may include listed mutual funds (including those accounted for under the equity method of accounting as these mutual funds are investment companies that have publicly available net asset values (NAVs), which in accordance with GAAP, are calculated under fair value measures and the changes are equal to the earnings of such funds), ETFs, listed equities and certain exchange-traded derivatives.
Level 2 Inputs: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; quotes from pricing services or brokers for which the Company can determine that orderly transactions took place at the quoted price or that the inputs used to arrive at the price were observable; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. As a practical expedient, the Company relies on the NAV (or its equivalent) of certain investments as their fair value.
Level 2 assets may include debt securities, bank loans, short-term floating rate notes and asset-backed securities, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain equity method limited partnership interests in hedge funds valued based on NAV (or its equivalent) where the Company has the ability to redeem at the measurement date or within the near term without redemption restrictions, restricted public securities valued at a discount, as well as overthe-counter derivatives, including interest and inflation rate swaps and foreign exchange currency contracts that have inputs to the valuations that generally can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability, which may include non-binding broker quotes. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Certain investments that are valued using NAV (or its equivalent) and are subject to current redemption restrictions that will not be lifted in the near term are included in Level 3.
Level 3 assets may include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, direct private equity investments held within consolidated funds, bonds and bank loans.
Level 3 liabilities include borrowings of consolidated CLOs valued based upon non-binding single-broker quotes.
Level 3 inputs include BlackRock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments, including distressed credit hedge funds, real estate and private equity funds, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices. BlackRocks $679 million of Level 3 investments or 39% of total GAAP investments at December31, 2012 primarily included the above mentioned co-investments.
Significance of Inputs .
The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument.
Valuation Techniques .
The fair values of certain Level 3 assets and liabilities were determined using various methodologies as appropriate, including NAVs of underlying investments, third-party pricing vendors, broker quotes and market and income approaches. Such quotes and modeled prices are evaluated for reasonableness through various procedures, including due diligence reviews of third-party pricing vendors, variance analyses, consideration of current market environment and other analytical procedures.
67 Table of Contents As a practical expedient, the Company relies on NAV as the fair value for certain investments. The inputs to value these investments may include BlackRock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments, including distressed credit hedge funds, real estate and private equity funds, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices. The various partnerships are investment companies, which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally require the fund to utilize pricing/valuation information, including independent appraisals, from third-party sources. However, in some instances, current valuation information for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active may not be available from any third-party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third-party sources are not reliable. In these instances, fund management may perform model-based analytical valuations that may be used as an input to value these investments.
A significant amount of inputs used to value equity, debt securities and bank loans is sourced from well-recognized third-party pricing vendors. Generally, prices obtained from pricing vendors are categorized as Level1 inputs for identical securities traded in active markets and as Level 2 for other similar securities if the vendor uses observable inputs in determining the price. Annually, BlackRocks internal valuation committee or other designated groups review both the valuation methodology, including the general assumptions and methods used to value various asset classes, and operational process with these vendors. In addition, on a quarterly basis, meetings are held with the vendors to identify any significant changes to the vendors processes.
In addition, quotes obtained from brokers generally are non-binding and categorized as Level 3 inputs. However, if the Company is able to determine that market participants have transacted for the asset in an orderly manner near the quoted price or if the Company can determine that the inputs used by the broker are observable, the quote is classified as a Level 2 input.
Changes in Valuation .
Changes in value on $1,275 million of investments will impact the Companys non-operating income (expense), $158 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income, $232 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $85 million relates to carried interest which will not impact non-operating income (expense). As of December31, 2012, changes in fair value of approximately $524 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will impact BlackRocks net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds was $430 million.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets The value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage AUM in proprietary open- and closed-end investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with the applicable provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (ASC 350), indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite-lived management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date, are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December31, 2012, ranged from 1 to 12 years with a weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of 4.9 years.
Goodwill . The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. The impairment test performed as of July31, 2012 indicated that no impairment charge was required. The Company continuously monitors its book value per share as compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December31, 2012, the Companys common stock closed at $206.71, which exceeded its book value per share of approximately $148.20 after excluding appropriated retained earnings.
Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles . The Company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are potentially impaired and whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than its carrying value, BlackRock assesses various significant factors including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. In addition, the Company considers other factors including: (i)macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign 68 Table of Contents exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii)industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entitys services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii)entity-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs.
If potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.
In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $157 million, $156 million and $160 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
In 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company performed impairment tests that indicated no impairment charges were required, the classification of indefinite-lived versus finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles were required. The Company continuously monitors various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment.
Income Taxes.
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, that require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December31, 2012, BlackRock had $404 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $250 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
In accordance with ASC 740, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. At December31, 2012, the Company had deferred tax assets of $4 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $5,293 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. ASC 740 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.
At December31, 2012, the Company had recorded a deferred tax asset of $71 million for unrealized investment losses; however, no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to hold certain equity method investments which invest in fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for further details.
69 Table of Contents The Company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivables of approximately $102 million and current income taxes payables of $121 million at December31, 2012.
Revenue Recognition.
Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate clients, net operating income generated by the underlying properties. Investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers.
The Company contracts with third parties and related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds the Company manages. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that the Company bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with ASC 605-45, Revenue Recognition  Principle Agent Considerations (ASC 605-45), and records its management fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $793 million, $928 million and $831 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties, which due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income.
The Company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. Such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis. The securities loaned are secured by collateral, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. The revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. For 2012, 2011 and 2010, securities lending revenue totaled $510 million, $397 million and $325 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee.
The Company receives investment advisory performance fees or incentive allocation from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified relative and/or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period, which varies by product or account, and could be monthly, quarterly, annually or longer. For the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, performance fee revenue totaled $463 million, $371 million and $540 million, respectively. In addition, the Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investments upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these funds. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw-back provisions in investments or cash to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is realized and recorded as performance fee revenue upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically improbable. The Company records realized carried interest as performance fees on its consolidated statements of income. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had $97 million and $33 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The ultimate recognition of performance fee revenue, if any, for these products is unknown.
Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions , which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i)percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform, (ii)fixed fees and (iii)performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For 2012, 2011 and 2010, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $518 million, $510 million and $460 million, respectively.
Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record performance revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically improbable.
70 Table of Contents Accounting Developments For accounting pronouncements the Company adopted during 2012 and for recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
Recent Developments BlackRock holds an approximately one-third equity interest in Private National Mortgage Acceptance Company, LLC (PennyMac), accounted for as an equity method investment. PennyMac Financial Services, Inc., which is proposed to become a holding company of PennyMac, recently filed a Form S-1 with the SEC to effectively take PennyMac public. A successful offering by PennyMac may require BlackRock to adjust its investment in PennyMac at the time of the offering. Given the uncertain nature of the registration and offering process for PennyMac, the amount and timing of any such potential gains or changes in carrying values is uncertain.
Item7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK AUM Market Price Risk.
BlackRocks investment advisory and administration fees are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December31, 2012, the majority of the Companys investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees.
Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks.
As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that investments be reviewed by certain senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors, depending on the circumstances, for approval.
In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments.
BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including real estate, private equity and hedge funds. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge market exposure to certain investments. At December31, 2012, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $206 million.
At December31, 2012, approximately $524 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Excluding the impact of the Federal Reserve Bank stock, carried interest, investments made to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans and certain investments that are hedged via the seed capital hedging program, the Companys economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: December31, 2012 December31, 2011 Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) Amount %Change Total investments, GAAP $ 1,750 $ 1,631 $ 119 7 % Investments held by consolidated sponsored investment funds (524 ) (587 ) 63 11 % Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 430 475 (45 ) (10 %) Total investments, as adjusted 1,656 1,519 137 9 % Federal Reserve Bank stock (89 ) (328 ) 239 73 % Carried interest (85 ) (21 ) (64 ) (305 %) Deferred compensation investments (62 ) (65 ) 3 5 % Hedged investments (209 ) (43 ) (166 ) (386 %) Total economic investment exposure $ 1,211 $ 1,062 $ 149 14 % 71 Table of Contents The economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the equity market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Equity Market Price Risk.
At December31, 2012, the Companys net exposure to market price risk in its investment portfolio was approximately $609 million of the Companys total economic investment exposure. Investments subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments, hedge funds and funds of funds as well as mutual funds. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $60.9 million in the carrying value of such investments.
Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk.
At December31, 2012, the Company was exposed to interest-rate risk and credit spread risk as a result of approximately $602 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $8.0 million in the carrying value of such investments.
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk.
As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the total economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the pound sterling and euro was $156 million at December31, 2012. A 10% adverse change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $15.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments.
Other Market Risks.
By using derivative financial instruments, the Company exposes itself to market risk. Market risk from forward foreign currency exchange contracts is the effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in currency exchange rates. The Company manages exposure to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degrees of market risk that may be undertaken. At December31, 2012, the Company had outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate notional value of approximately $79 million.

Item9.
CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE There have been no disagreements on accounting and financial disclosure matters. BlackRock has not changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years.
Item9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Under the direction of BlackRocks Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, BlackRock evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, BlackRocks Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that BlackRocks disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Internal Control and Financial Reporting.
There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the latest fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect such internal control over financial reporting.
72 Table of Contents Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of BlackRock, Inc. (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and affected by the Companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with the authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012 based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December31, 2012, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective.
The Companys independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
February28, 2013 73 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BlackRock, Inc.: We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of BlackRock, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statement of financial condition as of December31, 2012 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended of the Company and our report dated February28, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BlackRock, Inc. and subsidiaries at December31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February28, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

Basis of Presentation.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and include the accounts of the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Non-controlling interests on the consolidated statements of financial condition include the portion of consolidated sponsored investment funds in which the Company does not have direct equity ownership. Significant accounts and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Certain items previously reported have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
2. Significant Accounting Policies Cash and Cash Equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents primarily consists of cash, money market funds and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less in which the Company is exposed to market and credit risk. Cash and cash equivalent balances that are legally restricted from use by the Company are recorded in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Cash balances maintained by consolidated sponsored investment funds are not considered legally restricted and are included in cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Cash balances maintained by consolidated VIEs are included in assets of consolidated variable interest entities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
Investments Investments in Debt and Marketable Equity Securities . BlackRock holds debt and marketable equity investments, which pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 320-10, Investments  Debt and Equity Securities, are classified as trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity based on the Companys intent to sell the security or, for a debt security, the Companys intent and ability to hold the debt security to maturity.
Trading securities are those investments that are purchased principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change.
F-11 Table of Contents 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Held-to-maturity debt securities are purchased with the positive intent and ability to be held to maturity and are recorded at amortized cost on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
Available-for-sale securities are those securities that are not classified as trading or held-to-maturity. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of stockholders equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available-for-sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income.
Equity Method . For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where it is not the primary beneficiary (PB) of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company follows the equity method of accounting in accordance with ASC 323, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures . Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is recorded as net gain (loss) on investments within non-operating income (expense) and as other revenue for operating advisory company investments since such companies are considered to be an extension of BlackRocks core business. BlackRocks share of net income of the investee is recorded based upon the most current information available at the time, which may precede the date of the consolidated statement of financial condition. Distributions received from the investment reduce the Companys carrying value of the investee.
Cost Method . For non-marketable equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received from the investment are recorded as dividend income within non-operating income (expense).
Impairments of Investments . The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of income.
When the fair value of available-for-sale securities is lower than cost, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary.
In making this determination for equity securities, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income.
In making this determination for debt securities, the Company considers whether: (1)it has the intent to sell the security, (2)it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery or (3)it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security, but the security has suffered a credit loss, the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total impairment and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Consolidation For investment products in which BlackRocks voting interest is less than 50%, an analysis is performed to determine if the investment product is a VIE or a voting rights entity. Upon the determination that the investment product is a VIE, further analysis, as discussed below, is performed to determine if BlackRock is the PB of the investment product, which would require consolidation.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities . Pursuant to ASC 810-10, Consolidation (ASC810-10) certain investment products for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests may be deemed VIEs. BlackRock reviews factors, including the rights of the equity holders and obligations of equity holders to absorb losses or receive expected residual returns, to determine if the investment product is a VIE. BlackRock is required to consolidate a VIE when it is deemed to be the PB, which is evaluated continuously as facts and circumstances change.
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010-10, Amendments to Statement 167 for Certain Investment Funds (ASU 2010-10) defers the application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) F-12 Table of Contents 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) No.167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No.46(R), for certain investment funds, including money market funds.
The PB of a VIE that is not subject to ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE.
The PB of a VIE that meets the conditions of ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests, including those of related parties) that absorbs the majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both.
Consolidation of Voting Rights Entities . To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, BlackRock consolidates the investee.
The Company, as general partner or managing member of certain sponsored investment funds, generally is presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to ASC 810-20, Control of Partnerships and Similar Entities (ASC 810-20), the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining whether other non-affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or to otherwise remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have other substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, BlackRock will consolidate the investment vehicle.
Retention of Specialized Accounting Principles.
Upon consolidation of certain sponsored investment funds, the Company retains the specialized accounting principles of the underlying funds pursuant to ASC 810-10. All of the underlying investments held by such consolidated sponsored investment funds are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the investments fair values reflected in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. When the Company no longer controls these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method if the Company still maintains an investment.
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities . Separate account assets are maintained by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The separate account assets are not subject to general claims of the creditors of BlackRock. These separate account assets and the related equal and offsetting liabilities are recorded as separate account assets and separate account liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition in accordance with the ASC 944-80, Financial Services  Separate Accounts.
The net investment income attributable to separate account assets supporting individual and group pension contracts accrue directly to the contract owner and are not reported on the consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these separate account assets and liabilities, BlackRock earns policy administration and management fees associated with these products, which are included in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income.
Collateral Assets Held and Liabilities Under Securities Lending Agreements . The Company facilitates securities lending arrangements whereby securities held by separate account assets maintained by BlackRocks life insurance company are lent to third parties. In exchange, the Company receives collateral with minimums generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the securities lent in order to reduce counterparty risk. Under the Companys securities lending arrangements, the Company can resell or re-pledge the collateral and the borrower can resell or re-pledge the loaned securities. The securities lending transactions entered into by the Company are accompanied by an agreement that entitles the Company to request the borrower to return the securities at any time; therefore, these transactions are not reported as sales under ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing.
As a result of the Companys ability to resell or re-pledge the collateral, the Company records on the consolidated statements of financial condition the collateral received under these arrangements (both cash and non-cash) as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. At December31, 2012 and 2011, the fair value of loaned securities held by separate account assets was approximately $21.0 billion and $19.5 billion, respectively, and the collateral held under these securities lending agreements was approximately $23.0 billion and $20.9 billion, respectively. During 2012 and 2011, the Company had not sold or re-pledged any of the collateral received under these arrangements.
F-13 Table of Contents 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Deferred Sales Commissions . The Company holds the rights to receive certain cash flows from sponsored mutual funds sold without a front-end sales charge (back-end load shares). The carrying value of these deferred mutual fund commissions is being amortized over periods between one and six years. The Company receives distribution fees from these funds and contingent deferred sales commissions (CDSCs) upon shareholder redemption of certain back-end load shares that are recorded within distribution fees on the consolidated statements of income. Upon receipt of CDSCs, the Company records revenue and the remaining unamortized deferred sales commission is expensed.
The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of deferred commission assets to determine whether a significant decline in the equity or bond markets or other events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. If indicators of a potential impairment exist, the Company compares the carrying value of the asset to the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows related to the asset. If such assessments indicate that the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows will not be sufficient to recover the recorded carrying value, the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value. No such impairments were recorded for 2012, 2011 and 2010.
Property and Equipment . Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally determined by cost less any estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining lease term.
BlackRock develops a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services for internal use, utilizing proprietary software that is hosted and maintained by BlackRock. In accordance with ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software (ASC 350-40), the Company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are included within property and equipment on the consolidated statements of financial condition and are amortized, beginning when the software project is complete and put into production, over the estimated useful life of the software of approximately three years.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets . Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In its assessment of goodwill for impairment, the Company considers such factors as the book value and market capitalization of the Company. On a quarterly basis, the Company considers if triggering events have occurred that may indicate a potential goodwill impairment. If a triggering event has occurred, the Company performs assessments, which include reviews of all significant valuation assumptions, to determine if goodwill may be impaired. The Company performs an impairment assessment of its goodwill at least annually, as of July31st.
Intangible assets are comprised of indefinite-lived intangible assets and finite-lived intangible assets acquired in a business combination. The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open-end funds, closed-end funds and collective trust funds and certain other commingled products without a specified termination date is generally classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The assignment of indefinite lives to such contracts primarily is based upon the following: (i)the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these products; (ii)the Company expects to, and has the ability to, continue to operate these products indefinitely; (iii)the products have multiple investors and are not reliant on a single investor or small group of investors for their continued operation; (iv)current competitive factors and economic conditions do not indicate a finite life; and (v)there is a high likelihood of continued renewal based on historical experience. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets when they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely.
In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (ASC 350), indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. The value of contracts for separately managed accounts and certain funds, which have finite lives, are amortized over the expected lives of the management contracts.
The Company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are potentially impaired and whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate. The carrying value of finite-lived management contracts and their remaining useful lives are reviewed at least annually to determine if circumstances exist which may indicate a potential impairment. The Company performs such impairment assessments of its intangible assets including indefinite-lived management contracts and trade names/trademarks, at least annually, as of July31 st . In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than its carrying value, BlackRock assesses various significant factors including assets under management (AUM), revenue basis points, F-14 Table of Contents 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. In addition, the Company considers other factors including (i)macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii)industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entitys services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii)entity-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs.
If potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.
Non-controlling Interests.
According to the requirements within ASC 810-10, the Company reports non-controlling interests as equity, separate from the parents equity, on the consolidated statements of financial condition. In addition, the Companys consolidated net income on the consolidated statements of income includes the income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest holders of the Companys consolidated sponsored investment funds and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). Income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests is not adjusted for income taxes for consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs that are treated as pass-through entities for tax purposes.
Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities.
The Company includes redeemable non-controlling interests related to certain consolidated sponsored investment funds in temporary equity on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
Appropriated Retained Earnings . Upon adoption of ASU 2009-17, Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities (ASU 2009-17) on January1, 2010, BlackRock consolidated three CLOs and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to appropriated retained earnings on the consolidated statement of financial condition equal to the difference between the fair value of the CLOs assets and the fair value of their liabilities. Such amounts are recorded as appropriated retained earnings as the CLO noteholders, not BlackRock, ultimately will receive the benefits or absorb the losses associated with the CLOs assets and liabilities. Subsequent to adoption of ASU 2009-17, the net change in the fair value of the CLOs assets and liabilities has been recorded as net income (loss) attributable to nonredeemable non-controlling interests and as an adjustment to appropriated retained earnings. In addition, in 2011, BlackRock consolidated additional CLOs, resulting in $19 million of additional appropriated retained earnings upon the initial consolidation.
Treasury Stock . The Company records common stock purchased for treasury at cost. At the date of subsequent reissuance, the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of such stock using the average cost method.
Revenue Recognition Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue . Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM, committed capital, or, in the case of certain real estate clients, net operating income generated by the underlying properties. Investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers.
The Company contracts with third parties and related parties for various mutual fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds the Company manages. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund (primarily international funds) takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that the Company bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with ASC 605-45, Revenue Recognition  Principal Agent Considerations, and has recorded its management fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $793 million, $928 million and $831 million, respectively, and were reflected net in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income.
F-15 Table of Contents 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) The Company also earns revenue by lending securities as an agent on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. Such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis. The revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed.
Investment Advisory Performance Fees . The Company receives investment advisory performance fees or an incentive allocation from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified relative and/or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which varies by product or account.
The Company may receive carried interest from certain alternative investments upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw-back provisions in investments, or cash on the consolidated statements of financial condition to the extent that it is distributed. Carried interest is realized and recorded as performance fee revenue upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had $97 million and $33 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
BlackRock Solutions and Advisory . BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic, enterprise investment system and financial markets advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions  and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation of illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i)percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin  platform, (ii)fixed fees and (iii)performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. The fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are recorded in BlackRock Solutions and advisory on the consolidated statements of income.
Other Revenue . The Company earns fees for transition management services comprised of commissions from acting as an introducing broker-dealer in buying and selling securities on behalf of the Companys customers. Commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur and are reflected in other revenue on the consolidated statements of income.
The Company earns commissions revenue upon the sale of unit trusts and ClassA mutual funds. Revenue is recorded at the time of the sale of the product.
Other revenue also includes equity method investment earnings related to operating advisory company investments and marketing fees earned for services to distribute iPath  products, which are exchange-traded notes issued by Barclays.
Stock-based Compensation . The Company applies ASC 718-10, Compensation  Stock Compensation (ASC 718-10), which establishes standards for the accounting of transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. Entities are required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The compensation cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service (usually the vesting period) in exchange for the stock-based award.
The Company measures the grant-date fair value of restricted stock units (RSUs) using the Companys share price on the date of grant. For employee share options and instruments with market conditions, the Company uses pricing models. If an equity award is modified after the grant date, incremental compensation cost is recognized for an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification. Awards under the Companys stock-based compensation plans vest over various periods. Compensation cost is recorded by the Company on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of the award as if the award is, in-substance, multiple awards. Compensation cost is reduced by the number of awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting. Forfeiture estimates generally are derived using historical forfeiture information, where available, and are reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly.
F-16 Table of Contents 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) The Company amortizes the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation awards made to retirement-eligible employees over the requisite service period. Upon notification of retirement, the Company accelerates the unamortized portion of the award over the contractually required retirement notification period, if applicable.
Distribution and Servicing Costs . Distribution and servicing costs include payments to third parties and related parties, including Bank of America/Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch), PNC and Barclays, primarily associated with distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Distribution and servicing costs are expensed when incurred.
Direct Fund Expenses . Direct fund expenses, which are expensed as incurred, primarily consist of third-party non-advisory expenses incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of certain index trademarks, reference data for certain indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expenses directly attributable to the non-advisory operations of the fund.
Leases . The Company accounts for its operating leases, which may include escalation clauses, in accordance with ASC840-10, Leases . The Company expenses the lease payments associated with operating leases evenly during the lease term (including rent-free periods) commencing when the Company obtains control over the leased property.
Foreign Exchange . Monetary assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries having non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at exchange rates at the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition. Non-monetary assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries having non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders equity, on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in general and administration expense on the consolidated statements of income. For 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions of $(8) million, $(1) million and $6 million, respectively.
Income Taxes . The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740-10, Income Taxes (ASC 740-10). Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred income tax assets based upon expected future earnings, taxable income in prior carryback years, future deductibility of the asset, changes in applicable tax laws and other factors. If management determines that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance will be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in additional income tax expense. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax position.
Excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation are recognized as additional paid-in capital and are reflected as financing cash flows on the consolidated statements of cash flows. If the Company does not have additional paid-in capital credits (cumulative tax benefits recorded to additional paid-in capital), the Company will record an expense for any deficit, or shortfall, between the recorded tax benefit and tax return benefit. At December31, 2012 and 2011, BlackRock had excess additional paid-in capital credits to absorb potential future deficits between recorded tax benefits and tax return benefits.
Earnings per Share (EPS) . EPS is calculated pursuant to the two-class method as defined in ASC 260-10, Earnings per Share (ASC260-10), which specifies that all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities and should be included in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class method. The dilutive effect of outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that are considered non-participating securities are calculated under the treasury stock method.
The Company presents both basic and diluted EPS amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to shareholders, excluding participating securities, by the F-17 Table of Contents 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) weighted-average number of shares outstanding. The Companys participating securities consist of its unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents. Diluted EPS includes the determinants of basic EPS and, in addition, reflects the impact of other potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of participating securities is calculated under the more dilutive of either the treasury stock method or the two-class method. As of December31, 2012, there were approximately 0.2million of participating securities. The majority of these participating securities vested on January31, 2013.
Due to the similarities in terms among each series of BlackRocks non-voting participating preferred stock and the Companys common stock, the Company considers each series of its non-voting participating preferred stock to be common stock equivalents for purposes of EPS calculations.
Business Segments . The Companys management directs BlackRocks operations as one business, the asset management business. As such, the Company operates in one business segment as defined in ASC280-10, Segment Reporting (ASC280-10).
Business Combinations . The Company accounts for business combinations in accordance with the requirements of ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805). The fundamental requirement of ASC 805 is that the acquisition method of accounting (the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. The provisions of ASC 805 define the acquirer, establish the acquisition date and define transactions that qualify as business combinations.
Additionally, the requirements of ASC 805 provide guidance for measuring the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, provide guidance for the measurement of fair value in a step acquisition, provide guidance for recognizing assets acquired and liabilities assumed subject to contingencies, provide guidance on recognition and measurement of contingent consideration and require that acquisition-related costs of the acquirer generally be expensed as incurred. Reversal of valuation allowances related to acquired deferred tax assets and changes to liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions assumed in business combinations subsequent to the adoption of the requirements of ASC 805, will affect the income tax provision in the period of reversal or change.
Fair Value Measurements.
Hierarchy of Fair Value Inputs . The provisions of ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820-10), establish a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and require companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.
Assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date.
Level 1 assets may include listed mutual funds (including those accounted for under the equity method of accounting as these mutual funds are investment companies that have publicly available net asset values (NAVs), which in accordance with GAAP, are calculated under fair value measures and the changes are equal to the earnings of such funds), ETFs, listed equities and certain exchange-traded derivatives.
Level 2 Inputs: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; quotes from pricing services or brokers for which the Company can determine that orderly transactions took place at the quoted price or that the inputs used to arrive at the price are observable; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. As a practical expedient, the Company relies on the NAV (or its equivalent) of certain investments as their fair value.
Level 2 assets may include debt securities, bank loans, short-term floating rate notes and asset-backed securities, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain equity method limited partnership interests in hedge funds valued based on NAV (or its equivalent) where the Company has the ability to redeem at the measurement date or within the near term without redemption restrictions, restricted public securities valued at a discount, as well as over-the-counter derivatives, including interest and inflation rate swaps and F-18 Table of Contents 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) foreign currency exchange contracts that have inputs to the valuations that generally can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability, which may include non-binding broker quotes. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Certain investments that are valued using a NAV (or its equivalent) and are subject to current redemption restrictions that will not be lifted in the near term are included in Level 3.
Level 3 assets may include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds, direct private equity investments held within consolidated funds, bank loans and bonds.
Level 3 liabilities include borrowings of consolidated CLOs valued based upon non-binding single-broker quotes.
Level 3 inputs include BlackRock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments, including distressed credit hedge funds, real estate and private equity funds, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices.
Significance of Inputs . The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument.
Valuation Techniques.
The fair values of certain Level 3 assets and liabilities were determined using various methodologies as appropriate, including NAVs of underlying investments, third-party pricing vendors, broker quotes and market and income approaches. Such quotes and modeled prices are evaluated for reasonableness through various procedures, including due diligence reviews of third-party pricing vendors, variance analyses, consideration of current market environment and other analytical procedures.
As a practical expedient, the Company relies on NAV as the fair value for certain investments. The inputs to value these investments may include BlackRock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments, including distressed credit hedge funds, real estate and private equity funds, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices. The various partnerships are investment companies, which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally require the fund to utilize pricing/valuation information, including independent appraisals, from third-party sources. However, in some instances, current valuation information for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active may not be available from any third-party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third-party sources are not reliable. In these instances, fund management may perform model-based analytical valuations that may be used as an input to value these investments.
A significant amount of inputs used to value equity, debt securities and bank loans is sourced from well-recognized third-party pricing vendors. Generally, prices obtained from pricing vendors are categorized as Level1 inputs for identical securities traded in active markets and as Level 2 for other similar securities if the vendor uses observable inputs in determining the price. Annually, BlackRocks internal valuation committee or other designated groups review both the valuation methodology, including the general assumptions and methods used to value various asset classes, and operational process with these vendors. In addition, on a quarterly basis, meetings are held with the vendors to identify any significant changes to the vendors processes.
In addition, quotes obtained from brokers generally are non-binding and categorized as Level 3 inputs. However, if the Company is able to determine that market participants have transacted for the asset in an orderly manner near the quoted price or if the Company can determine that the inputs used by the broker are observable, the quote is classified as a Level 2 input.
Fair Value Option . ASC 825-10, Financial Instruments (ASC 825-10), provides a fair value option election that allows companies an irrevocable election to use fair value as the initial and subsequent accounting measurement attribute for certain financial assets and liabilities. ASC 825-10 permits entities to elect to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value on an ongoing basis. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. The decision to elect the fair value option is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis, must be applied to an entire instrument and is irrevocable once elected. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value pursuant to ASC 825-10 are required to be reported F-19 Table of Contents 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) separately from those instruments measured using another accounting method.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . ASC 815-10, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC815-10), establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivatives embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. ASC 815-10 generally requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition and to measure those investments at fair value.
The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging: (i)exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of certain assets and liabilities, (ii)market exposures for certain seed investments and (iii)future cash flows on floating rate notes. The Company may also use derivatives within separate account assets, which are segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. In addition, certain consolidated sponsored investment funds may also invest in derivatives as a part of their investment strategy.
Changes in the fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments are generally recognized in current earnings and, where applicable, are offset by the corresponding gain or loss on the related foreign-denominated assets or liabilities or hedged investments, on the consolidated statements of income.
Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2012 Amendments to Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.
On January1, 2012, the Company adopted the applicable provisions of ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (ASU 2011-04). Among other things, ASU 2011-04 clarified existing fair value measurement guidance and required enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. The adoption of ASU 2011-04 did not materially impact the consolidated financial statements.
Amendments on Testing Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets for Impairment.
On July27, 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2012-02, Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment (ASU 2012-02), which amends the guidance in ASC 350-30 on testing indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, for impairment. Under ASU 2012-02, an entity testing an indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment has the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the asset. If the entity determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) impaired, the entity would not need to calculate the fair value of the asset. The Companys adoption of ASU 2012-02 during 2012 did not impact its consolidated financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted Disclosures About Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.
On December16, 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Disclosures About Offsetting Assets and Liabilities (ASU2011-11), which creates new disclosure requirements about the nature of an entitys rights of setoff and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. The provisions of ASU 2011-11 are effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning January1, 2013 with retrospective application required.On January31, 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-01, Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities (ASU 2013-01) that provides clarification about which instruments and transactions are subject to ASU 2011-11. The adoption of ASU 2011-11 and ASU 2013-01 are not expected to materially impact the consolidated financial statements.
Comprehensive Income.
On February5, 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU 2013-02). ASU 2013-02 does not change the current requirement for reporting net income or other comprehensive income but requires additional disclosures about significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. ASU 2013-02 is effective prospectively for the Company on January1, 2013 and is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated statements.

Equity method investments primarily include BlackRocks direct investment in certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds.
Cost method investments include non-marketable securities, including Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) stock, which is held for regulatory purposes and is restricted from sale. At December31, 2012 and 2011, there were no indicators of impairment on these investments. The decrease in cost method investments from December31, 2011 was primarily due to a lower holding requirement of FRB stock held by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
Carried interest represents allocations to BlackRock general partner capital accounts for certain funds. These balances are subject to change upon cash distributions, additional allocations, or reallocations back to limited partners within the respective funds.
F-22 Table of Contents 4. Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment funds primarily because it is deemed to control such funds in accordance with GAAP. The investments owned by these consolidated sponsored investment funds are classified as trading or other investments. The following table presents the balances related to these consolidated funds that were included on the consolidated statements of financial condition as well as BlackRocks net interest in these funds: (Dollar amounts in millions) December31, 2012 December31, 2011 Cash and cash equivalents $ 133 $ 196 Investments: Trading investments 123 214 Other investments 401 373 Other assets 25 5 Other liabilities (65 ) (37 ) Non-controlling interests (187 ) (276 ) BlackRocks net interests in consolidated investment funds $ 430 $ 475 BlackRocks total exposure to consolidated sponsored investment funds of $430 million and $475 million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, represents the value of the Companys economic ownership interest in these sponsored investment funds. Valuation changes associated with these consolidated investment funds are reflected in non-operating income (expense) and partially offset in net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests for the portion not attributable to BlackRock.
In addition, at December31, 2012 and 2011, several consolidated CLOs and one investment fund, which were deemed to be VIEs, were excluded from the balances in the table above as the balances for these investment products are reported separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition. See Note 6, Variable Interest Entities, for further discussion on these consolidated funds.
The Company may not be readily able to access cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company may not be readily able to sell investments held by consolidated sponsored investment funds in order to obtain cash for use in the Companys operations.

F-26 Table of Contents 5. Fair Value Disclosures (continued) Level 3 Assets.
Level 3 assets recorded within investments of $679 million at December31, 2012 primarily related to equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds. Level 3 assets within investments, except for direct investments in private equity companies held by private equity funds described below, were primarily valued based upon NAVs received from internal as well as third-party fund managers.
Direct investments in private equity companies held by private equity funds totaled $56 million at December31, 2012. Direct investments in private equity companies may be valued using the market approach or the income approach, or a combination thereof, and were valued based on an assessment of each underlying investment, incorporating evaluation of additional significant third-party financing, changes in valuations of comparable peer companies, the business environment of the companies, market indices, assumptions relating to appropriate risk adjustments for nonperformance and legal restrictions on disposition, among other factors. The fair value derived from the methods used are evaluated and weighted, as appropriate, considering the reasonableness of the range of values indicated. Under the market approach, fair value may be determined by reference to multiples of market-comparable companies or transactions, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiples. Under the income approach, fair value may be determined by discounting the cash flows to a single present amount using current market expectations about those future amounts.
Unobservable inputs used in a discounted cash flow model may include projections of operating performance generally covering a five-year period and a terminal value of the private equity direct investment. For securities utilizing the discounted cash flow valuation technique, a significant increase (decrease) in the discount rate, risk premium or discount for lack of marketability in isolation could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. For securities utilizing the market comparable companies valuation technique, a significant increase (decrease) in the EBITDA multiple in isolation could result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.
Level 3 assets recorded within separate account assets include single-broker non-binding quotes for fixed income securities and equity securities that have unobservable inputs due to certain corporate actions.
Level 3 assets of consolidated VIEs include bank loans and bonds valued based on single-broker non-binding quotes and direct private equity investments and private equity funds valued based upon valuations received from internal as well as third-party fund managers, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices.
Level 3 Liabilities.
Level 3 liabilities recorded as borrowings of consolidated VIEs include CLO borrowings valued based upon single-broker non-binding quotes.

Realized and unrealized gains (losses) recorded for Level 3 assets and liabilities are reported in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. A portion of net income (loss) for consolidated investments and all of the net income (loss) for consolidated VIEs are allocated to non-controlling interests to reflect net income (loss) not attributable to the Company.
Transfers in and/or out of Levels.
Transfers in and/or out of levels are reflected when significant inputs, including market inputs or performance attributes, used for the fair value measurement become observable / unobservable, or when the Company determines it has the ability, or no longer has the ability, to redeem, in the near term, certain investments that the Company values using a NAV (or a capital account), or when the book value of certain equity method investments no longer represents fair value as determined under fair value methodologies.

(2) The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, due from related parties, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, due to related parties and short-term borrowings approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.
(3) Long-term borrowings are recorded at amortized cost. The fair value of the long-term borrowings, including the current portion of long-term borrowings, is estimated using market prices at the end of December 2012 and December 2011, respectively. See Note 11, Borrowings, for the fair value of the Companys long-term borrowings.
Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value Per Share As a practical expedient to value certain investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value and have attributes of an investment company, the Company relies on NAV as the fair value for certain investments. The following table lists information regarding all investments that use a fair value measurement to account for both their financial assets and financial liabilities in their calculation of a NAV per share (or its equivalent).

Due to the nature of the investments in this category, the Company reduces its investment by distributions that are received through the realization of the underlying assets of the funds. It is estimated that the underlying assets of these funds will be liquidated over a weighted-average period of approximately seven and eight years at December31, 2012 and December31, 2011, respectively. The total remaining unfunded commitments to other third-party funds were $32 million and $44 million at December31, 2012 and December31, 2011, respectively. The Company was contractually obligated to fund $30 million and $33 million at December31, 2012 and December31, 2011 to the consolidated funds, while the remaining unfunded balances in the tables above are required to be funded by capital contributions from non-controlling interest holders.

F-33 Table of Contents 5. Fair Value Disclosures (continued) Fair Value Option.
Upon initial consolidation of CLOs, the Company elects to adopt the fair value option provisions for eligible assets and liabilities, including bank loans and borrowings of the CLOs to mitigate accounting mismatches between the carrying value of the assets and liabilities and to achieve operational simplification. To the extent there is a difference between the change in fair value of the assets and liabilities, the difference will be reflected as net income (loss) attributable to nonredeemable non-controlling interests on the consolidated statements of income and offset by a change in appropriated retained earnings on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
The following table summarizes information related to those assets and liabilities selected for fair value accounting as of December31, 2012 and 2011: (Dollar amounts in millions) December31, 2012 December31, 2011 CLO Bank Loans: Aggregate principal amounts outstanding $ 2,124 $ 1,522 Fair value $ 2,110 $ 1,459 Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value $ 14 $ 63 Unpaid principal balance of loans more than 90 days past due $ 4 $ 4 Aggregate fair value of loans more than 90 days past due $  $  Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value for loans more than 90 days past due $ 4 $ 4 CLO Borrowings: Aggregate principal amounts outstanding $ 2,535 $ 1,781 Fair value $ 2,402 $ 1,574 At December31, 2012, the principal amounts outstanding of the borrowings issued by the CLOs mature between 2016 and 2025.
During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the change in fair value of the bank loans and bonds held by the CLOs resulted in a $154 million gain, a $57 million gain and a $148 million gain, respectively, which were offset by a $166 million loss, a $68 million loss and a $175 million loss, respectively, from the change in fair value of the CLO borrowings.
The net gains (losses) were recorded in net gain (loss) on consolidated VIEs on the consolidated statements of income.
The change in fair value of the assets and liabilities included interest income and expense, respectively.
6. Variable Interest Entities In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles, including CDOs/CLOs and sponsored investment funds, which may be considered VIEs. The Company receives advisory fees and/or other incentive-related fees for its services and may from time to time own equity or debt securities or enter into derivatives with the vehicles, each of which are considered variable interests. The Company enters into these variable interests principally to address client needs through the launch of such investment vehicles. The VIEs are primarily financed via capital contributed by equity and debt holders. The Companys involvement in financing the operations of the VIEs is generally limited to its equity interests.
In order to determine whether the Company is the PB of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of projected future cash flows of the VIEs. Assumptions made in such analyses may include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, pre-payments, realization of gains, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. See Note 2 for more information.
F-34 Table of Contents 6. Variable Interest Entities (continued) Consolidated VIEs . Consolidated VIEs included CLOs in which BlackRock did not have an investment; however, BlackRock, as the collateral manager, was deemed to have both the power to control the activities of the CLOs and the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the CLOs. In addition, BlackRock was the PB of one investment fund, which absorbed the majority of the variability due to its de-facto third-party relationships with other partners in the fund. The assets of these VIEs are not available to creditors of the Company. In addition, the investors in these VIEs have no recourse to the credit of the Company. At December31, 2012 and 2011, the following balances related to VIEs were consolidated on the consolidated statements of financial condition: (Dollar amounts in millions) December31, 2012 December31, 2011 Assets of consolidated VIEs: Cash and cash equivalents $ 297 $ 54 Bank loans 2,110 1,459 Bonds 124 145 Other investments 30 35 Total bank loans, bonds and other investments 2,264 1,639 Liabilities of consolidated VIEs: Borrowings (2,402 ) (1,574 ) Other liabilities (103 ) (9 ) Appropriated retained earnings (29 ) (72 ) Non-controlling interests of consolidated VIEs (27 ) (38 ) Total BlackRock net interests in consolidated VIEs $  $  During 2012, the Company recorded a $38 million non-operating loss offset by a $38 million net loss attributable to nonredeemable non-controlling interests on the consolidated statements of income. During 2011, the Company recorded an $18 million non-operating loss offset by an $18 million net loss attributable to nonredeemable non-controlling interests on the consolidated statements of income. During 2010, the Company recorded a $35 million non-operating loss offset by a $35 million net loss attributable to nonredeemable non-controlling interests on the consolidated statements of income.
At December31, 2012 and 2011, the weighted-average maturity of the bank loans and bonds was approximately 4.5 years and 4.2 years, respectively.
F-35 Table of Contents 6. Variable Interest Entities (continued) Non-Consolidated VIEs.
At December31, 2012 and 2011, the Companys carrying value of assets and liabilities and its maximum risk of loss related to VIEs for which it is the sponsor or in which it holds a variable interest but for which it was not the PB, were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) At December31, 2012 Variable Interests on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition Investments Advisory Fee Receivables Other Net Assets (Liabilities) Maximum Riskof Loss (1) CDOs/CLOs $ 1 $ 1 $ (5 ) $ 19 Other sponsored investment funds: Collective trusts  248  248 Other 17 61 (3 ) 77 Total $ 18 $ 310 $ (8 ) $ 344 At December31, 2011 CDOs/CLOs $ 1 $ 2 $ (3 ) $ 20 Other sponsored investment funds: Collective trusts  184  184 Other 18 54 (5 ) 72 Total $ 19 $ 240 $ (8 ) $ 276 (1) At both December31, 2012 and December31, 2011, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss associated with these VIEs primarily related to: (i)advisory fee receivables; (ii)BlackRocks investments; and (iii)$17 million of credit protection sold by BlackRock to a third party in a synthetic CDO transaction.
The net assets related to the above CDOs/CLOs and other sponsored investment funds, including collective trusts, that the Company does not consolidate were as follows: CDOs/CLOs (Dollar amounts in billions) December31, 2012 December31, 2011 Assets at fair value $ 4 $ 5 Liabilities (1) 5 7 Net assets $ (1 ) $ (2 ) (1) Amounts primarily comprised of unpaid principal debt obligations to CDO/CLO debt holders.
Other sponsored investments funds.
Net assets of other sponsored investment funds that are non-consolidated VIEs approximated $1.5 trillion to $1.6 trillion at December31, 2012 and $1.2 trillion to $1.3 trillion at December31, 2011. Net assets included $1.3 trillion and $1.0 trillion of collective trusts at December31, 2012 and December31, 2011, respectively. Each collective trust has been aggregated separately and may include collective trusts that invest in other collective trusts. The net assets of these VIEs primarily are comprised of cash and cash equivalents and investments offset by liabilities primarily comprised of various accruals for the sponsored investment vehicles.
7. Derivatives and Hedging In May 2011, the Company entered into a designated cash flow hedge consisting of a $750 million interest rate swap maturing in 2013 to hedge future cash flows on the Companys floating rate notes due in 2013. Interest on this swap is at a fixed rate of 1.03% payable semi-annually on May24 and November24 of each year and commenced November24, 2011. See Note 11, Borrowings, for more information. The fair value of the interest rate swap as of December31, 2012 and 2011 was not material.
The Company maintains a program to enter into total return swaps to hedge against market price exposures with respect to certain seed investments in sponsored investment products. At December31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had 21 and six outstanding total return swaps, respectively, with an aggregate notional value of approximately $206 million and $43 million, respectively. The fair value of the outstanding total return swaps as of December31, 2012 and 2011 was not material.
Market risk from forward foreign currency exchange contracts is the effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in currency exchange rates.

At December31, 2011, the Company did not have any outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The Company entered into a credit default swap, providing credit protection to the counterparty of approximately $17 million, representing the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection.The Company carries the credit default swap at fair value based on the expected future cash flows under the arrangement.
On behalf of clients of the Companys registered life insurance company, which maintains separate accounts representing segregated funds held for the purpose of funding individual and group pension contracts, the Company invests in various derivative instruments, which may include futures, forward foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and inflation rate swaps. Net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to derivatives held by separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owners and are not reported in the consolidated statements of income.
The following table presents the carrying value as of December31, 2012 and 2011 of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments: December31, 2012 December31, 2011 (Dollar amounts in millions) Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Credit default swap Other liabilities $  $ 5 $  $ 3 Separate account derivatives Separate account assets 95  1,495  Separate account liabilities  95  1,495 Total $ 95 $ 100 $ 1,495 $ 1,498 The fair value of the derivatives held by separate account assets is equal and offset by a separate account liability.
Gains (losses) on total return swaps are recorded in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income and were $(23) million, $4 million and $(2) million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Gains (losses) on the interest rate swap entered into in 2011 were not material for 2012 and 2011.

(1) 106  Swiss Re Private Equity Partners (2) 25  Goodwill adjustments related to Quellos (3) (13 ) (13 ) End of year balance $ 12,910 $ 12,792 (1) Amount represents goodwill resulting from the Companys acquisition of the Canadian exchange-traded products (ETP) provider, Claymore Investments, Inc. (the Claymore Transaction) on March7, 2012 for approximately $212 million.
(2) Amount represents goodwill resulting from the Companys acquisition of the European private equity and infrastructure funds of funds of Swiss Re Private Equity Partners (the SRPEP Transaction) on September4, 2012.
(3) The decrease in goodwill during 2012 and 2011 primarily resulted from a decline related to tax benefits realized from tax-deductible goodwill in excess of book goodwill from the acquisition of the fund-of-funds business of Quellos Group, LLC (the Quellos Transaction). Goodwill related to the Quellos Transaction will continue to be reduced in future periods by the amount of tax benefits realized from tax-deductible goodwill in excess of book goodwill from the Quellos Transaction. The balance of the Quellos tax-deductible goodwill in excess of book goodwill was approximately $324 million and $355 million as of December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In 2012, the decrease in Quellos goodwill was partially offset by a $10 million increase related to the release of the remaining common shares held in escrow in connection with the Quellos Transaction.
The impairment tests performed for goodwill as of July31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 indicated that no impairment charges were required.

F-39 Table of Contents 11. Borrowings Short-Term Borrowings The carrying value of short-term borrowings at December31, 2012 and 2011, included $100 million under the 2012 revolving credit facility and $100 million under the 2011 revolving credit facility, respectively.
2012 Revolving Credit Facility . In March 2011, the Company entered into a five-year $3.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2011 credit facility). In March 2012, the 2011 credit facility was amended to extend the maturity date by one year to March 2017 and in April 2012 the amount of the aggregate commitment was increased to $3.785 billion (the 2012 credit facility). The 2012 credit facility permits the Company to request an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2012 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $4.785 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread.

Investment Commitments .
At December31, 2012, the Company had $235 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds, including funds of private equity funds, real estate funds and distressed credit funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party non-controlling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company, but which are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
Contingencies Contingent Payments.
The Company acts as the portfolio manager in a series of credit default swap transactions and has a maximum potential exposure of $17 million under a credit default swap between the Company and counterparty. See Note 7, Derivatives and Hedging, for further discussion of this transaction and the related commitment.
Legal Proceedings.
From time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various U.S. federal, state governmental and domestic and international regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide or other investigations or proceedings. It is BlackRocks policy to cooperate fully with such inquiries. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRocks activities. Additionally, certain of the investment funds that the Company manages are subject to lawsuits, any of which potentially could harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the Company being liable to the funds for any resulting damages.
Management, after consultation with legal counsel, currently does not anticipate that the aggregate liability, if any, arising out of regulatory matters or lawsuits will have a material effect on BlackRocks results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, there is no assurance as to whether any such pending or threatened matters will have a material effect on BlackRocks results of operations, financial position or cash flows in any future reporting period. Due to uncertaintiessurrounding the outcome of these matters, management cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of lossthat may arise from these matters.
Indemnifications.
In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts pursuant to which it may agree to indemnify third parties in certain circumstances. The terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined.
In connection with securities lending transactions, BlackRock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrowers failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrowers obligation under the securities lending agreement.As part of the BGI F-42 Table of Contents 12. Commitments and Contingencies (continued) acquisition, Barclays was contractually obligated to continue providing counterparty default indemnification to several BlackRock securities lending clients through December1,2012. BlackRock assumed these indemnification obligations prior to or upon the expiration of Barclays indemnification obligation.As of December31, 2012, the Company indemnified certain of its clients for loan balances of approximately $99.5 billion. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material to the consolidated statements of financial condition as of December31, 2012. The Company expects indemnified balances to continue to increase over time.
Under the transaction agreement in the BGI Transaction, the Company agreed to indemnify Barclays for losses it may incur arising from (1)breach by the Company of certain representations, (2)breach by the Company of any covenant in the agreement, (3)liabilities of the entities acquired in the transaction other than liabilities assumed by Barclays or for which it is providing indemnification, and (4)certain taxes.
Management believes that the likelihood of any liability arising under the BGI Transaction indemnification provisions is remote.Management cannot estimate any potential maximum exposuredue both to the remoteness of any potential claims and the fact that items that wouldbe included within any such calculatedclaim would be beyond the control of BlackRock. Consequently, no liability has been recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition.

Market Performance-based RSUs.
Pursuant to the Award Plan, market performance-based RSUs may be granted to certain employees. The market performance-based RSUs require that separate 15%, 25% and 35% share price appreciation targets be achieved during the six-year term of the awards. The awards are split into three tranches and each tranche may vest if the specified target increase in share price is met. Eligible delivery dates for each tranche are the fourth, fifth or sixth anniversaries of the grant date and the awards are generally forfeited if the employee leaves BlackRock before the vesting date. These awards are amortized over a service period of four years, which is the longer of the explicit service period or the period in which the market target is expected to be met. Market performance-based RSUs are not considered participating securities as the dividend equivalents are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting of the award. In 2012, the Company granted 616,117 market performance-based RSUs, which will primarily be funded by shares currently held by PNC (see Long-Term Incentive Plans Funded by PNC below).

The fair value of the market-performance-based awards at the grant date was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation and the following assumptions: Grant Year Risk-Free Interest Rate Performance Period Expected Stock Volatility Expected Dividend Yield 2012 1.21% 6 33.63% 2.99% F-44 Table of Contents 13. Stock-Based Compensation (continued) The Companys expected stock volatility assumption was based upon an average of the historical stock price fluctuations of BlackRocks common stock and an implied volatility at the grant date. The dividend yield assumption was derived using estimated dividends over the expected term and the stock price at the date of grant. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield at date of grant.
In January 2013, the Company granted 556,581 market performance-based RSUs under the Award Plan, which will primarily be funded by shares currently held by PNC (see Long-Term Incentive Plans Funded by PNC below).
Long-Term Incentive Plans Funded by PNC.

Rabbi Trust.
The rabbi trust established for the VDCP, with assets totaling $59 million as of both December31, 2012 and 2011, is reflected in investments on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Such investments are classified as trading and other investments. The corresponding liability balance of $60 million and $59 million as of December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, is reflected on the consolidated statements of financial condition as accrued compensation and benefits. Earnings in the rabbi trust, including unrealized appreciation or depreciation, are reflected as non-operating income (expense) and changes in the corresponding liability are reflected as employee compensation and benefits expense on the consolidated statements of income.
Other Deferred Compensation Plans.
The Company has additional compensation plans for the purpose of F-45 Table of Contents 14. Employee Benefit Plans (continued) providing deferred compensation and retention incentives to certain employees.

BlackRock Group Personal Pension Plan.
BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Limited (BIM), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, contributes to the BlackRock Group Personal Pension Plan, a defined contribution plan for all employees of BIM. BIM contributes between 6% and 15% of each employees eligible compensation. The expense for this plan was $27 million, $26 million and $22 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Defined Benefit Plans.
The Company has several defined benefit pension plans in Japan and Germany. All accrued benefits under these defined benefit plans are currently frozen and the plans are closed to new participants. The participant benefits under the plans will not change with salary increases or additional years of service.
In conjunction with the BGI Transaction, the Company assumed defined benefit pension plans in Japan and Germany, which are closed to new participants. During 2010, these plans merged into the legacy BlackRock plans in Japan (the Japan Plan) and Germany. At December31, 2012 and 2011, the plan assets for these plans were approximately $21 million for both periods and the unfunded obligations were less than $3 million for both periods, which were recorded in accrued compensation and benefits on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Benefit payments for the next five years and in aggregate for the five years thereafter are not expected to be material.
Defined benefit plan assets for the Japan Plan of approximately $18 million are invested using a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equity securities, debt securities and other investments are used to preserve asset values, diversify risk and achieve the target investment return benchmark. Investment strategies and asset allocations are based on consideration of plan liabilities and the funded status of the plan. Investment performance and asset allocation are measured and monitored on an ongoing basis. The current target allocations for the plan assets are 45-50% for U.S. and international equity securities, 50-55% for U.S. and international fixed income securities and 0-5% for cash and cash equivalents.

For 2012, 2011 and 2010, expenses for these benefits were not material.
15. Related Party Transactions Determination of Related Parties PNC.
The Company considers PNC, along with its affiliates, to be related parties based on the level of its ownership of BlackRock capital stock. At December31, 2012, PNC owned approximately 20.8% of the Companys voting common stock and held approximately 21.9% of the total capital stock.

The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities are shown below: December31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2012 2011 Deferred income tax assets: Compensation and benefits $ 355 $ 304 Unrealized investment losses 71 110 Loss carryforwards 81 87 Other 222 229 Gross deferred tax assets 729 730 Less: deferred tax valuation allowances (95 ) (95 ) Deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances 634 635 Deferred income tax liabilities: Goodwill and acquired indefinite-lived intangibles 5,656 5,675 Acquired finite-lived intangibles 158 208 Other 109 69 Gross deferred tax liabilities 5,923 5,952 Net deferred tax (liabilities) $ (5,289 ) $ (5,317 ) Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded net when related to the same tax jurisdiction. At December31, 2012, the Company recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition deferred income tax assets, within other assets, and deferred income tax liabilities of $4 million and $5,293 million, respectively. At December31, 2011, the Company recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition deferred income tax assets, within other assets, and deferred income tax liabilities of $6 million and $5,323 million, respectively.
During 2012, tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the Companys organizational structure primarily resulted in a $50 million net non-cash benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities.
In 2011, an enacted state tax law and a state tax election went into effect, which resulted in a revaluation of certain net deferred income tax liabilities primarily related to acquired intangible assets, which resulted in a $52 million and $91 million tax benefit, respectively. In addition, the United Kingdom and Japan enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates, which resulted in a revaluation of certain net deferred income tax liabilities primarily related to acquired intangible assets, which resulted in a $60million and $13 million tax benefit, respectively.
The Company had a deferred income tax asset related to unrealized investment losses of approximately $71 million and $110 million as of December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, reflecting the Companys conclusion that based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. Realized capital losses may be carried back three years and carried forward five years and offset against realized capital gains for federal income tax purposes. The Company expects to hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and to generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses.
At December31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had available state net operating loss carryforwards of $842 million and $388 million, respectively, which will expire on or before 2032.

At December31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had $95 million and $95 million of valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets, respectively, recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The year-over-year increase in the valuation allowance primarily related to certain foreign deferred income tax assets.
Goodwill recorded in connection with the Quellos Transaction has been reduced during the period by the amount of tax benefit realized from tax-deductible goodwill. See Note 9, Goodwill, for further discussion.
Current income taxes are recorded net in the consolidated statements of financial condition when related to the same tax jurisdiction. As of December31, 2012, the Company had current income taxes receivable and payable of $102 million and $121 million, respectively, recorded in other assets and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, respectively. As of December31, 2011, the Company had current income taxes receivable and payable of $108 million and $102 million, respectively, recorded in other assets and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, respectively.

The excess totaled $2,125 million and $1,516 million as of December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The determination of the additional deferred income taxes on the excess has not been provided because it is not practicable due to the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.
The following tabular reconciliation presents the total amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits: Year ended December31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Balance at January1 $ 349 $ 307 $ 285 Additions for tax positions of prior years 4 22 10 Reductions for tax positions of prior years (1 ) (1 ) (17 ) Additions based on tax positions related to current year 69 46 35 Lapse of statute of limitations   (8 ) Settlements (29 ) (25 ) (2 ) Positions assumed in acquisitions 12  4 Balance at December31 $ 404 $ 349 $ 307 Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are $250 million, $226 million and $194 million of tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.

The Company accrued interest and penalties of $10 million during 2011 and in total, as of December31, 2011, had recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $66 million. The Company accrued interest and penalties of $8 million during 2010 and in total, as of December31, 2010, had recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $56 million. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company has been indemnified by Barclays for $73 million and Guggenheim for $6 million of unrecognized tax benefits.
BlackRock is subject to U.S. federal income tax, state and local income tax, and foreign income tax in multiple jurisdictions. Tax years after 2007 remain open to U.S. federal income tax examination, tax years after 2005 remain open to state and local income tax examination, and tax years after 2006 remain open to income tax examination in the United Kingdom. With few exceptions, as of December31, 2012, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before 2006.
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its examination of BlackRocks 2006 and 2007 tax years in March 2011. In November 2011, the IRS commenced its examination of BlackRocks 2008 and 2009 tax years, and while the impact on the consolidated financial statements is undetermined, it is not expected to be material.
In July 2011, the IRS commenced its federal income tax audit of the BGI group, which BlackRock acquired in December 2009. The tax years under examination are 2007 through December1, 2009, and while the impact on the consolidated financial statements is undetermined, it is not expected to be material.
The Company is currently under audit in several state and local jurisdictions. The significant state and local income tax examinations are in California for tax years 2004 through 2006, New York City for tax years 2007 through 2008, and New Jersey for tax years 2003 through 2009. No state and local income tax audits cover years earlier than 2007 except for California, New Jersey and New York City. No state and local income tax audits are expected to result in an assessment material to the consolidated financial statements.
F-55 Table of Contents 19. Income Taxes (continued) In December 2009, Her Majestys Revenue and Customs (HMRC) commenced its United Kingdom income tax audit of BlackRocks 2007 through 2010 tax years. While the impact on the consolidated financial statements is undetermined, it is not expected to be material.
As of December31, 2012, it is reasonably possible the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease within the next twelve months due to completion of tax authorities exams or the expiration of statues of limitations. Management estimates that the existing liability for uncertain tax positions could decrease by approximately $5 million to $15 million within the next twelve months. The Company does not anticipate that any possible adjustments resulting from these audits would result in a material change to its consolidated financial statements.
20. Earnings Per Share The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS): (Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data) 2012 2011 2010 Basic EPS: Net income attributable to BlackRock $ 2,458 $ 2,337 $ 2,063 Less: Dividends distributed to common shares 1,059 1,004 764 Dividends distributed to participating RSUs 1 10 12 Undistributed net income attributable to BlackRock.
1,398 1,323 1,287 Percentage of undistributed net income allocated to common shares (a) 99.9 % 99.1 % 98.6 % Undistributed net income allocated to common shares 1,396 1,311 1,269 Plus: Common share dividends 1,059 1,004 764 Net income attributable to common shares $ 2,455 $ 2,315 $ 2,033 Weighted-average shares outstanding 174,961,018 184,265,367 190,554,510 Earnings per basic share attributable to BlackRock common stockholders $ 14.03 $ 12.56 $ 10.67 Diluted EPS: Net income attributable to common shares $ 2,455 $ 2,315 $ 2,033 Weighted-average shares outstanding 174,961,018 184,265,367 190,554,510 Dilutive effect of: Non-participating RSUs 2,810,312 2,139,100 1,008,682 Stock options 246,349 687,192 742,805 Convertible debt  24,751 386,050 Total diluted weighted-average shares outstanding 178,017,679 187,116,410 192,692,047 Earnings per dilutive share attributable to BlackRock common stockholders $ 13.79 $ 12.37 $ 10.55 (a) Allocation to common stockholders is based on the total of common and participating security stockholders (which represent unvested RSUs that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends). For 2012, 2011 and 2010, average outstanding participating securities were 0.2million, 1.8million and 2.8million, respectively.
Due to the similarities in terms between BlackRock non-voting participating preferred stock and the Companys common stock, the Company considers participating preferred stock to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of EPS calculations. As such, the Company has included the outstanding non-voting participating preferred stock in the calculation of average basic and diluted shares outstanding.
For 2012, 2011 and 2010, 449, 5,125 and 1,198,856 RSUs, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because to include them would have an anti-dilutive effect. In addition, there were no anti-dilutive stock options for 2012, 2011 and 2010.
