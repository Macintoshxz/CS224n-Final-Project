On December1, 2009, BlackRock acquired Barclays Global Investors (BGI) from Barclays Bank PLC (Barclays), referred to as the BGI Transaction, adding substantial investment and risk management capabilities and more than 3,500 new colleagues to the combined organization.

Upon closing of the BGI Transaction, we commenced operations as a unified firm with the integration of corporate systems largely completed and implementation of our operating platform well underway. Substantial operating and cultural integration work is expected to continue over the course of the next two years.
BlackRock is an independent, publicly traded company, with no single majority stockholder and a majority of independent directors. At December31, 2009, Merrill Lynch& Co., Inc.

BUSINESS Overview (continued) On a pro forma combined basis (as though the BGI Transaction had closed on December31, 2008), AUM increased 23% or $634.5 billion from $2.712 trillion at year-end 2008. Net new business during the year totaled $159.8 billion, including $219.2 billion of net inflows in long-dated and advisory AUM and $59.4 billion of outflows in cash management products. In addition, a strong recovery in global credit and equity markets and favorable foreign exchange rate movements contributed $472.3 billion to AUM growth in 2009. At year-end, 85% of AUM was in long-dated strategies (46% in equities, 32% in fixed income, 4% in multi-asset class and 3% in alternative investments), 10% was in cash management products and 5% was in advisory or long-term liquidation portfolios. BlackRock has realized a 58% compound annual growth rate in AUM over the past five years through a combination of acquisitions, new business, investment performance, market appreciation and foreign exchange movements.

BUSINESS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock operates in a global marketplace characterized by a high degree of market volatility and economic uncertainty, factors that can significantly affect earnings and stockholder returns in any given period. Management seeks to achieve attractive returns for stockholders over time by, among other things, capitalizing on the following factors:  The Companys diversified product offerings, which enhance its ability to offer a variety of traditional and alternative investment products across the risk spectrum and to tailor single- and multi- asset class investment solutions to address specific client needs;  the Companys longstanding commitment to risk management and the continued development of, and increased interest in, BlackRock Solutions products and services;  the Companys global presence, with approximately 40% of employees outside the United States supporting local investment capabilities and serving clients of which approximately 39% of total AUM was managed for clients domiciled outside the United States and Canada; and  the growing recognition of the BlackRock brand, the strength of the Companys culture and the depth and breadth of its intellectual capital.
The Companys ability to increase revenue, earnings and stockholder value over time is predicated on its ability to generate new business in investment management and BlackRock Solutions products and services. New business efforts are dependent on BlackRocks ability to achieve clients investment objectives in a manner consistent with their risk preferences and to deliver excellent client service. All of these efforts require the commitment and contributions of BlackRock employees. Accordingly, the ability to attract and retain talented professionals is critical to the Companys long-term success.

See additional information in Item6, Selected Financial Data.
BlackRock reports its financial results using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP); however, management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain prior year non-GAAP data has been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
5 Table of Contents Item1.
BUSINESS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating Income, as Adjusted: GAAP reported operating income includes certain significant items, the after-tax impact of which management considers non-recurring or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value and, therefore, are excluded in calculating operating income, as adjusted.
Operating income, as adjusted (a non-GAAP measure), excludes certain expenses incurred related to the integration of the SSR, MLIM, Quellos and BGI Transactions in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009, respectively, transaction costs, which include advisory fees, legal fees and consulting expenses related to the BGI Transaction, a 2007 termination fee for closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, 2008 and 2009 restructuring charges and compensation expense associated with appreciation / (depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans. These expenses have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, because they have been deemed non-recurring by management and to help enhance the comparability of this information to prior periods.
The portion of compensation expense associated with certain of BlackRocks long-term incentive plan (LTIP) awards that will be funded through distributions to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and a Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution, a portion of which has been received, have been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of LTIP participants put options, primarily in the three months ended March31, 2007, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. A detailed discussion of the LTIP is included in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form10-K.
Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non-operating income (expense).
Management believes that operating income exclusive of these costs is more representative of the operating performance for the respective periods.
Operating Margin, as Adjusted: Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Companys results until future periods.
Operating margin, as adjusted, allows the Company to compare performance from period-to-period by adjusting for items that may not recur, recur infrequently or may fluctuate based on market movements, such as restructuring charges, transaction/integration costs, closed-end fund launch costs and fluctuations in deferred compensation expense based on mark-to-market movements in investments held to fund certain compensation plans. The Company also uses operating margin, as adjusted, to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance to other companies. Management reviews both the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
6 Table of Contents Item1.
BUSINESS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating Margin, as Adjusted (continued): Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and to other third parties. Management believes that excluding such costs is useful to BlackRock because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. Reimbursable property management compensation represented compensation and benefits paid to personnel of Metric Property Management, Inc. (Metric), a subsidiary of BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (Realty). Prior to the transfer in 2008 to a third party, these employees were retained on Metrics payroll when certain properties were acquired by Realtys clients. The related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by Realtys clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they did not bear an economic cost to BlackRock. For each of these items, BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues.
Non-Operating Income (Expense), Less Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Non-controlling Interests, as Adjusted: Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted, equals non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis, less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, GAAP basis, adjusted for compensation expense associated with depreciation or appreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans. The compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis.
Management believes that non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted, provides for comparability of this information to prior periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRocks non-operating contribution to its consolidated results. As compensation expense associated with depreciation or appreciation on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, offsets the gain/(loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes that non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks non-operating results that impact book value.
Net Income Attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as Adjusted: GAAP reported net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc. and GAAP diluted earnings per common share include certain significant items, the after-tax impact of which management considers non-recurring or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value and, therefore, are excluded in calculating net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted.
Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted (non-GAAP measures), exclude the after-tax impact of the 2008 and 2009 restructuring charges, the 2007 termination of closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, LTIP expense to be funded by PNC and by a Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution, a portion of which has been received, the SSR, MLIM, Quellos and BGI integration costs, BGI transaction costs and the effect on deferred income tax expense attributable to changes in corporate income tax rates as a result of enacted legislation.

Products * BlackRock offers a broad spectrum of investment management and risk management products and services. Investment management offerings include single- and multi-asset class portfolios, which may be structured to focus on a particular investment style, capitalization range, region or market sector; credit or maturity profile; or liability structure. Revenue from these products primarily consists of advisory fees, typically structured as a percentage of AUM. In some instances, we earn securities lending fees or performance fees, which may be expressed as a share of earnings or a percentage of returns in excess of agreed-upon targets. In addition, BlackRock offers its Aladdin  investment system, as well as risk management, outsourcing and advisory services, to institutional investors under the BlackRock Solutions name. Revenue on these services may be based on several criteria including asset volume, number of users, accomplishment of specific deliverables or other performance objectives.
Equity BlackRocks equity AUM closed the year at $1.536 trillion, up 656%, or $1.333 trillion, from reported AUM of $203.3 billion at December31, 2008. The increase was due primarily to the BGI Transaction, which contributed $1.188 trillion in acquired assets. On a pro forma combined basis, equity AUM increased 47% or $488.2 billion from $1.048 trillion at year-end 2008. The pro forma increase included $124.2 billion in net new business and $360.2 billion from investment performance (alpha) and positive market movement (beta).

BlackRock manages equity portfolios utilizing three distinct investment approaches: index or passive, active fundamental and active scientific. Index strategies employ a structured balance of risk, return and cost to offer an efficient way to obtain exposure to equity markets. Fundamental investments seek to add value relative to a specified index or on an absolute basis primarily through security selection based on BlackRocks proprietary research and portfolio manager judgment. Scientific equity strategies seek superior investment outcomes through a stock selection process that aims to systematically find and exploit pricing opportunities while rigorously managing risk and cost. A wide variety of products are offered in each of these styles, including global and regional portfolios; value, growth and core products; large, mid and small cap strategies; and selected sector funds.
* See Product Performance Notes below.

BUSINESS (continued) Products (continued) Equity (continued) At year-end 2009, index strategies represented $1.183 trillion, or 77%, of equity AUM. Active equity portfolios totaled $353.1 billion, or 23%, of equity AUM, including $208.7 billion in active fundamental strategies and $144.3 billion in active scientific products. During the year, investors reallocated from cash earning near zero to higher risk assets, helping to fuel a strong recovery in the global equity markets. Index strategies, including ETFs, attracted significant flows as an efficient means of gaining market exposure, in some cases pending longer-term allocations to active strategies. On a pro forma combined basis, BlackRock had net new business of $146.8 billion in index funds and $10.4 billion in active fundamental portfolios, which more than offset $33.0 billion of net outflows in active scientific equities.
BlackRock manages equity portfolios for a diverse base of institutional and retail clients globally. At December31, 2009, 65% of equity AUM or $1.001 trillion was managed on behalf of institutional investors in separate accounts, collective investment trusts and mutual funds. An additional $381.4 billion or 25% of equity AUM were managed in iShares products, which are purchased by both institutional and retail investors on stock exchanges worldwide. The remaining 10%, or $153.9 billion, of equity AUM was managed for retail and high net worth investors, largely through open-end mutual funds and separately managed accounts. Approximately 59%, or $912.2 billion, of our equity AUM was managed for clients based in the United States and Canada. The remaining 41% or $623.9 billion of equity AUM included $444.5 billion managed for clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), $167.8 billion in Asia Pacific and $11.5 billion for investors in Latin America and Iberia. Net inflows of $124.2 billion were positive across all regions, with $56.9 billion of net new business from the United States and Canada, $46.3 billion from EMEA, $18.8 billion from Asia Pacific and $2.1 billion from Latin America and Iberia.
Global equity markets were volatile throughout 2009, reaching their two-year lows in March and rebounding sharply thereafter. For example, the MSCI World Index declined to a low of 172.7 in March before rebounding to 299.4 at year-end, a 73% increase from its nadir and a 32% overall return for the full year. BlackRocks index equity accounts closely tracked their corresponding benchmarks, with 68% of AUM achieving returns within 1% of index returns and 56% of AUM outperforming their benchmarks. Our active fundamental equity strategies maintained strong long-term track records, with 59%, 76% and 86% of active fundamental AUM above their benchmarks (which for certain non-U.S. products are based upon peer medians), while 10%, 19% and 24% of active scientific AUM outperformed their benchmarks (which for certain non-U.S. products are based upon peer medians) for the one-, three- and five-year periods ended December31, 2009, respectively. Although active scientific equity strategies have struggled industry-wide since mid-2007, we believe in the long-term viability of the approach and have committed substantial resources to research and development of the next generation of active scientific equity investing.

BUSINESS (continued) Products (continued) Fixed Income BlackRocks fixed income AUM ended 2009 at $1.056 trillion, representing an increase of $574.2 billion or 119%, over the previous years reported results. The BGI Transaction added $517.3 billion of AUM. On a pro forma combined basis, fixed income AUM rose 18%, or $161.0 billion. During the year, we were awarded net new business of $77.1 billion, driving 48% of the years increase in AUM. Investment performance and market appreciation contributed $80.3 billion, or 50%, of the combined growth.

BlackRock offers a broad range of index and actively managed fixed income products across regions, sectors, credit quality and maturities. Actively managed strategies may employ a fundamental or model-driven investment process. The former emphasizes risk-controlled sector rotation and security selection driven by sector experts and direct interaction with issuers and market makers, while the latter employs models to identify relative return opportunities and to apply those results, subject to a pragmatic review of model risk, on a systematic basis across portfolios. Fixed income mandates are often tailored to client-specified liabilities, accounting, regulatory or rating agency requirements, or other investment policies. Year-end fixed income AUM consisted of $459.3 billion, or 44%, in index portfolios and $596.3 billion in active strategies. Investors returned to the bond markets in 2009, driving a substantial tightening in credit spreads from the historically high levels reached during 2008. Demand for fixed income offerings was strong across products, with $62.8 billion of net new business in index products, including iShares , and $14.2 billion in active strategies. Key areas of growth included non-dollar denominated products, such as liability driven investment solutions in the U.K., and U.S. core strategies, with $38.2 billion and $15.8 billion of net inflows, respectively, throughout the year.
Of BlackRocks total fixed income AUM, 81%, or $860.0 billion, was managed on behalf of institutional investors, 10% or $102.5 billion of AUM was managed in iShares products, including 22 new offerings launched during 2009, and 9% or $93.2 billion was managed for retail and high net worth investors. The client base was well diversified geographically, with 54% or $572.2 billion of fixed income AUM managed for clients based in the United States and Canada. The remaining 46% or $483.4 billion of fixed income AUM included $332.4 billion managed for clients in EMEA, $143.0 billion in Asia Pacific and $8.0 billion for investors in Latin America and Iberia. Net inflows of $38.9 billion and $45.7 billion from U.S and Canadian and EMEA clients, respectively, more than offset cumulative net outflows of $7.6 billion from clients in Asia Pacific and Latin America and Iberia.
A significant rally in credit spreads drove strong performance in the bond markets, with the Barclays Global Aggregate Index posting a 6.9% return for the year. BlackRocks fixed income index accounts closely tracked their benchmarks, with 77% of accounts achieving returns within 1% of index returns and 53% of AUM outperforming their benchmarks. Our active fixed income strategies achieved strong performance in 2009, with 79%, 33% and 40% of active fundamental AUM above their benchmarks (which for certain non-U.S. products are based upon peer medians) and 71%, 70% and 89% of active model-based AUM above their benchmarks (which for certain non-U.S. products are based upon peer medians) for the one-, three- and five-year periods ended December31, 2009, respectively.

BUSINESS (continued) Products (continued) Multi-Asset Class In view of the growing demand for investment solutions that utilize a combination of fixed income, equities and alternative investments, BlackRock is recognizing multi-asset class as a separate product category. Strategies include asset allocation and balanced mandates, target date and target risk funds, and fiduciary outsourcing relationships. BlackRocks multi-asset class AUM closed the year at $142.0 billion, an increase of 83%, or $64.5 billion, from the $77.5 billion multi-asset class AUM that was reported as part of equity and balanced AUM at December31, 2008. The LifePath  portfolios, the industrys first target date funds, represented over half of the acquired AUM. On a pro forma combined basis, multi-asset class AUM rose 33% or $35.4 billion, including $13.5 billion of net new business, largely driven by retail investors into mutual funds. The multi-asset class products were further spurred by the recovery in global financial markets as positive market movements added another $21.5 billion throughout the year.

Asset allocation and balanced mandates represented $86.7 billion, or 61%, of total multi-asset class AUM at December31, 2009. These products have been in strong demand by retail investors globally seeking comprehensive investment solutions. Target date and target risk funds, including the LifePath portfolios and our newer SponsorMatch  offerings, totaled $28.8 billion or 20% of multi-asset class AUM. These retirement savings products, which are Qualified Default Investment Options under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, utilize a proprietary asset allocation model that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investors targeted retirement timing. Fiduciary outsourcing mandates, in which a pension plan sponsor retains BlackRock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of plan management, represented $24.4 billion, or 17%, of multi-asset class AUM. The remaining $2.0 billion, or 2%, of multi-asset class AUM was managed in various global derivatives, diversified growth and relative return strategies.
BlackRocks multi-asset class products were managed on behalf of a well-balanced client base. At December31, 2009, institutional investors represented 54%, or $76.7 billion, of multi-asset class AUM, while retail and high net worth investors accounted for 46% or $65.2 billion. The remaining $0.2 billion were managed in iShares offerings. The geographic mix was similarly diversified, with 53% or $75.8 billion of AUM managed for clients based in the United States and Canada, and 47% or $66.2 billion managed for international investors, principally in EMEA. During the year, clients in the United States and Canada, EMEA and Latin America and Iberia awarded BlackRock net new business of $15.0 billion, which offset net outflows of $1.5 billion from clients in Asia Pacific.
Approximately 18% of BlackRocks multi-asset class AUM is managed in portfolios that are customized to unique client requirements. The remaining strategies have achieved competitive performance, with 69% of AUM over their benchmarks for the one year, 73% for the three years and 86% for the five years ended December31, 2009.

BUSINESS (continued) Products (continued) Alternative Investments BlackRock ended 2009 with $102.1 billion of AUM in its alternative investment products, a 66%, or $40.6 billion, increase as compared to reported AUM at year-end 2008. The BGI Transaction added $49.4 billion of AUM in a variety of currency, commodity, global macro and hedge fund offerings. These products complement BlackRocks fund of funds, real estate, hedge fund and opportunistic strategies. Alternative AUM was adversely affected by net outflows, disbursements from opportunistic funds and declining real estate markets in 2009. In particular, while many alternative managers suspended redemptions in 2008, we were able to avoid such drastic action throughout the financial crisis. Although this policy may have amplified redemptions in our hedge funds and funds of hedge funds, we believe our focus on putting clients needs first will be rewarded over time.

BlackRocks alternative investment products include real estate debt and equity; funds of funds; macro funds, hedge funds and other absolute return strategies; and active currency and commodity funds, as described below. The alternative investment clientele was predominantly institutional, representing 81% or $83.1 billion of alternatives AUM.
iShares contributed another 10%, or $10.1 billion, of AUM, and retail and high net worth investors comprised the remaining 9% or $8.9 billion of ending assets. The geographic mix was diversified, with 59% or $60.7 billion of AUM managed for clients in the United States and Canada, 23% or $23.7 billion for clients in EMEA, 17% or $17.6 billion for clients in Asia Pacific, and 1% or $62.4 million for clients in Latin America and Iberia. Many of our alternative investment products had strong investment performance in 2009, and a number reached or surpassed their high water marks by year-end.
Real Estate: At year-end 2009, BlackRock managed $18.1 billion in a variety of real estate debt and equity products. Offerings include high yield debt and core, value-added and opportunistic equity portfolios. Real estate AUM decreased 30% or $7.7 billion during the year, driven by $7.3 billion in market declines and $0.4 billion of net outflows. Commercial real estate markets are expected to continue to struggle through 2010.
Funds of Funds: At December31, 2009, BlackRock managed $22.1 billion of AUM in funds of funds offered under the BlackRock Alternative Advisors (BAA) name. Products include hedge fund, private equity and real asset funds of funds, as well as co-investment and hybrid vehicles. BAA AUM declined $0.6 billion during 2009. Net outflows of $2.9 billion principally stemming from redemption requests submitted at the end of 2008, in addition to a disposition of a $0.2 billion real estate fund of funds portfolio, were almost fully offset by $2.5 billion of growth due to strong investment performance and market appreciation.

BUSINESS (continued) Products (continued) Alternative Investments (continued)  Hedge Funds: BlackRock ended 2009 with $24.9 billion of AUM in a variety of fixed income and equity hedge funds, global macro funds, portable alpha, distressed and opportunistic strategies. Offerings include both open-end hedge funds and similar products, and closed-end funds that have been created to take advantage of specific opportunities over a defined, often longer-term investment horizon. During the year, we added $13.8 billion of AUM through the acquisitions of BGI and the R3 Capital Partners funds. On a pro forma combined basis, AUM decreased $1.4 billion, with $5.5 billion of net outflows, including $1.1 billion of disbursements from opportunistic investments, largely offset by $1.3 billion of acquired AUM and an additional $2.8 billion of investment returns and market appreciation.
Currency and Commodity Funds: At year-end, BlackRock managed $35.7 billion in currency and commodity mandates, the vast majority of which were acquired through the BGI Transaction. These products include active currency and currency overlay strategies primarily managed through institutional separate accounts, and commodity portfolios primarily offered as iShares products. Pro forma combined AUM increased $6.7 billion during 2009, driven by $2.3 billion of net new business and $4.4 billion of market appreciation.
Cash Management AUM in cash management products stood at $349.3 billion at December31, 2009, up $10.8 billion, or 3%, from AUM reported at year-end 2008. The BGI Transaction added $59.5 billion of AUM. The 2008 surge in cash management assets reversed in 2009, as investors tired of earning little to no return reallocated to various long-dated strategies offering the potential for higher returns. On a pro forma combined basis, net outflows totaled $59.4 billion, resulting in a 15% decrease in spot AUM and an approximately 10% decline in average AUM relative to 2008.

BlackRock employs a conservative investment style that emphasizes quality, liquidity and superior client service throughout all market cycles. Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. Products include taxable and tax-exempt money market funds and customized separate accounts. Portfolios may be denominated in U.S. dollar, Euro or Sterling. The BGI Transaction added substantial scale in our non-dollar offerings: 63% or $37.5 billion of total acquired cash management AUM was invested in offshore markets.
The cash management team also manages the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios. Securities lending, which is offered as a potential source of incremental returns on long-dated portfolios, is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk management. Fees for securities lending can be structured as a share of earnings or a percentage of the value of the cash collateral. The value of the securities on loan is reported as AUM in the corresponding asset class. The value of the cash collateral is not included in cash management AUM.

BUSINESS (continued) Products (continued) Cash Management (continued) Our cash management clientele remained largely institutional, with 80%, or $280.4 billion, of cash AUM managed on behalf of institutions and 19%, or $67.6 billion, managed for retail investors at year-end 2009. An additional $1.3 billion of cash AUM was managed in iShares products. The investor base was also predominantly domestic, with 76% or $265.4 billion of AUM managed for U.S. and Canadian investors and 24%, or $83.9 billion, managed for international clients, almost all of which were based in EMEA. While we suffered significant net outflows from U.S. clients reallocating out of cash, we attracted net inflows internationally where we gained market share as a relatively new entrant. We expect cash management AUM to remain volatile, with outflows likely as the economy stabilizes and central banks end their quantitative easing programs and eventually raise interest rates.
BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock offers investment systems, risk management, outsourcing and advisory services under the BlackRock Solutions brand name. Over $9.0 trillion of positions are processed on our Aladdin operating platform, which serves as the investment system for BlackRock and a growing number of sophisticated institutional investors.
BlackRock Solutions also offers comprehensive risk reporting via the Green Package  and risk management advisory services, interactive fixed income analytics through our web-based calculator, AnSer  , middle and back office outsourcing services and investment accounting. Clients have also retained BlackRock Solutions for a variety of financial markets advisory engagements, such as valuation and risk assessment of illiquid assets, portfolio restructuring, workouts and dispositions of distressed assets and financial and balance sheet strategies.
As the global capital markets began to recover, clients remained focused on risk management, and demand for BlackRock Solutions continued to grow. During the year, BlackRock Solutions added 48 net new assignments and revenue increased 21% to $477 million. Growth was well balanced across Aladdin , risk management and financial markets advisory services. Advisory AUM increased 11% to $161.2 billion, buoyed by $11.6 billion of net inflows and $4.5 billion of growth driven by market performance in these long-term liquidation portfolios. At year-end, BlackRock Solutions served 130 clients, including banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers and other institutional investors across North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.
The BlackRock Solutions, Aladdin and technology teams are also supporting key aspects of the BGI integration. These efforts, which are expected to continue through 2011, are vital to establishing a unified operating platform and consistent operating processes. We expect the integration of BGIs extensive quantitative tools, risk management models and portfolio construction applications across asset classes to enhance the Aladdin platform over time. Additionally, we will seek to leverage our scale for the benefit of our clients through the creation of a robust global trading platform.
Transition Management Services BlackRock also offers transition management services, involving the temporary oversight of a clients assets as they transition from one manager to another or from one strategy to another. We provide a comprehensive service that includes project management and implementation based on achieving best execution consistent with the clients risk management tolerances. We use Aladdin and other state-of-the-art tools and work closely with BlackRocks trading cost research team to manage four dimensions of risk throughout the transition: exposure, execution, process and operational risk. The average transition assignment is executed within two weeks, although the duration can be longer or shorter depending on the size, complexity and liquidity of the related assets. These portfolios are not included in AUM unless BlackRock has been retained to manage the assets after the transition phase.

At year-end, the mix of products managed for these clients consisted of 48% in equities, 41% in fixed income, 4% in multi-asset class, 5% in alternatives, 1% in advisory and less than 1% in cash management products.
BlackRocks businessin Latin America and Iberia grew significantly during the year, from $6.8billionof reported AUMat year-end 2008 to $21.1billion of AUM in December31, 2009.

BUSINESS (continued) Clients (continued) Institutional Investors (continued)  BlackRock is among the largest managers of pension plan assets in the world, with $1.403 trillion, or 57%, of institutional AUM managed for defined benefit and defined contribution plans for corporations, public funds and union funds at December31, 2009. An additional $61.8 billion or 2.5% of year-end institutional AUM was managed for other tax-exempt investors, including charities, foundations and endowments. Assets managed for these clients grew $313.1 billion on a pro forma combined basis during 2009, as tax-exempt investors reallocated to a variety of products, including tactical and core allocations to index equity and fixed income, liability-driven investments and fiduciary outsourcing services.
We also managed $240.0 billion or 10% of institutional AUM for official institutions, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals, multilateral entities and government ministries and agencies. These clients often require specialized investment policy advice, the use of customized benchmarks, and training support. In addition, BlackRock has been selected to provide a range of financial markets advisory services, including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments counted in advisory AUM, for these clients. During 2009, investment and advisory AUM for official institutions increased 11% or $22.8 billion.
BlackRock is also one of the top two independent managers of assets for insurance companies, which accounted for $200.8 billion or 8% of institutional AUM at year-end. Assets managed on behalf of these clients increased $43.7 billion during 2009, and included $28.8 billion of net new business driven by a continuing trend toward outsourcing of some or all of the investment function by insurance companies globally. Assets managed for other taxable institutions, including corporations, banks and third party fund sponsors for which we provide sub-advisory services, totaled $286.9 billion or 12% of institutional AUM at year-end.

Clients invest primarily in mutual funds, which totaled $289.4 billion or 74% of retail and high net worth AUM at December31, 2009, with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts.

The remainder was split between alternative investments ($10.1 billion, or 2%) and cash management products ($1.3 billion, or less than 1%).
BlackRock brings institutional quality index management to the public market via ETFs with iShares . Our global leadership position in the ETF market is reflected in the size, liquidity and range of our products. As of year-end, we managed three of the top five, six of the top ten, and 13 of the top 20 ETFs by AUM in the marketplace 5 . Our 417 iShares offerings, up from 362 at year-end 2008, were traded on 19 exchanges throughout the world.

BUSINESS (continued) Competition BlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta, investment style and discipline, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service. Certain of the Companys competitors, however, have greater marketing resources than BlackRock, particularly in retail channels. These factors may place BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage and there can be no assurance that the Companys strategies and efforts to maintain its existing AUM and to attract new business will be successful.

BUSINESS (continued) Regulation Virtually all aspects of BlackRocks business are subject to various laws and regulations both in and outside the United States, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, stockholders of registered and unregistered investment companies, trust customers of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (BTC) and the bank subsidiaries of Bank of America and PNC and their customers. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and financial and bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, such as BlackRock and its subsidiaries, have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations, censures and fines.
Recent market disruptions have led to numerous proposals both in and outside the United States for changes in the regulation of the financial services industry. New laws or regulations, or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRocks business activities, could require BlackRock to change certain business practices and could expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and tax costs) and liabilities, as well as reputational harm. Regulatory changes could also lead to business disruptions, could adversely impact the value of assets in which BlackRock has invested directly and/or on behalf of clients, and, to the extent the regulations strictly control the activities of financial services firms, could make it more difficult for BlackRock to conduct certain businesses or distinguish itself from competitors.
Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by our regulators and self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules may directly affect the method of operation and profitability of BlackRock. The profitability of BlackRock also could be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce.
The rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the below discussion is general in nature and does not purport to be complete.
U.S. Regulation Certain of BlackRocks U.S. subsidiaries are subject to regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), the Department of Labor (the DOL), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States (the OCC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the National Futures Association (the NFA), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC) and other government agencies and regulatory bodies. Certain BlackRock U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to various terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering regulations and economic sanctions, laws and regulations established by various agencies.
The Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act), imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as BlackRock, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act), imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as BlackRock. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment advisers registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.
21 Table of Contents Item1.
BUSINESS (continued) Regulation (continued) U.S. Regulation (continued) BlackRocks trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as well as the rules of various U.S. and non-U.S. securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g., volume limitations, reporting obligations) and market regulation policies in the United States and globally. In addition, BlackRock manages a variety of investment funds listed on U.S. and non-U.S. exchanges, which are subject to the rules of such exchanges. Violation of these laws and regulations could result in restrictions on the Companys activities and in damage to its reputation. BlackRock manages a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate funds, collective investment trusts, managed futures funds and hybrid funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the investment community and the public, increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities, the scope of anti-fraud protections, safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters. BlackRock may be adversely affected by new legislation, rule-making or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators.
Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the DOL, insofar as they act as a fiduciary under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require BlackRock to carry bonds ensuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to non-benefit plan clients.
BlackRock has two subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisers, two other subsidiaries that are registered as commodity trading advisers and three additional subsidiaries only registered as commodity pool operators with the CFTC. All seven of these subsidiaries are members of the NFA. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. Four of BlackRocks other subsidiaries, BlackRock Investments, LLC (BRIL), BlackRock Capital Markets, LLC, BlackRock Execution Services, and BlackRock Fund Distribution Company (BFDC) are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealers permitted activities. BRIL is also an approved person with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). BRIL and BFDC are members of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) and are subject to MSRB rules.

BUSINESS (continued) Regulation (continued) U.S. Banking Regulation Each of Bank of America and PNC is a bank holding company and a financial holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHC Act). Because the ownership interests of each of Bank of America and PNC in BlackRock exceeds 25% on an economic or voting basis, BlackRock is deemed to be a non-bank subsidiary of Bank of America and PNC and is therefore subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve and to most banking laws, regulations and orders that apply to Bank of America and PNC. The supervision and regulation of Bank of America, PNC and their respective subsidiaries under applicable banking laws is intended primarily for the protection of their respective banking subsidiaries, their depositors, the deposit insurance funds of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the banking system as a whole, rather than for the protection of stockholders, creditors or clients of Bank of America, PNC or BlackRock. Bank of Americas and PNCs relationships and good standing with their regulators are important to the conduct of BlackRocks business. BlackRock may also be subject to foreign banking laws and supervision that could affect its business.
BTC is a national trust company that does not accept deposits and is a member of the Federal Reserve System. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as capital adequacy, regulations governing fiduciaries, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. BTC is also subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates. These laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTCs customers, and not BTC, BTCs affiliates or shareholders.
BlackRock generally may conduct only activities that are authorized for a financial holding company under the BHC Act. Investment management is an authorized activity, but must be conducted within applicable regulatory requirements, which in some cases are more restrictive than those BlackRock faces under applicable securities laws. BlackRock may also invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which it provides advisory, administrative or other services, to the extent consistent with applicable law and regulatory interpretations. The Federal Reserve has broad powers to approve, deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices for BlackRock to conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses or assets, or reconfigure existing operations. There are limits on the ability of bank subsidiaries of Bank of America and PNC to extend credit to or conduct other transactions with BlackRock. Bank of America, PNC and their subsidiaries are also subject to examination by various banking regulators, which results in examination reports and ratings that may adversely impact the conduct and growth of BlackRocks businesses.
The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over BlackRock, including the power to prohibit BlackRock from conducting any activity that, in the Federal Reserves opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting BlackRocks business. The Federal Reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of applicable banking laws, regulations and orders.
Any failure of either Bank of America or PNC to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain BlackRock activities and its growth. Such a change of status could be caused by any failure of one of Bank of Americas or PNCs bank subsidiaries to remain well capitalized, by any examination downgrade of one of Bank of Americas or PNCs bank subsidiaries, or by any failure of one of Bank of Americas or PNCs bank subsidiaries to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act.
Non-U.S. Regulation BlackRocks international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. regulatory agencies and bodies. As BlackRock continues to expand its international business, a number of its subsidiaries and international operations have become subject to regulatory systems comparable to those affecting its operations in the United States.
23 Table of Contents Item1.
BUSINESS (continued) Regulation (continued) Non-U.S. Regulation (continued) The Financial Services Authority (the FSA) regulates BlackRocks subsidiaries in the United Kingdom. Authorization by the FSA is required to conduct any financial services related business in the United Kingdom pursuant to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FSAs rules govern a firms capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients and systems and controls. Breaches of these rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against the Companys U.K.-regulated subsidiaries. In addition, these subsidiaries and other European subsidiaries and branches, must comply with the pan-European regime established by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), which came into effect on November1, 2007 and regulates the provision of investment services throughout the European Economic Area, as well as the Capital Requirements Directive, which delineates regulatory capital requirements. MiFID sets out more detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. It also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity markets and more extensive transaction reporting requirements.
The United Kingdom has adopted the MiFID rules into national legislation, as have those other European jurisdictions (excluding Switzerland which is not part of the EU) in which BlackRock has a presence. However, the introduction of further new regulations that will apply to BlackRocks European activities remains likely as a result of further EU-wide legislation. A review of MiFID by the European Commission is mandated for 2010 to report on the need for extensions to the pre- and post-trade transparency obligations and may result in further rules in this area. A new EU directive, the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, is currently in draft form and is likely to be implemented in 2013. This will regulate managers of, and service providers to, alternative investment funds domiciled within Europe and the marketing of all alternative investment funds into Europe. There are also ongoing plans to reform the framework to which regulated firms are subject, including in relation to regulatory capital and the protection of client assets.
In addition to the FSA, the activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices are overseen by comparable regulators in Germany, The Netherlands, Ireland, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey, France, Belgium, Italy, Poland, Spain and Sweden. Regulators in these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant or cancel required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements. Other BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices are regulated in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, India, Dubai, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Canada.
In Japan, certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (the FIEL) and the Law Concerning Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the JFSA), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEL.
In Australia, BlackRocks subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (the ASIC) and the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (the APRA). The ASIC regulates companies and financial services in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection. The APRA is the prudential regulator of the Australian financial services industry and oversees banks, credit unions, building societies, general insurance and reinsurance companies, life insurance, friendly societies and most members of the superannuation (pension) industry. Failure to comply with applicable law and regulations could result in the cancellation, suspension or variation of the regulated subsidiaries licenses in Australia.
24 Table of Contents Item1.
BUSINESS (continued) Regulation (continued) The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (the SFO) which governs the securities and futures markets and the non-bank retail leveraged foreign exchange market in Hong Kong. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (the SFC), an independent non-governmental body. The relevant subsidiaries, and certain individuals representing them, which conduct business in any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are generally required to be registered or licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC from time to time.
There are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many other non-U.S. jurisdictions where BlackRocks subsidiaries are authorized to conduct business.

RISK FACTORS As a leading investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of BlackRocks business. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. While BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market and operating risks, BlackRocks business, financial condition, operating results or non-operating results could be materially adversely affected, however, by any of the following risks.
Risks Related to BlackRocks Business and Competition Changes in the value levels of the capital markets or other asset classes could lead to a decline in revenues and earnings.
BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns earned on AUM. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory, administration and performance fees or earnings:  the value of AUM to decrease;  the returns realized on AUM to decrease;  clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve;  clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that it does not manage;  clients to rebalance assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees; and  an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill.
Poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues and earnings.
The Companys management believes that investment performance is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of AUM. Poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks or to competitors could reduce revenues and cause earnings to decline as a result of:  existing clients withdrawing funds in favor of better performing products, which could result in lower investment advisory and administration fees;  the diminishing ability to attract funds from existing and new clients;  the Company earning minimal or no performance fees; and  an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill.
BlackRock may elect to provide support to its products from time to time.
BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time support investment products through capital or credit support. See, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources. Such support utilizes capital that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. Losses on such support, or failure to have or devote sufficient capital to support products, could have an adverse impact on revenues and earnings.
Changes in the value levels of the capital markets or other asset classes could lead to a decline in the value of investments that BlackRock owns.
At December31, 2009, BlackRock held approximately $1 billion of investments that are reflected on its statement of financial condition. Approximately $0.5 billion of this amount is the result of consolidation of certain sponsored investment funds. BlackRocks economic interest in these investments is primarily the result of seed and co-investments in its sponsored investment funds. A decline in the prices of stocks or bonds, or the value of real estate or other alternative investments within or outside the United States could lower the value of these investments and result in a decline of non-operating income and increased volatility to earnings.
26 Table of Contents Item1A.
RISK FACTORS (continued) Continued capital losses on investments could have adverse income tax consequences.
The Company may generate realized and unrealized capital losses on seed investments and co-investments. Realized capital losses may be carried back three years and carried forward five years and offset against realized capital gains for federal income tax purposes. The Company has unrealized capital losses for which a deferred tax asset has been established. In the event such unrealized losses are realized, the Company may not be able to offset such losses within the carryback or carryforward period or from future realized capital gains, in which case the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The failure to utilize the deferred tax asset could materially increase BlackRock's income tax expense.
The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect BlackRock.
Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. BlackRock, and the products and accounts that it manages, have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose BlackRock or the funds and accounts that it manages to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely impact BlackRocks revenues and earnings.
The failure or negative performance of productsof other financial institutions could lead to reduced AUM in similar productsof BlackRock without regard to the performance of BlackRocks products.
The failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to a loss of confidence in similar productsof BlackRock without regard to the performance of BlackRocks products. Such a negative contagion could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products and have a material adverse impact on our AUM, revenues and earnings.
Loss of key employees could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues.
The ability to attract and retain quality personnel has contributed significantly to BlackRocks growth and success and is important to attracting and retaining clients. The market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, financial advisers and other professionals is competitive. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain required personnel. Loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on the Company.
BlackRocks investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors.
Separate account and commingled trust clients may terminate their investment management contracts with BlackRock or withdraw funds on short notice. The Company has, from time to time, lost separate accounts and could, in the future, lose accounts or significant AUM under various circumstances such as adverse market conditions or poor performance.
Additionally, BlackRock manages its U.S. mutual funds and exchanged traded funds under management contracts with the funds that must be renewed and approved by the funds boards of directors annually. A majority of the directors of each mutual fund are independent from BlackRock. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the board of directors of each fund managed by the Company will approve the funds management contract each year, or will not condition its approval on the terms of the management contract being revised in a way that is adverse to the Company .
Further, the governing agreements of many of the Companys private investment funds generally provide that, subject to certain conditions, investors in those funds, and in some cases independent directors of those funds, may remove the investment adviser, general partner or the equivalent of the fund or liquidate the fund without cause by a simple majority vote, resulting in a reduction in the management or performance fees as well as the total carried interest BlackRock could earn.
27 Table of Contents Item1A.
RISK FACTORS (continued) Failure to comply with client contractual requirements and/or guidelines could result in damage awards against BlackRock and loss of revenues due to client terminations.
When clients retain BlackRock to manage assets or provide products or services on their behalf, they specify guidelines or contractual requirements that the Company is required to observe in the provision of its services. A failure to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in damage to BlackRocks reputation or in its clients seeking to recover losses, withdrawing their AUM or terminating their contracts, any of which could cause the Companys revenues and earnings to decline.
Competitive fee pressures could reduce revenues and profit margins.
The investment management business is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. To the extent that the Company is forced to compete on the basis of price, it may not be able to maintain its current fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or future new business could cause revenues and profit margins to decline.
Performance fees may increase earnings volatility, which could decrease BlackRocks stock price.
A portion of the Companys revenues is derived from performance fees on investment and risk management advisory assignments. In most cases, performance fees are based on relative or absolute investment returns, although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards. Generally, the Company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, performance fees for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the Company may not earn performance fees in future periods. Performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns and the timing of revenue recognition, causing earnings to be more volatile. The volatility in earnings may decrease BlackRocks stock price. Performance fees represented $202 million, or 4%, of total revenue for the year ended December31, 2009.
Additional acquisitions may decrease earnings and harm the Companys competitive position.
BlackRock employs a variety of strategies intended to enhance earnings and expand product offerings in order to improve profit margins. These strategies have included smaller-sized lift-outs of investment teams and acquisitions of investment management businesses, such as the MLIM, Quellos and BGI Transactions. These strategies may not be effective and failure to successfully develop and implement these strategies may decrease earnings and harm the Companys competitive position in the investment management industry. In the event BlackRock pursues additional sizeable acquisitions, it may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at acceptable prices and it may not be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from such acquisitions.
28 Table of Contents Item1A.
RISK FACTORS (continued) Risks Related to BlackRocks Operations Failure to maintain adequate infrastructure could impede BlackRocks productivity and growth.
The Companys infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers, backup facilities and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. The failure to maintain an adequate infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of its business, including any expansion, could impede the Companys productivity and growth, which could cause the Companys earnings or stock price to decline.
Operating in international markets increases BlackRocks operational, regulatory and other risks.
As a result of BlackRocks extensive international business activities, the Company faces increased operational, regulatory, reputational and foreign exchange rate risks. The failure of the Companys systems of internal control to properly mitigate such additional risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support such international activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions, which could cause the Companys earnings or stock price to decline.
Failure to maintain a technological advantage could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in revenues.
A key element to BlackRocks continued success is the ability to maintain a technological advantage both in terms of operational efficiency and in providing the sophisticated risk analytics incorporated into BlackRocks operating systems that support investment advisory and BlackRock Solutions clients. Moreover, the Companys technological and software advantage is dependent on a number of third parties who provide various types of data. The failure of these third parties to provide such data or software could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact BlackRocks ability to provide services to its investment advisory and BlackRock Solutions clients. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain this technological advantage or be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in these systems and processes.
Failure to implement effective information security policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that could result in a decrease in BlackRocks earnings or stock price.
BlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of its information security policies, procedures and capabilities to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them. An externally caused information security incident, such as a hacker attack, virus or worm, or an internally caused issue, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential information and could result in material financial loss, regulatory actions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, could cause a decline in the Companys earnings or stock price.
The failure of a key vendor to BlackRock to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock and its products.
BlackRock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration, custody and transfer agent roles and other operational needs. The failure or inability of BlackRock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendors to fulfill their obligations could lead to operational issues in certain products, which could result in financial losses for the Company and its clients.

RISK FACTORS (continued) The continuing integration of the BGI business creates risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect profitability.
The BGI business and personnel are in the process of being integrated with BlackRocks previously existing business and personnel. These transition activities are complex and the Company may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs including:  the diversion of managements attention to integration matters;  difficulties in achieving expected synergies associated with the transaction;  difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;  difficulties in the assimilation of employees;  challenges in keeping existing clients and obtaining new clients, including potential conflicts of interest and client imposed concentration limits on the use of an investment manager; and  challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel.
As a result, the Company may not be able to realize the expected revenue growth and other benefits that it hopes to achieve from the transaction. In addition, BlackRock may be required to spend additional time or money on integration that would otherwise be spent on the development and expansion of its business and services.
Failure to manage risks in operating securities lending for clients could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in revenues and liquidity The size of BlackRocks securities lending programs increased significantly with the completion of the BGI transaction. As part of these programs, BlackRock must manage risks associated with (i)ensuring that the value of the collateral held against the securities on loan does not decline in value or become illiquid and that its nature and value complies with regulatory requirements, (ii)the potential that a borrower may not return a security on a timely basis, (iii)the potential that the collateral held may not be sufficient to repurchase the loaned security, and (iv)errors in the settlement of securities, daily mark-to-market valuations and collateral collection. The failure of the Companys controls to mitigate these risks could result in financial losses for our clients that participate in our securities lending programs as well as for the Company.
Risks Related to Relationships with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC, Barclays and Other Institutional Investors Merrill Lynch is an important distributor of BlackRocks products, and the Company is therefore subject to risks associated with the business of Merrill Lynch.
Under a global distribution agreement entered into with Merrill Lynch, Merrill Lynch provides distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock investment management products and services through its various distribution channels. The Company may not be successful in distributing products through Merrill Lynch or in distributing its products and services through other third party distributors. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it experiences an increase in distribution-related costs, BlackRocks business, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected.
30 Table of Contents Item1A.
RISK FACTORS (continued) Loss of market share with Merrill Lynchs Global Wealth& Investment Management business could harm operating results.
A significant portion of BlackRocks revenue has historically come from AUM generated by Merrill Lynchs Global Wealth& Investment Management (GWIM) business. BlackRocks ability to maintain a strong relationship with GWIM is material to the Companys future performance. If one of the Companys competitors gains significant additional market share within the GWIM retail channel at the expense of BlackRock, then BlackRocks business, results of operations or financial condition may be negatively impacted.
The failure of Barclays to fulfill its commitments, or the inadequacy of the support provided, under certain capital support agreements in favor of a number of securities lending related cash management funds acquired in the BGI Transaction, could negatively impact such funds and BlackRock.
Barclays has provided capital support agreements to support certain securities lending related cash management products acquired by BlackRock in the BGI Transaction. The failure of Barclays to fulfill its obligations under these agreements, or the inadequacy of the support provided, could cause our clients to suffer losses and BlackRock to suffer reputational and other adverse impacts. For a discussion on the capital support agreements see Management, Discussion and Analysis  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Barclays Support of Certain Securities Lending Related Cash Funds.
For so long as Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC and Barclays maintain certain levels of stock ownership, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC and Barclays will vote as stockholders in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRocks Board of Directors, and certain actions will require special board approval or the prior approval of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC and Barclays.
Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC and Barclays have agreed to vote all of their shares in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRocks Board of Directors to the extent consistent with the provisions of their respective stockholder agreements with BlackRock. As a consequence, matters submitted to a stockholder vote that require a majority or a plurality of votes for approval, including elections of directors, will likely be approved or disapproved solely in accordance with the determinations of the BlackRock Board of Directors, so long as the shares held by Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC and Barclays constitute a substantial portion of the outstanding shares. This arrangement has the effect of concentrating control over BlackRock in its Board of Directors, whether or not stockholders agree with any particular determination of the Board. At December31, 2009, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC and Barclays owned approximately 3.7%, 35.2% and 4.8%, respectively, of BlackRocks voting common stock.
The majority of our stock is held by a group of large shareholders. Future sales of our common stock in the public market by us or our large stockholders could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
As of December31, 2009, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC and Barclays owned 34.2%, 24.5% and 19.8% of our capital stock, respectively. In connection with the BGI Transaction, 16.4million shares were sold to other institutional investors. We have entered into registration rights agreements with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC and Barclays, as well as the institutional investors who purchased shares of BlackRock capital stock in connection with the BGI Transaction. The registration rights agreements, which include customary piggyback registration provisions, allow the respective stockholders to cause us to file one or more registration statements for the resale of their respective shares of capital stock and cooperate in certain underwritten offerings. Sales by us or our large stockholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market pursuant to registration rights or otherwise, or the perception that these sales might occur, couldcause the market price of our common stock to decline.
31 Table of Contents Item1A.
RISK FACTORS (continued) Legal and Regulatory Risks BlackRock is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and internationally.
BlackRocks business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and around the world. See the discussion under the heading Business  Regulation. Violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, temporary or permanent prohibition of the engagement in certain activities, reputational harm, suspensions of personnel or revocation of their licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser or broker-dealer registrations, or other sanctions, which could cause the Companys earnings or stock price to decline.
BlackRock may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory changes in the United States and internationally.
Recent market disruptions have led to numerous proposals in the United States and internationally for changes in the regulation of the financial services industry. New laws or regulations, or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRocks business activities, could require BlackRock to change certain business practices and could expose BlackRock to additional costs (including increased capital, compliance and tax costs) as well as reputational harm. Regulatory changes could also lead to business disruptions, could adversely impact the value of assets in which BlackRock has invested directly and on behalf of clients, and, to the extent the regulations strictly control the activities of financial services firms, could make it more difficult for BlackRock to conduct certain businesses or to distinguish itself from competitors.
Failure to comply with the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act and related regulations could result in substantial harm to BlackRocks reputation and results of operations.
Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act and BlackRocks U.S. mutual funds are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations and fiduciary duties on registered investment advisers, including record-keeping, operating and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act imposes similar obligations, as well as additional detailed operational requirements, on investment advisers to registered investment companies. The failure of any of BlackRocks subsidiaries to comply with the Advisers Act or the Investment Company Act could cause the SEC to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of either of these acts, including censure, termination of an investment advisers registration or prohibition to serve as adviser to SEC-registered funds, and could lead to litigation by investors in those funds or harm to the Companys reputation, any of which could cause its earnings or stock price to decline.
Failure to comply with ERISA regulations could result in penalties and cause the Companys earnings or stock price to decline.
Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to ERISA and to regulations promulgated thereunder, insofar as they act as a fiduciary under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit specified transactions involving ERISA plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions. The failure of any of the relevant subsidiaries to comply with these requirements could result in significant penalties that could reduce the Companys earnings or cause its stock price to decline.
32 Table of Contents Item1A.
RISK FACTORS (continued) BlackRock is subject to banking regulations that may limit its business activities.
Because the total equity ownership interest of each of Bank of America and PNC in BlackRock exceeds 25% on an economic or voting basis, BlackRock is deemed to be a non-bank subsidiary of each of Bank of America and PNC, which are both financial holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. As a non-bank subsidiary of Bank of America and PNC, BlackRock is subject to banking regulation, including the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve. Such banking regulation limits the activities and the types of businesses that BlackRock may conduct. The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over BlackRock, including the power to prohibit BlackRock from conducting any activity that, in the Federal Reserves opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting BlackRocks business, and to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations. Any failure of either Bank of America or PNC to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain BlackRock activities and its growth. In addition, BlackRocks trust bank subsidiary is subject to regulation by the OCC parallel in many respects to that imposed under the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act as described above and to capital requirements established by the OCC. The OCC has broad enforcement authority over BlackRocks trust bank subsidiary. Being subject to banking regulation may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because most of its competitors are not subject to these limitations.
Failure to comply with laws and regulations in the United Kingdom, other member states of the European Union, Hong Kong, Japan, Australia and other non-U.S. jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates could result in substantial harm to BlackRocks reputation and results of operations.
The Financial Services Authority (the FSA) regulates BlackRocks subsidiaries in the United Kingdom. Authorization by the FSA is required to conduct any financial services-related business in the United Kingdom under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FSAs rules govern a firms capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients and systems and controls. Breaches of these rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against the Companys U.K.-regulated subsidiaries.
In addition, these subsidiaries, and other European subsidiaries, branches or representative offices, must comply with the pan-European regime established by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, which regulates the provision of investment services throughout the European Economic Area, as well as the Capital Requirements Directive, which delineates regulatory capital requirements.
In Japan, certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (the FIEL) and the Law Concerning Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the JFSA), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEL.
In Australia, BlackRocks subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (the ASIC) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. The ASIC regulates companies and financial services in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection. Failure to comply with applicable law and regulations could result in the cancellation, suspension or variation of the relevant subsidiaries licenses in Australia.
33 Table of Contents Item1A.
RISK FACTORS (continued) The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (the SFO) which governs the securities and futures markets and the non-bank retail leveraged foreign exchange market in Hong Kong. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (the SFC), an independent non-governmental body. The relevant subsidiaries, and certain individuals representing them, which conduct business in any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are generally required to be registered or licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC from time to time.
There are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many other non-U.S. jurisdictions where BlackRocks subsidiaries conduct business or where the funds and products it manages are organized. Failure to comply with laws and regulations in any of these jurisdictions could result in substantial harm to BlackRocks reputation and results of operation.
Legal proceedings could adversely affect operating results and financial condition for a particular period.
Many aspects of BlackRocks business involve substantial risks of legal liability. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRocks activities. From time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide or other investigations or proceedings. Additionally, certain of the investment funds that the Company manages are subject to lawsuits, any of which could potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the Company being liable to the funds for any resulting damages.
The legislative and economic effects of climate change could impact investment strategies and the value of assets that BlackRock manages.
BlackRock invests in a variety of sectors on behalf of its clients. To the extent certain of these sectors are negatively impacted by climate change or legislation or international agreements related to climate change, the value of, and the returns realized on, the related AUM could decrease or cause clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in sectors that BlackRock may not offer.
34 Table of Contents Item1B.
UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS The Company has no unresolved comments from the SEC staff relating to BlackRocks periodic or current reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act of 1934.
Item2.
PROPERTIES BlackRocks principal office, which is leased, is located at 55 East 52nd Street, New York, New York. BlackRock leases additional office space in New York City at 40 East 52nd Street and throughout the world, including Boston, Chicago, Edinburgh, Florham Park (New Jersey), Hong Kong, London, Melbourne, Munich, Plainsboro (New Jersey), San Francisco, Seattle, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. The Company also owns an 84,500 square foot office building in Wilmington (Delaware).
Item3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various U.S. federal, state governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide or other investigations or proceedings. It is BlackRocks policy to fully cooperate with such inquiries. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRocks activities. Additionally, certain of the investment funds that the Company manages are subject to lawsuits, any of which could potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the Company being liable to the funds for any resulting damages.
Management, after consultation with legal counsel, currently does not anticipate that the aggregate liability, if any, arising out of regulatory matters or lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on BlackRocks earnings, financial position, or cash flows although, at the present time, management is not in a position to determine whether any such pending or threatened matters will have a material adverse effect on BlackRocks results of operations in any future reporting period.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis; however, management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Certain prior period non-GAAP data has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Computations for all periods are derived from the Companys consolidated statements of income as follows: (a) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income, as adjusted, equals operating income, GAAP basis, excluding certain items deemed non-recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value, as indicated in the table below. Operating income used for operating margin measurement equals operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income used for operating margin measurement, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc.
Financial Highlights (continued) (a) (continued) Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRocks financial performance over time. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors.
Operating income, as adjusted: Restructuring charges recorded in 2008 and 2009 consist of compensation costs, occupancy costs and professional fees. MLIM and Quellos integration costs recorded in 2007 consist principally of certain professional fees, rebranding costs and compensation costs incurred in conjunction with these integrations. BGI transaction/integration costs recorded in 2009 consist principally of certain advisory fees, compensation expense, legal fees and consulting expenses incurred in conjunction with the BGI transaction. The expenses associated with: (i)the 2008 and 2009 restructuring, (ii)BGI transaction and integration costs, (iii)MLIM and Quellos integration costs and (iv)the 2007 termination of the closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch have been deemed non-recurring by management and have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, to help enhance the comparability of this information to prior periods. As such, management believes that operating margins exclusive of these costs are useful measures in evaluating BlackRocks operating performance for the respective periods.
The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (LTIP) that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and a Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution, a portion of which has been received, have been excluded because these charges ultimately do not impact BlackRocks book value.
Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non-operating income.
Operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Companys results until future periods.
Operating margin, as adjusted, allows the Company to compare performance from period-to-period by adjusting for items that may not recur, recur infrequently or may fluctuate based on market movements, such as restructuring charges, transaction/integration costs, closed-end fund launch costs and fluctuations in compensation expense based on mark-to-market movements in investments held to fund certain compensation plans. The Company also uses operating margin, as adjusted, to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance to other companies. Management uses both the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the financial performance for BlackRock. The non-GAAP measure by itself may pose limitations because it does not include all of the Companys revenues and expenses.
Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and to other third parties. Management believes that excluding such costs is useful to BlackRock because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. Reimbursable property management compensation represented compensation and benefits paid to personnel of Metric Property Management, Inc. (Metric), a subsidiary of BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (Realty). Prior to the transfer in 2008, these employees were retained on Metrics payroll when certain properties were acquired by Realtys clients. The related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by Realtys clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they did not bear an economic cost to BlackRock. For each of these items, BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues.

Financial Highlights (continued) (b) Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted: Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests (NCI), as adjusted, equals non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis, less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, GAAP basis, adjusted for compensation expense associated with depreciation (appreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans. The compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis.
Year ended December31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis $ (6 ) $ (577 ) $ 526 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to NCI, GAAP basis 22 (155 ) 364 Non-operating income (expense) 1 (28 ) (422 ) 162 Compensation expense related to (appreciation) depreciation on deferred compensation plans (18 ) 38 (12 ) Non-operating income (expense), as adjusted 1 $ (46 ) $ (384 ) $ 150 1 Includes net income (loss) attributable to NCI (redeemable and nonredeemable) related to investment and non-investment activities.
Management believes that non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted, provides for comparability of this information to prior periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRocks non-operating contribution to its results. As compensation expense associated with depreciation (appreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, offsets the gain/(loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes that non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks non-operating results that impact book value.

The portion of the compensation expense associated with LTIP awards that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and the Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution, a portion of which has been received, have been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, because these charges ultimately do not impact BlackRocks book value. The termination of the closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non-recurring by management.
During third quarter 2009, legislation was enacted primarily with respect to New York City corporate income taxes, effective January1, 2009, which resulted in a revaluation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities. The resulting decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, as it is non-recurring, it does not ultimately impact cash flows and to enhance comparability to prior reporting periods.

Financial Highlights (continued) (c) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted (continued): During third quarter 2007, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income taxes, effective in April and January of 2008, respectively, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. The resulting decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as it is non-recurring, it does not ultimately impact cash flows and to enhance comparability to current and prior reporting periods.
(d) For the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 non-GAAP adjustments were tax effected at 30%, 33% and 36%, respectively, which reflect the blended rate applicable to the adjustments.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and Germany. The Company provides a wide array of taxable and tax-exempt fixed income, equity and balanced investment funds, including exchange traded funds and mutual funds, and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index-based equity and alternative investment products for a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for investment funds and other non-U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non-U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The BlackRock Global Funds, the Companys primary retail fund group offered outside the United States, are authorized for distribution in more than 35 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include various open-end and closed-end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non-U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets.
BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third-party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes its products and services through Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, which, following Bank of Americas acquisition of Merrill Lynch, runs through January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three-year extension if certain conditions are met. See Note 17, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.
BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM, percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products, or, in the case of certain real estate equity clients, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts, purchases and redemptions of investment fund shares and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts.
BlackRock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. Such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis. The security loans are secured by collateral in the form of cash and securities, ranging from approximately 102% to 108% of the value of the loaned securities. The net income earned on the collateral is shared between BlackRock and the funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed.
Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees, based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services related to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i)fixed fees, (ii)percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii)performance fees if contractual thresholds are met.
The Company also earns fees for transition management services comprised of referral fees or agency commissions from acting as an introducing broker-dealer in buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. Commissions and related clearing expenses related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur.
Operating expenses reflect employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, direct fund expenses, general and administration expenses and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets.
Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, commissions, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes and related benefit costs.
Distribution and servicing costs include payments made to Merrill Lynch-affiliated entities under a global distribution agreement and to PNC-affiliated entities, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products.
Direct fund expenses consist primarily of third party non-advisory expenses incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of certain index trademarks, reference data for certain indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expenses, audit and tax services as well as other fund related expenses directly attributable to the non-advisory operations of the fund. These expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in AUM, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business.
BlackRock holds investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, distressed credit/mortgage debt securities, hedge funds and real estate. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans, or for regulatory purposes. Non-operating income (expense) and other comprehensive income for available-for-sale investments includes the impact of changes in the valuations or pick up of equity method earnings of these investments, as well as interest income and interest expense.

5 Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments.
Business Outlook The Company began 2010 with a substantially increased AUM base as a result of the BGI Transaction and strong market and organic growth in 2009. At the same time, domestic and international markets continue to be volatile as a result of investor concerns that the global economy is weaker than investors expected. The U.S. housing market, employment levels, debt levels in European nations and the stability of certain foreign currencies are heightening investor anxiety in the early part of 2010. The timing and direction of these volatile markets, investment performance and the level of new client asset flows will have a direct impact on the Companys revenue. With the BGI Transaction, the Company offers an expanded range of products with investment objectives to track various indices and others that target returns in excess of specified benchmarks as well as liquidity funds. Consequently, BlackRock should be well positioned to meet these challenges, as well as navigate the following issues that may also impact the Companys results in 2010:  The levels of institutional liquidity assets may continue to decline from year-end levels. These assets are expected to be redeployed to direct investment, bank deposits or longer-dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys diversified global product offerings, client service and independent advice may enable it to retain a portion of these assets.
Additionally, as investors shift their preferences between active and passive investment styles, the Companys broad active and passive product profile ability should enable it to retain and capture AUM as it has a wide array of offerings in both product styles.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook (continued)  The regulatory environment is evolving for financial institutions. The SEC has enacted reforms to Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, governing money market funds with the intent to protect the industry and our clients. The SEC indicated there is likely to be a second round of changes governing money market funds. These changes, should they be enacted, may affect the margins of the money market industry and may affect industry participants differently depending on scale. Other financial services reforms may favor the separation of fiduciary management and banking activities from proprietary investing. BlackRock acts as an independent asset manager and does not engage in proprietary trading or deposit taking activities.
The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption gave rise to greater demand for our advisory services, combining our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While the demand for these services remained high through the volatile markets, demand for short-term advisory services may decline as market concerns ease. A meaningful percentage of BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues in 2009 was composed of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees. At the same time, as markets have stabilized, we have seen clients investing in longer-term risk and systems solutions.
A return to higher market levels may enable the Companys alternative investment products with absolute return objectives to contribute additional performance fee revenue. However, such fees are dependent on achieving investor high water marks.
The global exchange traded funds market is expected to continue to grow. BlackRock has a large array of products and assets under management in this market. As a first mover in several products, many of the iShares products have achieved a critical mass, providing both liquidity to investors and minimizing the difference between the unit exchange traded market values and the underlying unit net asset values. As additional asset managers enter the marketplace to offer exchange traded funds, the Companys market share may decline even while the overall market grows.
The Company will continue to assess the appropriateness of its cost structure as it integrates BGI. The Company may decide to take additional measures to reduce costs. The benefits of any cost reduction measures may be realized over time and may or may not require upfront costs.
At the same time, the Company plans to invest in future growth opportunities. There may be opportunities where the cost in the current period will precede the expected future revenue.
Certain costs, such as direct fund expenses and cash incentive compensation, will tend to move in line with revenue. As stock awards are expensed subsequent to their grant date, the associated expense will not vary with future revenues. The stock awards related to 2009 performance will be expensed in 2010 and subsequent years.
Real estate costs are expected to increase. We leased new space, most notably in London, on which we will begin incurring rent expense even though we will not move into that space until it is fully built out in 2011. The Company has not completed analyzing its requirements in all other locations impacted by the acquisition of BGI.
Marketing expenses, including travel and entertainment, are expected to increase to levels which reflect our increased client base, a more geographically diverse firm and additional client opportunities.
The effective tax rate of the Company is affected, among other things, by the geographic distribution of earnings and global changes in tax legislation, including efforts by governments to raise taxes to reduce projected deficits. The effective tax rate may vary from period to period as a result of these factors.

Total revenue for the year ended December31, 2009 includes $312 million of incremental revenue related to the BGI acquisition. The $364 million decrease was the result of a $431 million decrease in total investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, a $39 million decrease in distribution fees and a $3 million decrease in other revenue, offset by an $84 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue and a $25 million increase in performance fees.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 200 9, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2008 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue for the year ended December31, 2009 included approximately $278 million of fees related to the BGI acquisition. The decrease in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues of $431 million for the year ended December31, 2009, compared with the year ended December31, 2008 consisted of decreases of $357 million in active equity products, $40 million in multi-asset class products, $141 million in alternative investment products, $7 million in active fixed income products and $83 million in cash management products primarily associated with a market driven reduction in average AUM for equity, multi-asset class and alternative products and net redemptions in cash management products. The decrease is offset by a $164 million increase in equity index products and a $33 million increase in fixed income index products primarily related to products acquired in the BGI acquisition.
Performance Fees Investment advisory performance fees increased $25 million, or 14%, to $202 million for the year ended December31, 2009, as compared to $177 million for the year ended December31, 2008, primarily due to an increase in performance fees in alternative equity hedge funds, fixed income and multi-asset class separate accounts, offset by a decrease in international equity separate accounts. The year ended December31, 2009 included $24 million of performance fees related to the BGI acquisition.
BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue for the year ended December31, 2009 increased $84 million, or 21%, compared with the year ended December31, 2008. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory assignments during the period, as well as additional Aladdin and risk management mandates. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of advisory and portfolio structuring assignment fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments.
Distribution Fees Distribution fees decreased $39 million to $100 million for the year ended December31, 2009, as compared to $139 million for the year ended December31, 2008. The decrease in distribution fees was primarily the result of lower sales, redemptions and AUM in certain share classes of open-end mutual funds.

The decrease in other revenue was primarily the result of a $31 million decline in property management fees primarily related to the outsourcing in the fourth quarter of 2008 of Metric contracts with BlackRock real estate clients, partially offset by a $14 million increase in BlackRocks share of underlying earnings from certain operating and advisory company investments and a $9 million increase in fees earned for transition management services.

Excluding certain items deemed non-recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not effect the Companys book value, total expenses, as adjusted, decreased $272 million, or 8%. The decrease in total expenses, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to decreases in employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs and amortization of deferred mutual funds sales commissions.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December31, 2009, as compared with the year ended December31, 2008 (continued) Expenses (continued) Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $13 million, or 1%, to $1,802 million, for the year ended December31, 2009, compared to $1,815 million for the year ended December31, 2008. Employee compensation and benefits expense for the year ended December31, 2009 included $89 million of incremental expense related to an increase in the number of employees related to BGI.
The decrease in employee compensation and benefits expense was attributable to a $118 million decrease in salaries, benefits and commissions, a $12 million decrease in incentive compensation associated with lower operating income, partially offset by a $60 million increase related to the BGI integration costs and a $57 million increase in deferred compensation, which is offset primarily by an increase in non-operating income related to appreciation on assets associated with certain deferred compensation plans. The $118 million decrease in salaries, benefits and commissions is due to lower employment levels as a result of the Companys cost control efforts and outsourcing of Metric services, partially offset by a one month impact of the increase in employees related to the BGI Transaction. Employees at December31, 2009 totaled 8,629 as compared to 5,341 at December31, 2008.
Distribution and Servicing Costs Distribution and servicing costs decreased $114 million to $477 million for the year ended December31, 2009, compared to $591 million for the year ended December31, 2008. These costs include payments to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $114 million decrease primarily related to lower levels of average AUM serviced by related parties across all asset classes and an increase in waivers within certain cash management funds, resulting in lower distribution payments.
Distribution and servicing costs for the year ended December31, 2009 included $349 million of costs attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $19 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $464 million and $30 million, respectively, in the year ended December31, 2008. Distribution and servicing costs related to other third parties increased $12 million to $109 million for the year ended December31, 2009, as compared to $97 million for the year ended December31, 2008 due to an expansion of distribution platforms.
Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions decreased $30 million to $100 million for the year ended December31, 2009, as compared to $130 million for the year ended December31, 2008. The decrease in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of lower sales and redemptions in certain share classes of U.S. open-end mutual funds.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December31, 2009, as compared with the year ended December31, 2008 (continued) Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,278 million for the year ended December31, 2009, which was a decrease of $315 million compared to the year ended December31, 2008. Year ended December31, 2009 operating income included $141 million resulting from incremental revenue and expenses related to the operations of BGI and $183 million of BGI transaction and integration costs. The transaction and integration expenses are not part of the on-going business and are principally comprised of advisory fees, compensation expense, legal fees and consulting expenses.
Operating income for the year ended December31, 2009 included the effect of a $431 million decrease in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, associated with a market driven reduction in average AUM for all asset classes for the year ended December31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December31, 2008, a $42 million reduction in distribution fees and other revenue, offset by an $84 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue, a $25 million increase in performance fees revenue and a $49 million net decrease in operating expenses primarily due to declines in employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions and restructuring expenses, offset by increases in direct fund expenses and general and administration expenses.
The Companys operating margin was 27.2% for the year ended December31, 2009, compared to 31.5% for the year ended December31, 2008. The reduction in operating margin in 2009 as compared to 2008 included the effect of $183 million of BGI transaction and integration costs and a change from $50 million of foreign currency remeasurement benefits in 2008 to $11 million of foreign currency remeasurement costs in 2009.
As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,570 million for the year ended December31, 2009, which was a decrease of $92 million compared to the year ended December31, 2008. The decline of operating income, as adjusted, for the year ended December31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December31, 2008 is related to the effect of the $364 million decrease in total revenue offset by a $272 million decrease in operating expenses due to decreases in employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs and general and administration expenses.
Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.2% and 38.7% for the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The reduction in margin includes the effect of the $61 million increase in expenses related to the change in foreign currency remeasurement offset by a reduction of certain expenses as a result of additional cost controls in 2009.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December31, 2007 AUM decreased $49 billion, or 4%, to $1.307 trillion at December31, 2008, compared with $1.357 trillion at December31, 2007. The decline in AUM was attributable to $189 billion in net market depreciation and $28 billion in net foreign exchange movements, partially offset by $168 billion in net subscriptions.
The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM 1 for 2008.
(Dollar amounts in millions) December31, 2007 Net subscriptions (redemptions) 1 Market appreciation (depreciation) Foreign exchange 2 December31, 2008 Equity Index $ 71,381 $ 11,183 $ (31,354 ) $ (134 ) $ 51,076 Active 291,324 (17,204 ) (109,867 ) (12,037 ) 152,216 Fixed income Index 3,942 (612 ) 162 (81 ) 3,411 Active 506,265 (6,247 ) (16,134 ) (5,930 ) 477,954 Multi-asset class 98,623 5,087 (20,134 ) (6,060 ) 77,516 Alternative 71,771 4,971 (13,201 ) (1,997 ) 61,544 Long-dated 1,043,306 (2,822 ) (190,528 ) (26,239 ) 823,717 Cash management 313,338 25,670 1,339 (1,908 ) 338,439 Sub-total 1,356,644 22,848 (189,189 ) (28,147 ) 1,162,156 Advisory 3  144,756 239  144,995 Total $ 1,356,644 $ 167,604 $ (188,950 ) $ (28,147 ) $ 1,307,151 1 Includes distributions representing return of capital and return on investment to investors.
2 Foreign exchange reflects the impact of converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes.
3 Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments.
Net market depreciation of $189 billion was primarily due to depreciation in equity products of $141 billion, as equity markets declined during the year ended December31, 2008, net depreciation on fixed income products of $16 billion, depreciation on multi-asset products of $20 billion and alternative investment products of $13 billion. The $28 billion reduction in AUM from foreign exchange was across all asset classes due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar which resulted in foreign exchange translation loss from converting non U.S.-dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars. Net subscriptions of $168 billion for the year ended December31, 2008 were attributable to net new business of $145 billion in long-term advisory liquidation assignments, $26 billion in cash management products, $5 billion in multi-asset class products and $5 billion in alternative investment products, partially offset by $6 billion and $7 billion of net outflows in equity and fixed income products, respectively.

The $219 million increase was primarily the result of a $220 million increase in total investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, a $203 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue and a $16 million increase in distribution fees, offset by a $173 million decrease in investment advisory performance fees and a $47 million decrease in other revenue.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December31, 2007 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue The increase in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $220 million for the year ended December31, 2008, compared with the year ended December31, 2007, consisted of increases of, $169 million in alternative investment products, $185 million in cash management products and $100 million in multi-asset class products, offset by decreases of $211 million in active and index equity products and $23 million in active fixed income products. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December31, 2008 primarily as a result of increased average AUM in 2008 compared to 2007 for cash management products due to net subscriptions and alternative investment products due to the full year effect of the Quellos Transaction, offset by lower fees in equity products due to the impact of market depreciation on AUM.
Investment Advisory Performance Fees Investment advisory performance fees decreased by $173 million, or 49%, to $177 million for the year ended December31, 2008, as compared to $350 million for the year ended December31, 2007 primarily as a result of lower investment advisory performance fees earned on alternative investment products, including real estate funds and fixed income hedge funds, and international equity products.
BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $393 million for the year ended December31, 2008 increased $203 million, or 107%, compared with the year ended December31, 2007. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory assignments and Aladdin  assignments during the period. A portion of the revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments.
Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $16 million to $139 million for the year ended December31, 2008, as compared to $123 million for the year ended December31, 2007. The increase in distribution fees was primarily due to the full-year effect of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements, as well as an increase in contingent deferred sales commissions as a result of redemptions in certain share classes of open-ended funds.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December31, 2007 (continued) Revenue (continued) Other Revenue Year ended December31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Other revenue: Fund accounting $ 11 $ 27 $ (16 ) (59 )% Commissions revenue 26 37 (11 ) (30 )% Property management fees 32 38 (6 ) (16 )% Transition management service fees 13 8 5 63 % Other advisory service fees  14 (14 ) (100 )% Other miscellaneous revenue 16 21 (5 ) (24 )% Total other revenue $ 98 $ 145 $ (47 ) (32 )% Other revenue of $98 million for the year ended December31, 2008 decreased $47 million, or 32%, compared to the year ended December31, 2007.
The decrease in other revenue of $47 million for the year ended December31, 2008, as compared to the year ended December31, 2007, was primarily the result of a decrease in fees earned for fund accounting services of $16 million, a $14 million decline in other advisory service fees earned in 2007, a $11 million decline in unit trust and class A mutual fund commissions revenue and a $6 million decline in property management fees primarily related to the termination in the fourth quarter of 2008 of certain Metric contracts with BlackRock real estate clients. Certain Metric employees have been transferred to a third party, which provides real estate clients the property management services formerly provided by Metric. At December31, 2008, Metric had no remaining employees. The decreases discussed above were offset by a $5 million increase in fees for transition management services.

Total GAAP expenses decreased $80 million, or 2%, to $3,471 million for the year ended December31, 2008, compared to $3,551 million for the year ended December31, 2007. Excluding certain items deemed non-recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not affect the Companys book value, total expenses, as adjusted, increased $75 million, or 2%. The increase was attributable to increases in distribution and servicing costs, employee compensation and benefits, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions and amortization of intangible assets.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $48 million, or 3%, to $1,815 million at December31, 2008, compared to $1,767 million for the year ended December31, 2007. The increase in employee compensation and benefits expense was primarily attributable to a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits offset by a $38 million decrease in deferred compensation, which was primarily linked to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans. The increase of $91 million in salaries and benefits was primarily due to an increase in headcount throughout the majority of 2007 and 2008 (including the effect associated with the fund of funds acquisition in 2007). Full time employees at December31, 2008 totaled 5,341 (including the effect of a reduction in force in the fourth quarter) as compared to 5,952 (including Metric) at December31, 2007. The decline in deferred compensation of $38 million was substantially offset by the change in valuations of investments set aside for these plans, which are included in non-operating income (expense).
Distribution and Servicing Costs Distribution and servicing costs increased $52 million, or 10%, to $591 million during the year ended December31, 2008, compared to $539 million for the year ended December31, 2007. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $52 million increase related primarily to higher levels of average AUM in cash management products.
Distribution and servicing costs for the year ended December31, 2008 included $464 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $30 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $444 million and $28 million, respectively, in the year ended December31, 2007. The increased costs attributable to Merrill Lynch was offset by approximately $10 million expense reduction associated with the 2007 termination of closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements. Distribution and servicing costs related to other non-related third parties increased $30 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms.
Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $22 million to $130 million for the year ended December31, 2008, as compared to $108 million for the year ended December31, 2007. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007 as well as higher sales and redemptions in certain share classes of open-ended funds.
Direct Fund Expenses Direct fund expenses increased $6 million, or 8%, to $86 million during the year ended December31, 2008 compared to $80 million for the year ended December31, 2007.

Other general and administration costs decreased $80 million, or 49%, to $83 million from $163 million, primarily related to a $49 million decrease in foreign currency remeasurement costs and $26 million decrease in costs associated with the support of two enhanced cash funds. Closed-end funds launch costs decreased $27 million as compared to the year ended December31, 2007 due to three closed-end funds launched during the year ended December31, 2007, which generated approximately $3.0 billion in AUM as compared to two closed-end funds launched in the year ended December31, 2008, which generated approximately $400 million in AUM. Professional services decreased $18 million, or 19%, to $76 million compared to $94 million for the year ended December31, 2007 primarily due to decreases in accounting, tax and other consulting costs related to the MLIM integration in 2007. Marketing and promotional expenses decreased $15 million, or 9%, primarily due to a decline in travel and promotional expenses. The decreases discussed above were partially offset by a $9 million, or 7%, increase in occupancy expenses to $139 million compared to $130 million for the year ended December31, 2007 as a result of expansion of offices worldwide (including the full-year effect of the Quellos Transaction).
Restructuring Charges For the year ended December31, 2008, BlackRock recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $38million, primarily related to severance, outplacement costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a 9% reduction in work force. See Restructuring charges discussion in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.

Amortization of Intangible Assets The $16 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $146 million for the year ended December31, 2008, compared to $130 million for the year ended December31, 2007, primarily reflects the full-year impact of the amortization of finite-lived intangible assets acquired in the Quellos Transaction.

2 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program.
3 Includes non-controlling interests related to operating entities (non-investment activities).
Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $422 million of expense for the year ended December31, 2008, as compared to non-operating income, less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests of $162 million for the year ended December31, 2007. The decrease in net non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co-investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year effect of the $700 million issuance of long-term debt in September 2007.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December31, 2007 (continued) Income Tax Expense Income tax expense was $387 million and $463 million for the years ended December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one-time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes.
Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December31, 2007. The Companys operating margin was 31.5% for the year ended December31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December31, 2008 included a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December31, 2007 included to the termination of certain closed-end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs.
As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December31, 2007 is primarily related to $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction.

Liquidity and Capital Resources BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for its cash flow presented in accordance with GAAP.

In addition, in December 2009 subsequent to the close of the BGI Transaction, there was an operating cash outflow of $356 million related to the payment of certain accrued BGI employee compensation assumed by BlackRock, which was funded by cash and investments acquired in connection with the BGI Transaction.
Investing Activities Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December31, 2009 primarily included a $5.6 billion outflow, net of $1,055 million of cash acquired related to the BGI Transaction, a $156 million contingent consideration payment to Quellos paid in the second quarter, $73 million of purchases of investments and $65 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $260 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and $89 million of return of capital from equity method investees.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Resources The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December31, 2009 and 2008 were as follows: December31, 2009 December31, 2008 Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) Amount % Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,708 $ 2,032 $ 2,676 132 % Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds 1 (75 ) (61 ) (14 ) (23 )% Subtotal 4,633 1,971 2,662 135 % 2007 credit facility  undrawn 2 2,171 2,171   % Commercial paper 3 (2,034 )  (2,034 ) NM Committed access before required regulatory capital $ 4,770 $ 4,142 $ 628 15 % Required regulatory capital 4 $ 857 $ 172 $ 685 398 % 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities.
2 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December31, 2009 and 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc.
3 The outstanding commercial paper notes that are supported by the 2007 credit facility reduce the availability of the facility.
4 A portion of the required regulatory capital is partially met with cash and cash equivalents.
In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $844 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash.
Short-term Borrowings 2007 Facility In August 2007, the Company entered into a five-year, $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility). The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December31, 2009. At December31, 2009, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.44% and a maturity date during February 2010. During February 2010, the Company rolled over $100 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.43% and a maturity date in May 2010. Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. Bank of America, a related party, has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short-term Borrowings (continued) Commercial Paper Program On October14, 2009, BlackRock established a commercial paper program (the CP Program) under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the CP Notes) on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3 billion. The proceeds of the commercial paper issuances were used to finance a portion of the BGI Transaction. Subsidiaries of Bank of America and Barclays, both related parties, as well as other third parties, act as dealers under the CP Program. At year-end the CP Program was supported by the 2007 facility.
The Company began to issue CP Notes under the CP Program on November4, 2009. As of December31, 2009, BlackRock had approximately $2 billion of outstanding CP Notes with a weighted average interest rate of 0.20% and a weighted average maturity of 23 days. Since December31, 2009, the Company repaid approximately $1.4 billion of CP Notes with proceeds from the long-term note issuances in December 2009 and operating cash flow. See Note 13, Borrowings, in the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion. As of March5, 2010, BlackRock had $596 million of outstanding CP Notes supported by the 2007 facility with a weighted average interest rate of 0.18% and a weighted average maturity of 38 days. The Company expects that the outstanding balance of CP Notes may fluctuate throughout the year.
Japan Commitment-line In June 2009, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, renewed its five billion Japanese yen commitment-line agreement (the Japan Commitment-line) for a term of one year.The Japan Commitment-line is intended to provide liquidity and flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December31, 2009, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment-line.
Conversion of Convertible Debentures On February15, 2009, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holder into cash and shares of the Companys common stock at any time prior to maturity. During 2009, holders of $7 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. In addition, during January and February 2010, holders of $148 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares.
Other Cash Uses As certain acquired BGI receivables are collected during 2010, it is anticipated that the Company will pay Barclays approximately $190 million to settle certain non-interest bearing notes assumed in the BGI Transaction.
In addition, BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, National Association (BTC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, expects to purchase approximately $300 million of additional Federal Reserve Bank stock during the first quarter of 2010 pursuant to its regulatory requirements.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two enhanced cash funds backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in 2009 both capital support agreements were terminated, due to the closure of the related funds. BlackRock provided approximately $4 million of capital contributions to these funds for the year ended December31, 2009 under the capital support agreements.
BlackRock holds debt securities it received in lieu of its remaining investment in one fund and securities it directly purchased from both enhanced cash funds prior to closure of the funds in 2009. At December31, 2009, the carrying value of the remaining debt securities was $12 million.
In applying the provisions of ASC 810-10, Consolidation (ASC 810-10), BlackRock concluded that it was the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds at December31, 2008, which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statements of financial condition.
Barclays Support of Certain Securities Lending Related Cash Funds Barclays has provided capital support agreements to support certain securities lending related cash management products acquired by BlackRock in the BGI Transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the capital support agreements, Barclays agreed to cover losses on covered securities within the products in the aggregate of up to $2.2 billion from December1, 2009 through December1, 2013. BlackRock and Barclays have procedures in place to determine loss events on covered securities within the products and to ensure support payments from Barclays. As of February 2010, Barclays remaining maximum potential obligation in the aggregate under the capital support agreements was $2.2 billion. At December31, 2009, BlackRock concluded that although these funds were variable interest entities, it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds.
Capital Activities On August2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December31, 2007 and the Company did not repurchase any additional shares under the program during 2008 and 2009. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program.
Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalents in those jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
BTC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is chartered as a national bank that does not accept client deposits and whose powers are limited to trust activities. BTC provides investment management services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services to institutional investors and other clients. BTC is subject to various regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by Federal banking agencies.
At December31, 2009, the Company was required to maintain approximately $857 million in net capital at these subsidiaries, including BTC, and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements .

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
In January 2010, the Company entered into an agreement for a lease in London which began in February 2010 and will continue for twenty-five years, with the option to renew for an additional five-year term. The lease provides for total annual base rental payments of approximately $22 million, which is subject to increase on each fifth anniversary of the beginning of the lease.
Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts, which are either non-cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December31, 2009, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December31, 2009.
Investment/Loan Commitments At December31, 2009, the Company had $311 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third party funds as third party non-controlling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December31, 2009. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
At December31, 2009, the Company was committed to provide financing of up to $60 million, until March 2010, to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in a real estate debt investment fund, which is also managed by BlackRock. At December31, 2009, $33.5 million of financing was outstanding and remains outstanding as of March10, 2010, which is past its final maturity date of March5, 2010. At December31, 2009, the value of the collateral was estimated to be $12.5 million, which resulted in a $21million reduction in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition and an equal amount recorded in general and administration expense in the year ended December31, 2009. The Company has no obligation to lend additional amounts to Anthracite under this facility. The Company continues to evaluate the collectability of the outstanding borrowings by reviewing the carrying value of the net assets of the collateral, which fluctuates each period.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements.
Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an amended and restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch, which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in certain BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three-year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimated payments for 2010, which due to uncertainty of asset levels and future additional sales, has been held constant for 2011 through 2013.
Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife was entitled to receive an additional payment of $9 million, which is expected to be paid in March 2010, based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos is entitled to receive two contingent payments, subject to achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock.
During second quarter 2009, the Company determined the amount of the first contingent payment to be $219 million, of which $11 million was previously paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $208 million, during second quarter 2009, $156 million was paid in cash and $52 million was paid in common stock, or approximately 330,000 shares based on a price of $157.33 per share.
The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch-up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 as the value of the first contingent payment was less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including the continued employment of certain employees with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation.
The contractual obligation table above includes both the maximum potential remaining payment of $155 million related to the catch up payment associated with the first contingent payment and $595 million related to the second contingent payment.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 15 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December31, 2009 totaled $1,482 million and included incentive compensation of $1,132 million, including $481 million related to BGI, deferred compensation of $112 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $238 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2010, while the deferred compensation obligations are payable over periods up to five years.
Separate Account Liabilities The Companys two wholly-owned registered life insurance companies in the United Kingdom maintain separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owners and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December31, 2009, the Company had $119.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the BGI, MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December31, 2009. See further discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.
88 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies as well as recent accounting developments. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.
Consolidation The accounting method used for the Companys investments is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements.
Pursuant to ASC 810-10, for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests.
Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, together with its related party relationships, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes.
89 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Consolidation (continued) As of December31, 2009, the Company was the primary beneficiary of one VIE, a private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the fund on its consolidated financial statements.
The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to ASC 810-20, Control of Partnerships and Similar Entities (ASC 810-20), the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non-affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have other substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements.
At December31, 2009 and 2008, as a result of consolidation of various investment products under the consolidation policies described above, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December31, 2009 December31, 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 75 $ 61 Investments 463 728 Other net assets (liabilities) (7 ) 12 Non-controlling interests (273 ) (491 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 258 $ 310 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to ASC 810-10.
Investments Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity.
90 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments (continued) Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non-operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be connected to BlackRocks core business.
At December31, 2009, the Company had $405 million and $36 million of equity method investments, including equity method investments held for deferred compensation, reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December31, 2008 the Company had $531 million and $14 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively.
Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income.
When the fair value of an available-for-sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other-than-temporary.
In making this determination for equity securities, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income.
In making this determination for debt securities, the Company considers if it: (1)has the intent to sell the security, (2)is more likely than not that an entity will be required to sell the security before recovery, or (3)does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security, but the security has suffered a credit loss, the impairment charge will be separated into the credit loss component, which would be recorded in earnings, and the remaining portion would be recorded in other comprehensive income.
91 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded other-than-temporary impairments of $5 million, including $2 million related to credit loss impairments on debt securities, $8 million and $16 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available-for-sale investments, which were recorded in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income.
The $2 million credit loss impairment in 2009 was determined by comparing the estimated discounted cash flows versus the amortized cost for each individual security. The other-than-temporary impairments related to debt securities were due to adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses.
Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income.
Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted the applicable provisions of ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820-10), as of January1, 2008, which require, among other things, enhanced disclosures about assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value. The provisions of ASC 820-10 establish a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities.
Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds and equities.
Level 2 Inputs - Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets that generally are included in this category may include debt securities, short-term floating rate notes and asset-backed securities, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, restricted public securities valued at a discount, as well as over-the-counter derivatives, including interest and inflation rate swaps and foreign exchange currency contracts that have inputs to the valuations that can be generally corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3 Inputs - Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability, which may include non-binding broker quotes. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds, direct private equity investments held within consolidated funds and certain held for sale real estate disposal assets.
92 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) Level 3 inputs include BlackRock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments. BlackRocks $687 million of Level 3 investments at December31, 2009 primarily include co-investments in private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities and real estate equity products. Many of these investees are investment companies, which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model-based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments.
The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument.
During the year ended December31, 2009, the Company reclassified approximately $22 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to an equity method investment, for which the Company determined that the capital account of the investment fund no longer represented fair value as determined under fair value methodologies.
Changes in value on approximately $932 million of investments will impact the Companys non-operating income (expense), approximately $73 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income and the $44 million remainder are not held at fair value. As of December31, 2009, changes in fair value of approximately $463 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non-controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $258 million.
BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances, which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

In accordance with GAAP, certain equity method investees do not account for both their financial assets and financial liabilities under fair value measures, therefore the Companys investment in such equity method investees may not represent fair value.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December31, 2009, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December31, 2009 Goodwill $ 12,570 Intangible assets Indefinitelived Management contracts 15,163 Trade names/trademarks 1,403 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization Management contracts 1,077 Other 5 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 30,218 94 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts acquired in a business acquisition to manage assets in proprietary open- and closed-end investment funds as well as common trust funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with the applicable provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (ASC 350), indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite-lived management contracts are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December31, 2009, ranged from 4 years to 15 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.2 years.
Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July31, 2009 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December31, 2009 the Companys common stock closed at $232.20, which exceeded its book value of approximately $128.86 per share.
Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite-lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite-life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite-lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist, which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined.
Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables, which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2009, 2008 and 2007 the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment.
In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $147 million, $146 million and $130 million for the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
95 Table of Contents Item7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
BlackRock adopted the applicable provisions of ASC 740 on January1, 2007 related to uncertainties in income taxes. ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on, among other things, de-recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.
The application of ASC 740 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December31, 2009, BlackRock had $285 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $184 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
In accordance with ASC 740, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December31, 2009, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $23 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $5,526 million on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. ASC 740 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.
As of December31, 2009, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $163 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain equity method investments which include fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for further details.
Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $271 million and current income taxes payable of $96 million at December31, 2009.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions.
The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non-U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with ASC 605-45, Revenue Recognition  Principle Agent Considerations (ASC 605-45), and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $611 million, $762 million and $780 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties, which due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as distribution and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income.
The Company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. Such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash and securities, ranging from 102% to 108% of the value of the loaned securities. The net income earned on the collateral is shared between the Company and the funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. For the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, securities lending revenue totaled $36 million, $25 million and $27 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services are often agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee.
The Company may also receive performance fees or incentive allocations from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts which are primarily alternative, equity or multi-asset class products. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement periods, which vary by product or account and could be monthly, quarterly, annually or longer. For the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, performance fee revenue totaled $202 million, $177 million and $350 million, respectively.
In addition, the Company may receive carried interest in the form of an investment capital allocation or cash from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. However, BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon performance of these investment products in future periods. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw-back provisions as performance fees on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had $13 million and $21 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The ultimate recognition of revenue, if any, for these products is unknown.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions , which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i)fixed fees, (ii)percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii)performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $477 million, $393 million and $190 million, respectively.
Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw-back of carried interest is mathematically improbable.
Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December31, 2009, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees.
Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval.
In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments.
BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity and hedge funds. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December31, 2009, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $36 million.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks At December31, 2009, approximately $463 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Excluding the impact of investments made to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans and certain equity investments that are hedged via the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December31, 2009 December31, 2008 Variance Amount % Total investments, GAAP $ 1,049 $ 1,429 $ (380 ) (27 )% Investments held by consolidated sponsored investment funds (463 ) (728 ) 265 36 % Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 258 310 (52 ) (17 )% Total net economic investments 844 1,011 (167 ) (17 )% Deferred compensation investments (71 ) (59 ) (12 ) (20 )% Hedged investments (36 ) (49 ) 13 27 % Total net economic investment exposure $ 737 $ 903 $ (166 ) (18 )% The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December31, 2009, the Companys net exposure to market price risk in its investment portfolio was approximately $455 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include public equity and real estate investments as well as certain hedge funds. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $45.5 million in the carrying value of such investments.
Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December31, 2009, the Company was exposed to interest-rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $282 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5 million in the carrying value of such investments.
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound sterling, Korean won and Australian dollars, was $89 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9 million decline in the carrying value of such investments.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE There have been no disagreements on accounting and financial disclosure matters. BlackRock has not changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years.
Item9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the direction of BlackRocks Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, BlackRock evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d - 15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, BlackRocks Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that BlackRocks disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Internal Control and Financial Reporting Other than the integration of certain information technology systems and processes of the acquired BGI business to those of BlackRock, there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the latest fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, such internal control over financial reporting. Certain controls of the BGI business have been excluded from Managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December31, 2009, in accordance with SEC guidance on the exclusion of an acquired business from a companys internal control over financial reporting. BlackRock is continuing to evaluate its internal controls as well as the internal controls of the acquired BGI business as BlackRock integrates the BGI business into the existing BlackRock business.
101 Table of Contents Item9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (continued) Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of BlackRock, Inc. (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with the authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2009. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework .
On December1, 2009, BlackRock acquired Barclays Global Investors business (BGI). Managements assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include a review of certain business process controls of BGI, which are relevant to the Companys 2009 consolidated financial statements. Management did not assess certain aspects of BGIs internal control over financial reporting as SEC guidelines permit excluding an acquired business from such assessment when those acquisitions closed within the year prior to the date of the financial statements and time does not permit such assessment. The aspects of BGIs internal control over financial reporting that were not assessed represent approximately 12% of total assets at December31, 2009 and approximately 7% of revenues for the year ended December31, 2009.
Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December31, 2009, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective.
The Companys independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. This report begins on page 103.
March10, 2010 102 Table of Contents Item9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (continued) REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BlackRock, Inc.: We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of BlackRock, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment certain aspects of the internal control over financial reporting of the Barclays Global Investors business, which was acquired on December1, 2009 and whose financial statements constitute 12% of total assets and 7% of revenues of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December31, 2009. Accordingly, our audit did not include certain aspects of the internal control over financial reporting of the Barclays Global Investors business. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2009, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statement of financial condition as of December31, 2009 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the year then ended of the Company and our report dated March10, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BlackRock, Inc. and subsidiaries at December31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March10, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Introduction and Basis of Presentation Business BlackRock, Inc. (together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, BlackRock or the Company) provides diversified investment management and securities lending services to institutional clients and to individual investors through various investment vehicles. Investment management services primarily consist of the management of fixed income, cash management and equity client accounts, the management of a number of open-end and closed-end mutual fund families, exchange traded funds and other non-U.S. equivalent retail products serving the institutional and retail markets, and the management of other investments funds, including common trusts and alternative funds, developed to serve various customer needs.

On October1, 2007, BlackRock acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the fund of funds business of Quellos Group, LLC (Quellos) for up to $1,719 million (the Quellos Transaction). BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and issued 1,191,785 shares of BlackRock common stock valued at $188 million. The common stock which is held in escrow for up to three years is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. The Quellos business was combined with the existing BlackRock fund of funds business and the combined platform comprises one of the largest fund of funds platforms in the world.
On January1, 2009, Bank of America (Bank of America) acquired Merrill Lynch& Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch). In connection with this transaction, BlackRock entered into exchange agreements with each of Merrill Lynch andThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) pursuant to which on February27, 2009 Merrill Lynch and PNC each exchanged a portion of its BlackRock common stock it held for an equal number of shares of non-voting preferred stock.See Note 19, Capital Stock, for more details on these transactions.
On December1, 2009, BlackRock completed its acquisition of Barclays Global Investors (BGI) from Barclays Bank PLC (Barclays) (the BGI Transaction). In exchange for BGI, BlackRock paid approximately $6.65 billion in cash and issued capital stock valued at $8.53 billion comprised of 3,031,516 shares of BlackRock common stock, 26,888,001 shares of BlackRock Series B Participating Preferred Stock and 7,647,254 shares of BlackRock Series D Participating Preferred Stock to Barclays. See Note 3, Mergers and Acquisitions, for more details on this transaction.
On December31, 2009, equity ownership of BlackRock was as follows: Voting CommonStock CapitalStock Bank of America/Merrill Lynch 3.7 % 34.2 % PNC 35.2 % 24.5 % Barclays 4.8 % 19.8 % Other 56.3 % 21.5 % 100.0 % 100.0 % F-11 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and include the accounts of the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Non-controlling interests include the portion of consolidated sponsored investment funds in which the Company does not have a direct equity ownership. Significant accounts and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
2. Significant Accounting Policies Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents primarily consists of cash, money market funds and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities, at date of purchase, of three months or less in which the Company is exposed to market and credit risk. Cash and cash equivalent balances that are legally restricted from use by the Company are recorded in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Cash balances maintained by consolidated sponsored investment funds are not considered legally restricted and are included in cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
Investments Investments in Debt and Marketable Equity Securities BlackRock holds debt and marketable equity investments which, pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 320-10, Investments  Debt and Equity Securities, are classified as trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity based on the Companys intent to sell the security or, for a debt security, the Companys intent and ability to hold the debt security to maturity.
Trading securities are those investments which are purchased principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non-operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change.
Available-for-sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities or held-to-maturity. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available-for-sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non-operating income on the Companys consolidated statements of income.
Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition.
F-12 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where it is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE), but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company follows the equity method of accounting in accordance with ASC 323, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures . Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss on investment funds is recorded as net gain (loss) on investments within non-operating income (expense) and as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be connected to BlackRocks core business. The net income of the investee is recorded based upon the most current information available at the time, which may precede the date of the statement of financial condition. Distributions received from the investment reduce the Companys investment balance.
Cost Method For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non-marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received from the investment are recorded as dividend income within non-operating income.
Impairments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available-for-sale and cost method of accounting investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using fair values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded in non-operating income in the consolidated statements of income.
When the fair value of available-for-sale securities is lower than its cost, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary.
In making this determination, for equity securities, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in non-operating income in the consolidated statements of income.
F-13 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Impairments (continued) In making this determination for debt securities, the Company considers if it: (1)has the intent to sell the security, (2)is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, or (3)does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security, but the security has suffered a credit loss, the impairment charge is be separated into the credit loss component, which is recorded in earnings, and the remaining portion is recorded in other comprehensive income.
The Company reviews its collateralized debt obligations (CDO) investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary. The impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value.
Consolidation The accounting method used for the Companys equity investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock, together with its related party relationships, is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The primary beneficiary determination will consider not only BlackRocks equity interest, but the benefits and risks associated with non-equity components of the Companys relationship with the investee, including capital support agreements, debt, investment advisory and other similar arrangements, in accordance with ASC 810-10, Consolidation (ASC 810-10).
Pursuant to ASC 810-20, Control of Partnerships and Similar Entities (810-20) , the Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, generally is presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies that are not deemed to be VIEs. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if third party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have other substantive participating rights.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Consolidation (continued) Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds From time to time, the Company will maintain a controlling interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the underlying investments held by consolidated sponsored investment funds are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the investments fair values reflected in non-operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for such underlying investments are estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the funds net asset value. When the Company no longer controls these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another investment accounting method. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies and certain real estate products, are recorded based upon the most current information available at the time, which may precede the date of the statement of financial position, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment.
Upon consolidation of various sponsored investment funds, on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition, the Company retains the specialized accounting principles of the underlying funds pursuant to ASC 810-10 .
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities Two wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company in the United Kingdom are registered life insurance companies that maintain separate accounts representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The separate account assets are not subject to general claims of the creditors of BlackRock. These accounts and the related liabilities are recorded as separate account assets and separate account liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition in accordance with the ASC 944-80, Financial Services  Separate Accounts.
The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to separate account assets supporting individual and group pension contracts accrue directly to the contract owner and are not reported as revenue or non-operating income in the consolidated statements of income. Policy administration and management fees associated with separate account products are included in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue in the consolidated statements of income.
Collateral Assets Held and Liabilities Under Securities Lending Agreements The Company facilitates securities lending arrangements whereby securities held by separate account assets discussed above are lent to third parties. In exchange, the Company receives collateral, principally cash and securities, ranging from 102% to 108% of the value of the securities lent in order to reduce credit risk. Under the Companys securities lending arrangements, the Company can resell or re-pledge the collateral and the borrower can re-sell or re-pledge the loaned securities. The securities lending transactions entered into by the Company are accompanied by an agreement that entitles and obligates the Company to repurchase or redeem the transferred securities before their maturity. These transactions are not reported as sales under ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing (ASC 860) because of the obligation of the Company to repurchase the securities.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Collateral Assets Held and Liabilities Under Securities Lending Agreements (continued) As a result, the Company records the collateral received under these arrangements (both cash and non-cash), as its own asset in addition to a corresponding liability for the obligation to return the collateral. As with the securities lending collateral discussed above, the fair value of the asset and related obligation to return the collateral are recorded by the Company. At December 31, 2009, the fair value of loaned securities held by separate account assets was approximately $18 billion and the collateral held under these securities lending agreements was approximately $19.3 billion. The fair value of the collateral liability approximates the fair value of the collateral assets and is recorded in collateral liability under securities lending agreements on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions The Company holds the rights to receive certain cash flows from sponsored mutual funds sold without a front-end sales charge (back-end load shares). The carrying value of these deferred mutual fund commissions is being amortized over periods between one and six years. The Company receives distribution fees from these funds and contingent deferred sales commissions (CDSCs) upon shareholder redemption of certain back-end load shares which are recorded within distribution fees on the consolidated statements of income. Upon receipt of CDSCs, the Company records revenue and the remaining unamortized deferred sales commission is expensed.
In April 2007, the Company acquired from a subsidiary of PNC certain distribution financing arrangements to receive certain cash flows from sponsored open-ended mutual funds sold without a front-end sales charge. The fair value of these capitalized assets is amortized over periods up to six years. The Company also acquired the rights to related distribution fees from these funds and CDSCs upon shareholder redemption of certain back-end load shares prior to the end of the contingent deferred sales period. The Company paid $34 million in exchange for the above rights, which is reflected on the consolidated statement of cash flows as an acquisition within investing activities.
The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of deferred mutual fund commission assets to determine whether a significant decline in the equity or bond markets or other events or circumstances indicate that an impairment in value may have occurred. If indicators of a potential impairment exist, the Company compares the carrying value of the asset to the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows related to the asset. If such assessments indicate that estimated future net undiscounted cash flows will not be sufficient to recover the recorded carrying value, the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value. No such impairments were recorded for the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 or 2007.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation generally is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining lease term.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Property and Equipment (continued) Software Costs BlackRock develops a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services for internal use, utilizing proprietary software which is hosted and maintained by BlackRock. The Company follows ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software (ASC 350-40) .
ASC 350-40 requires the capitalization of certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are included within property and equipment on the consolidated statements of financial condition and are amortized beginning when the software project is complete and put into production, over the estimated useful life of the software of three years.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill which represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired includes assembled workforce. Intangible assets are comprised of indefinite-lived intangible assets and finite-lived intangible assets. The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open-end funds, closed-end funds and collective funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. In addition, trade-names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (ASC 350), indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. The value of contracts for separately managed accounts and certain alternative funds which have finite lives are amortized over the expected life of the contracts.
The Company assesses its goodwill, indefinite-lived management contracts and trade names/trademarks and finite-lived management contracts for impairment at least annually. In its assessment of goodwill for impairment, the Company considers such factors as the book value and market capitalization of the Company. In its assessment of indefinite-lived management contracts and trade names/trademarks, the Company considers such factors as assets under management, product mix, product margins and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite-life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite-lived management contracts and their remaining useful life is reviewed at least annually to determine if circumstances exist which may indicate a potential impairment. In addition, if circumstances exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined.
Change in Method of Applying an Accounting Principle During 2007, the Company changed the date of its annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets to July31 st in order to provide additional time for testing due to the significant increase in these assets as a result of recent acquisitions. The Companys management believes that this change in the method of applying an accounting principle is preferable under the circumstances and does not result in adjustments to the Companys consolidated financial statements when applied retrospectively, nor would it result in the delay, acceleration or avoidance of recording a potential future impairment. This change in the method of applying ASC 350 had no impact on the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December31, 2007.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Change in Method of Applying an Accounting Principle (continued) The impairment tests performed as of July31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 indicated that no impairment charges were required. Due to the capital market events that occurred in 2007 and 2008, the Company performed an additional impairment test as of September30, 2008 which also indicated no impairment charges were required.
Assets and Liabilities to be Disposed of by Sale In the course of the business of establishing real estate and other alternative investment funds, the Company may purchase land, properties and other assets while incurring liabilities directly associated with the assets, together a disposal group, with the intention to sell the disposal group to sponsored investment funds upon their launch. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment (ASC 360-10) , the Company treats these assets and liabilities as a disposal group, measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value. Losses are recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down to fair value and gains are recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value, but not in excess of the cumulative loss previously recognized.
At December31, 2009 and 2008, the Company held disposal group assets of $46 million and $64 million in other assets and related disposal group liabilities of $45 million and $63 million of other liabilities, respectively, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. At December31, 2009 and 2008, disposal group liabilities included approximately $42 million and $58 million of borrowings directly associated with the disposal group assets, respectively. During the year ended December31, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded a net loss of $2 million and $14 million, respectively, within non-operating income (expense) on its consolidated statements of income related to the disposal group, respectively.
Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities The provisions of ASC 480-10, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (ASC 480-10), require temporary equity classification for instruments that are currently redeemable or convertible for cash or other assets at the option of the holder. At December31, 2009 and 2008, the Company determined that $49 million and $266 million, respectively, of non-controlling interests related to certain consolidated sponsored investment funds were redeemable at the option of the holder for cash or other assets, resulting in temporary equity classification on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
The amount of temporary equity related to convertible instruments is measured as the excess of the amount of cash required to be exchanged in a hypothetical settlement, as of the balance sheet date, over the current carrying amount of the liability component. During the year ended December31, 2009, the 2.625% convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock. The amount of cash required to be paid out in a hypothetical settlement exceeded the current carrying amount of the liability component by less than $1 million.
Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests on the consolidated statements of income includes the income/(loss) allocated to non-controlling interest holders of the Companys consolidated sponsored investment funds. Non-controlling interests are not adjusted for taxes for consolidated sponsored investment funds that are treated as pass-through entities for tax purposes.

At the date of subsequent reissuance, the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of such stock on the average cost method.
Revenue Recognition Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of the assets under management (AUM) or, in the case of certain real estate clients, net operating income generated by the underlying properties. Investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions.
The Company contracts with third parties and related parties for various mutual fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with ASC 605-45, Revenue Recognition  Principal Agent Considerations (ASC 605-45) and has recorded its management fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $611 million, $762 million and $780 million, respectively, and were reflected net in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income.
The Company also earns securities lending revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. Such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis. The net income earned on the collateral is shared between the Company and funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed.
Performance Fees The Company also receives performance fees or an incentive allocation from alternative investment products and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which varies by product or account.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) Performance Fees (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investments upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw-back provisions as performance fees on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had $13 million and $21 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock provides a variety of market risk management, investment analytic, enterprise investment system and financial markets advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions  and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation of illiquid securities, disposition and workouts, strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing for clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i)fixed fees, (ii)percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM and (iii)performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. The fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are recorded in BlackRock Solutions and advisory on the consolidated statements of income.
Other Revenue The Company earns fees for transition management services comprised of referral fees or agency commissions from acting as an introducing broker-dealer in buying and selling securities on behalf of the Companys customers. Commissions and related clearing expenses related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur and are reflected in other revenue on the consolidated statements of income.
The Company also earns commissions revenue upon the sale of unit trusts and ClassA mutual funds. Revenue is recorded at the time of the sale of the product.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Stock-based Compensation The Company applies the requirements within ASC 718-10, Compensation  Stock Compensation (ASC 718-10) which establish standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, primarily focusing on the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. Entities are required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service (usually the vesting period) in exchange for the stock award.
The Company measures the grant-date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments using option-pricing models. If an equity award is modified after the grant date, incremental compensation cost is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification. The grant-date fair value of restricted stock units is calculated using the Companys share price on the date of grant. Compensation cost is recorded by the Company on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award is, in-substance, multiple awards. Awards under the Companys stock-based compensation plans vest over periods ranging from one to five years. Compensation cost is reduced by the number of awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting. Forfeiture estimates generally are derived using historical forfeiture information, where available, and are reviewed for reasonableness at least annually.
The Company amortizes the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation awards made to retirement eligible employees over the required service period. Upon notification of retirement, the Company accelerates the unamortized portion of the award over the contractually-required retirement notification period, if applicable.
The Company pays cash dividend equivalents, that are not subject to vesting, on outstanding restricted stock units (RSUs) granted prior to 2009. ASC 718-10 requires dividend equivalents on RSUs expected to be forfeited to be included in compensation and benefits expense. Dividend equivalents on shares expected to vest are recorded in retained earnings.
Distribution and Servicing Costs Distribution and servicing costs include payments to third parties and affiliates, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Distribution and servicing costs are expensed when incurred.
Direct Fund Expenses Direct fund expenses, which are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of third party non-advisory expenses incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of certain index trademarks, reference data for certain indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, audit and tax services as well as other fund related expenses directly attributable to the non-advisory operations of the fund.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Leases The Company accounts for its operating leases, which may include escalations, in accordance with ASC 840-10, Leases . The Company expenses the lease payments associated with operating leases evenly during the lease term (including rent-free periods), beginning on the commencement of the lease term.
Foreign Exchange Monetary assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries having non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at exchange rates at the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition. Non-monetary assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries having non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders equity on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in general and administration expense on the consolidated statements of income. For the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded gains/(losses) from foreign currency transactions of ($11) million, $50 million and $1 million, respectively.
Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740-10, Income Taxes (ASC 740-10). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, taxable income in prior carryback years, future deductibility of the asset, changes in applicable tax laws and other factors. If management determines that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance will be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to income tax expense on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability.
BlackRock adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10 related to uncertainty in income taxes on January1, 2007. ASC 740-10 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements. ASC 740-10 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. ASC 740-10 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
Excess tax benefits and shortfalls related to stock-based compensation are recognized as additional paid in capital and subsequent to the adoption of ASC 740-10 excess tax benefits are reflected as financing cash flows on the consolidated statements of cash flows. If the Company does not have additional paid-in capital credits (cumulative tax benefits recorded to additional paid-in capital), the Company will record an expense for any deficit between the recorded tax benefit and tax return benefit. At December31, 2009, BlackRock had excess additional paid-in capital credits to absorb potential deficits between recorded tax benefits and tax return benefits.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Earnings per Share (EPS) As a result of the retrospective adoption of the new required provisions within ASC 260-10, Earnings per Share (ASC 260-10) , on January1, 2009, EPS is calculated pursuant to the two-class method as defined in ASC 260-10 .
See Accounting Policies Adopted in the Year Ended December31, 2009 below for further information. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS includes the determinants of basic EPS and, in addition, reflects the impact of other potentially dilutive shares.
Due to the similarities in terms between BlackRock series A, B, C and D non-voting participating preferred stock and the Companys common stock, the Company considers each series of non-voting participating preferred stock to be common stock equivalents for purposes of earnings per common share calculations.
In accordance with ASC 260-10, shares of the Companys common stock are not included in basic earnings per common share until contingencies are resolved and the shares are released. Shares of the Companys common stock are not included in diluted earnings per common share unless the contingency has been met assuming that the contingency period ended on the date of the consolidated statement of financial condition.
Business Segments The Companys management directs BlackRocks operations as one business, the asset management business. As such, the Company operates in one business segment as defined in ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting .
Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted the applicable provisions of ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820-10), as of January1, 2008, which require, among other things, enhanced disclosures about assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value. The provisions of ASC 820-10 establish a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities.
Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds and equities.
F-23 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) Level 2 Inputs  Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets that generally are included in this category may include debt securities, short-term floating rate notes and asset-backed securities, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, restricted public securities valued at a discount, as well as over the counter derivatives, including interest and inflation rate swaps and foreign exchange currency contracts that have inputs to the valuations that can be generally corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3 Inputs  Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability, which may include non-binding broker quotes. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds, direct private equity investments held within consolidated funds and certain held for sale real estate disposal assets.
Level 3 inputs include BlackRock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments, including distressed credit hedge funds, real estate and private equity funds which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices. The various partnerships are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally require the fund to utilize pricing/valuation information, including independent appraisals, from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model-based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments.
The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument.
Fair Value Option In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new guidance within ASC 825-10, Financial Instruments (ASC 825-10). The relevant provisions within ASC 825-10 permit entities to choose to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. The decision to elect the fair value option is determined on an instrument by instrument basis, must be applied to an entire instrument and it is irrevocable once elected. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value pursuant to ASC 825-10 are required to be reported separately in the statement of financial condition from those instruments measured using another accounting method. The Company adopted the applicable provisions of ASC 825-10 on January1, 2008; however, elected not to apply the fair value option to any of its eligible financial assets or liabilities at that date. Therefore, the adoption of the applicable provision of ASC 825-10 had no impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. As of December31, 2009, the Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial assets or liabilities; however, the Company may elect the fair value option for any future eligible financial assets or liabilities upon their initial recognition.
F-24 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Disclosure of Fair Value The disclosure requirements within ASC 825-10 require disclosure of estimated fair values of certain financial instruments, both on and off the consolidated statements of financial condition. For financial instruments recognized at fair value in the statement of financial position, the disclosure requirements of ASC 820-10 also apply.
The methods and assumptions are set forth below:  Cash and cash equivalents are carried at either cost or amortized cost which approximates fair value due to their short term maturities. Money market funds are valued through the use of quoted market prices, or $1, which is generally the net asset value of these funds.
The carrying amounts of receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to their short maturities.
The fair value of marketable investments is based on quoted market prices or broker quotes. If investments are not readily marketable, fair values are primarily determined based on net asset values of investments in limited partnerships/limited liability companies or by the Company based on managements assumptions or estimates, taking into consideration financial information of the investment, the industry of the investment, or valuation services from third party service providers. At December31, 2009, with the exception of certain equity method and cost method investments that are not accounted for under a fair value measure, the carrying value of investments approximated fair value. See Note 7, Fair Value Disclosures, for more information.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ASC 815-10, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815-10), establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivatives embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. ASC 815-10 generally requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition and to measure those investments at fair value.
The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purpose. The Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging (a)exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of certain assets and liabilities and (b)market exposures for certain investments. The Company may also use derivatives within separate account assets and liabilities which are segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts or in connection with capital support agreements with affiliated investment companies. In addition, certain consolidated sponsored investment funds may also invest in derivatives as a part of their investment strategy.
Changes in the fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments are recognized in current earnings and, where applicable, are offset by the corresponding gain or loss on the related foreign-denominated assets or liabilities or hedged investments, in the consolidated statements of income.
Reclassifications Certain items previously reported have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Recent Accounting Developments Accounting Policies Adopted in the Year Ended December31, 2009 Non-Controlling Interests In December 2007, the FASB issued new requirements within ASC 810-10, which established accounting and reporting standards for a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary and clarifies that a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity, separate from the parents equity, in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, consolidated net income should be adjusted to include the net income attributed to the non-controlling interests. The Company adopted the applicable guidance of ASC 810-10 on January1, 2009, which required retrospective adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing non-controlling interests. All other requirements of ASC 810-10 are applied prospectively. The adoption of the applicable provisions of ASC 810-10 did not impact BlackRocks stockholders equity on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
Convertible Debt Instruments In May 2008, the FASB issued new requirements within ASC 470-20, which specify that for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion, issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in the statement of financial condition. The excess of the initial proceeds of the convertible debt instrument over the amount allocated to the liability component creates a debt discount which should be amortized as interest expense over the expected life of the liability. The applicable provisions of ASC 470-20 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December15, 2008 and are to be applied retrospectively. At December31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had $243 million and $249 million principal amount of convertible debentures outstanding, respectively, which were issued in February 2005, bear interest at a rate of 2.625%, and are due in 2035. The Company retrospectively adopted the required paragraphs of ASC 470-20 on January1, 2009 resulting in a total cumulative impact of a $9 million reduction to retained earnings at December31, 2008. The effective borrowing rate for nonconvertible debt at the time of issuance of the 2.625% convertible debentures was estimated to be 4.3%, which resulted in $18 million of the $250 million aggregate principal amount of the debentures issued, or $12 million after tax, being attributable to equity. At December31, 2009 and 2008, less than $1 million and $4 million, respectively, of the initial $18 million debt discount remained unamortized, and was amortized to the first put date of the convertible debentures in February 2010. As a result, the Company recognized approximately $4 million and $3 million of additional interest expense in each of the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Accounting Policies Adopted in the Year Ended December31, 2009 (continued) Earnings Per Share In June 2008, the FASB issued new requirements within ASC 260-10, which specify that all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities and should be included in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class method as defined in ASC 260-10. The new requirements of ASC 260-10 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. All prior period EPS data presented must be adjusted retrospectively. Prior to 2009, the Company awarded restricted stock and restricted stock units with nonforfeitable dividend equivalent rights. Restricted stock and restricted stock units awarded in 2009 are not considered participating securities as dividend equivalents are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting of the award. The Company adopted the new requirements of ASC 260-10 on January1, 2009.
The impact of retrospective adoption of ASC 470-20 and ASC 260-10 to diluted EPS for common shares in 2007 and 2008 was a decline of $0.16 and $0.13, respectively.
Fair Value Measurements In February 2008, the FASB issued new guidance within ASC 820-10, which delayed the effective date of the application of ASC 820-10 to fiscal years beginning after November15, 2008 for all non-financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a non-recurring basis. Non-recurring non-financial assets and liabilities include goodwill, indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets each measured at fair value for purposes of impairment testing, asset retirement and guarantee obligations initially measured at fair value, and those assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination or asset purchase. The adoption of the provisions of ASC 820-10 on January1, 2009 for non-recurring non-financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
Fair Value Measurements Disclosures and Impairments of Securities In April2009, the FASB issued the following three provisions intended to provide additional application guidance and enhance disclosures regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities:  The new provisions issued within ASC 320-10, Investments  Debt and Equity Securities (ASC 320-10), amend current other-than-temporary impairment guidance in GAAP for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other-than-temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements. Under ASC 320-10, an other-than-temporary impairment for debt securities is triggered if (1)an entity has the intent to sell the security, (2)it is more likely than not that an entity will be required to sell the security before recovery, or (3)an entity does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If an entity does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security, but the security has suffered a credit loss, the impairment charge will be separated into the credit loss component, which is recorded in earnings, and the remaining portion is recorded in other comprehensive income. ASC 320-10 does not amend existing recognition and measurement guidance related to other-than-temporary impairments of equity securities.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Accounting Policies Adopted in the Year Ended December31, 2009 (continued) Fair Value Measurements Disclosures and Impairments of Securities: (continued)  The new provisions issued within ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820-10), provide additional guidance on determining when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased andincludes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly.
The new provisions issued within ASC 825-10, Financial Instruments (ASC 825-10), amend the existing disclosure guidance about fair value of financial instruments to expand the required qualitative and quantitative disclosures about fair value of financial instruments to interim reporting periods for publicly traded entities. In addition, the applicable guidance within ASC 825-10 amends ASC 270-10, Interim Reporting , to require those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods.
The adoption of all three of the above new provisions as of April1, 2009, did not materially impact the Companys consolidated financial statements.
Business Combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance within ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), and in April 2009, the FASB issued additional guidance within ASC 805 , Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise From Contingencies . ASC 805 retains the fundamental requirements that the acquisition method of accounting (the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. The new provisions within ASC 805 further define the acquirer, establish the acquisition date and broaden the scope of transactions that qualify as business combinations.
Additionally, the new requirements within ASC 805 change the fair value measurement provisions for assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, provide guidance for the measurement of fair value in a step acquisition, change the requirements for recognizing assets acquired and liabilities assumed subject to contingencies, provide guidance on recognition and measurement of contingent consideration and require that acquisition-related costs of the acquirer generally be expensed as incurred. Reversal of valuation allowances related to acquired deferred tax assets and changes to liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions assumed in business combinations that settled prior to the adoption of the new requirements within ASC 805 affected goodwill. If such valuation allowances reverse or liabilities change subsequent to the adoption of the new requirements within ASC 805, such changes will affect the income tax provision in the period of reversal or change.
The new requirements within ASC 805 apply prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2008. The Company adopted the new requirements within ASC 805 on January1, 2009. The adoption of the new requirements within ASC 805 impacted the Companys consolidated financial statements for the year ended December31, 2009 as the Company completed its acquisition of BGI during 2009 and certain acquisition related costs in connection with the BGI Transaction have been expensed as incurred. See Note 3, Mergers and Acquisitions, for further discussion.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Accounting Policies Adopted in the Year Ended December31, 2009 (continued) Useful Life of Intangible Assets In April 2008, the FASB issued additional guidance within ASC 350-30, General Intangibles Other than Goodwill (ASC 350-30). The required provisions within ASC 350-30 amend the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under the prior guidance within ASC 350 Intangibles  Goodwill and Other . ASC 350-30 requires that an entity shall consider its own experience in renewing similar arrangements. ASC 350-30 is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of an intangible asset determined under prior requirements within ASC 350 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under ASC 805 and other GAAP. The new requirements of ASC 350-30 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption on January1, 2009 of the new requirements within ASC 350-30 did not materially impact the Companys consolidated financial statements.
Disclosures about Derivative Instruments In March 2008, the FASB issued new guidance within ASC 815-10. ASC 815-10 expands the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. ASC 815-10 specifically requires enhanced disclosures addressing: (1)how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (2)how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under ASC 815 and its related interpretations and (3)how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. ASC 815-10 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November15, 2008. The adoption on January1, 2009 of the additional disclosure requirements of ASC 815-10 did not materially impact the Companys consolidated financial statements.
Meaning of Indexed to a Companys Own Stock In June 2008, the FASB issued new guidance within ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging: Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (ASC 815-40). The new requirements of ASC 815-40 provide guidance for determining whether an equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to an entitys own stock. To meet the definition of indexed to its own stock, an instruments contingent exercise provisions must not be based on an observable market other than the market for the issuers stock, and its settlement amount must be based only on those variables that are inputs to the fair value of a fixed-for-fixed forward or option on an entitys equity shares. The adoption on January1, 2009 of the required provisions of ASC 815-40 did not change the classification or measurement of the Companys financial instruments.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Accounting Policies Adopted in the Year Ended December31, 2009 (continued) Subsequent Events In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC 855-10, Subsequent Events (ASC 855-10), which provides guidance to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. ASC 855-10 is effective for interim or fiscal periods ending after June15, 2009. The Company adopted ASC 855-10 on June30, 2009. The adoption of ASC 855-10 did not materially impact the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In February 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-09, Subsequent Events (ASU 2010-09), effective immediately, which amends ASC 855-10 to clarify that an SEC filer is not required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in the financial statements. The adoption of ASU 2010-09 did not materially impact the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 25, Subsequent Events, for further discussion.
The FASB Accounting Standards Codification In June 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.2009-1, Amendments Based on SFAS No.168, The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  a replacement of FASB Statement No.162 (ASU 2009-1). ASU 2009-1 established the FASB ASC as the single source of authoritative GAAP to be applied by nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. All other accounting literature not included in the ASC will become nonauthoritative. ASU 2009-1 is effective for financial statements for interim or annual reporting periods ending after September15, 2009. The Company adopted ASU 2009-1 on September30, 2009. As ASU 2009-1 does not change GAAP, its adoption did not impact amounts recorded or disclosures required as part of the Companys consolidated financial statements.
Measuring Fair Value of Certain Alternative Investments In September 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-12, Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) (ASU 2009-12). ASU 2009-12 amends ASC 820-10 to provide guidance on measuring the fair value of certain alternative investments. The amendments in this ASU permit, as a practical expedient, a reporting entity to use the investments net asset value per share (NAV) to measure the fair value of the investment provided that the NAV is calculated as of the reporting entitys measurement date. ASU 2009-12 also requires enhanced disclosures by major investment category about the attributes of the investments within the scope, such as the nature of the restrictions, the amount of the unfunded commitments and the description of the investment strategies of the investees. ASU 2009-12 is effective for the interim and annual reporting periods ending after December15, 2009. In the period of adoption, an entity must disclose any change in valuation technique and related inputs and quantify the total effect, if practicable. The adoption of the additional disclosure requirements of ASU 2009-12, on December31, 2009, did not materially impact the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 7, Fair Value Disclosures for more information.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Recent Accounting Developments New Consolidation Guidance for Variable Interest Entities In June 2009, the FASB issued new requirements within ASC 810-10, which amend the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities under FIN 46(R). The amendments include: (1)the elimination of the exemption from consolidation for qualifying special purpose entities, (2)a new approach for determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE, which requires that the primary beneficiary have both (i)the power to control the most significant activities of the VIE and (ii)either the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE, and (3)the requirement to continually reassess the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
In February 2010 the FASB issued ASU 2010-10, Amendments to Statement 167 for Certain Investment Funds ( ASU 2010-10) .
The ASU will indefinitely defer the application of SFAS No.167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No.46(R) for a reporting enterprises interest in an entity if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the entity either has all of the attributes of an investment company, as specified in ASC 946-10, Financial Services-Investment Companies (ASC 946-10); (2)it is industry practice to apply measurement principles for financial reporting that are consistent with those in ASC 946-10; (3)the entity is not a securitization entity, an asset-backed financing entity, or an entity formerly considered a qualifying special-purpose entity, and (4)the reporting enterprise does not have an obligation to fund losses significant to the entity.
In addition, the deferral applies to a reporting entitys interest in an entity that is required to comply or operate in accordance with the requirement of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds.
The amendments in this ASU clarify that for entities that do not qualify for the proposed deferral, related parties should be considered when evaluating each of the criteria for determining whether a decision maker or service provider fee represents a variable interest.
An entity that qualifies for the deferral will continue to be assessed for consolidation under the overall guidance on variable interest entities in ASC 810-10 (before its amendment by SFAS No.167) or other applicable consolidation guidance, including guidance for the consolidation of partnerships in ASC 810-20. The amendment does not defer the disclosure requirements in SFAS No.167.
The new provisions of ASC 810-10 and ASU 2010-10 are both effective for the beginning of an entitys first annual reporting period that begins after November15, 2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter.
The Company does not expect the adoption of new provisions of ASC 810-10 and ASU 2009-17 to impact net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc. or its stockholders equity, however, it is currently evaluating the impact to its first quarter 2010 consolidated financial statements as a result of consolidating the assets and liabilities and net income (loss) of certain VIEs, in addition to a corresponding non-controlling interest liability or asset and allocation of net income (loss) to non-controlling interests primarily related to collateralized debt obligations that it manages, which do not qualify for the deferral.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Recent Accounting Developments Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements In January 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASU 2010-06). ASU 2010-06 amends ASC 820-10 to require new disclosures with regards to transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and other settlements within the Level 3 fair value rollforward. ASU 2010-06 also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the appropriate level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements that fall in either Level 2 or Level 3. The new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales and settlements in the rollforward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of the additional disclosure requirements of ASU 2010-06 are not expected to materially impact BlackRocks consolidated financial statements.
3. Mergers and Acquisitions Barclays Global Investors On December1, 2009, BlackRock acquired from Barclays all of the outstanding equity interests of subsidiaries of Barclays conducting the investment management business of BGI in exchange for an aggregate of 37,566,771 shares of BlackRock common stock and participating preferred stock, subject to certain adjustments, and $6.65 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments. The fair value of the 37,566,771 shares at closing, on December1, 2009, was $8.53 billion, at a price of $227.08 per share, the closing price of BlackRocks common stock on November30, 2009.
The acquisition of BGI brings together market leaders in active and index strategies to create the preeminent asset management firm which manages investments on behalf of institutional and retail investors worldwide. The combined firms products include passively and actively managed equities and fixed income, cash management, and alternatives and will offer clients diversified access to global markets through separate accounts, common trust funds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, hedge funds, and closed-end funds.
The shares of capital stock issued to Barclays pursuant to the BGI Transaction represented approximately 4.8% of the outstanding shares of common stock and approximately an aggregate 19.8% economic interest in BlackRock immediately following the closing of the transaction. Barclays generally is restricted from purchasing additional shares of BlackRock common or preferred stock if it would result in Barclays holding more than 4.9% of the total voting power of BlackRock or more than 19.9% of the total capital stock of BlackRock on a fully diluted basis. In addition, Barclays is restricted from transferring 100% of its BlackRock capital stock for one year after closing and 50% of its BlackRock capital stock for the second year, without the prior written consent of BlackRock.
The cash portion of the purchase price was funded through a combination of existing cash, issuance of short-term debt backed by a short-term credit facility which was arranged by Barclays, a related party, and subsequently terminated upon the issuance of long-term notes in December 2009, and proceeds from the private issuance of 19,914,652 capital shares, at a price of $140.60, to a group of institutional investors, including PNC.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 3. Mergers and Acquisitions (continued) Barclays Global Investors (continued) The BGI Transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities and non-controlling interests assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of the transaction. Substantially all of the excess of the final purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities and non-controlling interests assumed was recorded as non-deductible goodwill.
A summary of the recorded fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities and non-controlling interests assumed on December1, 2009 in this acquisition is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Estimate of Fair Value Accounts receivable $ 593 Investments 125 Separate account assets 116,301 Collateral held under securities lending agreements 23,498 Property and equipment 205 Finite-lived intangible management contracts (intangible assets) 163 Indefinite-lived intangible management contracts (intangible assets) 9,785 Trade names / trademarks (indefinite-lived intangible assets) 1,403 Goodwill 6,842 Other assets 366 Separate account liabilities (116,301 ) Collateral liability under securities lending agreements (23,498 ) Deferred tax liabilities (3,799 ) Accrued compensation and benefits (885 ) Other liabilities assumed (660 ) Non-controlling interests assumed (12 ) Total consideration, net of cash acquired $ 14,126 Summary of consideration, net of cash acquired: Cash paid $ 6,650 Cash acquired (1,055 ) Capital stock at fair value 8,531 Total cash and stock consideration $ 14,126 Finite-life management contracts have a weighted-average estimated useful life of approximately 10 years and are amortized on the straight-line method.
The fair value of BGI finite-lived management contracts consists primarily of separate accounts and custom segregated funds and the fair value of BGI indefinite-lived management contracts consists primarily of exchange traded funds, common and collective trusts and open-end funds.
The fair value of acquired trade names/trademarks was determined using a royalty rate based primarily on normalized marketing and promotion expenditures to develop and support the brands globally.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 3. Mergers and Acquisitions (continued) Barclays Global Investors (continued) The purchase accounting adjustments are preliminary and subject to revision. At this time, except for the items noted below, the Company does not expect material changes to the value of the assets acquired or liabilities assumed in conjunction with the transaction. Specifically, the following assets and liabilities are subject to change:  Intangible management contracts were valued using preliminary December1, 2009 AUM and assumptions. The value of such contracts may change, primarily as the result of updates to AUM and those assumptions;  As management receives additional information, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and other assets, due from and to related parties, and other liabilities may be adjusted as the result of changes in purchase accounting and applicable tax rates.
The following unaudited pro forma combined financial information does not purport to be indicative of actual results of BlackRocks operations had the BGI Transaction actually been consummated at the beginning of each period presented. Certain one-time charges that are directly attributable to the BGI Transaction have been eliminated.

Mergers and Acquisitions (continued) Barclays Global Investors (continued) BlackRock and BGI costs included as pro forma adjustments (unaudited) For purposes of the pro forma financial information above, the following costs have been removed as they are deemed to be one-time costs directly attributable to the BGI Transaction.
BlackRock results included $183 million of BlackRock pre-merger transaction and integration costs in conjunction with the BGI Transaction such as advisory fees, legal fees, consulting expenses recorded within general and administration expenses and compensation expense which have been expensed as incurred by BlackRock during the year ended December31, 2009.
BGI results for the eleven months ended November30, 2009 included $299 million of costs related to acceleration of certain compensation costs that were triggered due to the transaction.
BGI costs and benefits not included as pro forma adjustments (unaudited) For purposes of the pro forma financial information above, the following items which are in BGIs results and included in the pro forma results have not been removed as they are not directly attributable to the BGI Transaction:  A pre-tax expense of $2.285 billion for the year ended December31, 2008 and a pre-tax benefit of $1.249 billion, for the eleven-month period ended November30, 2009 related to capital support of certain BGI cash management products. The liability related to such capital support has not been assumed in the transaction as it will remain with Barclays.
BGIs tax expense for the year ended December31, 2008 and the eleven-month period ended November30, 2009 included a non-recurring tax benefit of approximately $695 million and a tax expense of $381 million, respectively, related to the capital support.
A pre-tax expense of $29 million for the eleven-month period ended November30, 2009 related to a BGI restructuring independent from the sale to BlackRock.
A pre-tax non-operating gain/(loss) of ($33) million and $1 million for the year ended December31, 2008 and the eleven-month period ended November30, 2009, respectively, related to valuation changes for certain investments that were not acquired by BlackRock.
If such costs and benefits were excluded the pro forma diluted EPS for 2009 would have decreased by $4.37 and for 2008 would have increased by $8.33.
Impact Investing In August 2008, the Company acquired Impact Investing, an Australia based software development company specializing in equity portfolio management and analytical software tools. The maximum remaining and total consideration to be paid is not expected to be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 3. Mergers and Acquisitions (continued) Quellos Group On October1, 2007, the Company closed the Quellos Transaction and paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and issued 1,191,785 shares of BlackRock common stock, valued at $188 million. The common stock was placed in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. The value of the common stock consideration was determined using the average closing price of BlackRocks common stock ten days before the Quellos Transaction announcement date.
In addition, Quellos may receive two contingent payments, upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December31, 2010, totaling up to $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. During 2009, the Company determined the first contingent payment to be $219 million, of which $11 million was previously paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $208 million, $156 million was paid in cash and $52 million was paid in common stock, or approximately 330,000 shares based on a price of $157.33 per share. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is based on investment advisory fees through 2010 and is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch-up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met though 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million.
The Quellos Transaction was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805 prior to the changes within ASC 805 which were adopted on January1, 2009. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of the transaction. The excess, if any, of the final purchase price, which may include contingent consideration payments, over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recorded as goodwill.
Finite-life intangible management contracts have a weighted average estimated useful life of approximately 7.4 years and are amortized on the straight-line method.
As contingencies are resolved, BlackRock common shares held in escrow may be released from escrow. In April 2008 and November 2009, 280,519 and 42,326 common shares, respectively, were released from escrow to Quellos in accordance with the Quellos asset purchase agreement, which resulted in an adjustment to the recognized purchase price. As additional shares held in escrow are released, and if contingent consideration payments are made to Quellos, additional purchase price consideration or employee compensation will be recorded.
Adjustments to goodwill related to tax benefits realized from tax-deductible goodwill in excess of the initial book goodwill established are discussed in Note 11, Goodwill.

Mergers and Acquisitions (continued) Fund of Hedge Funds On April30, 2003, the Company purchased an 80% interest in an investment manager of a hedge fund of funds for approximately $4 million in cash. On October1, 2007, the Company paid $27 million in cash to purchase the remaining 20% of the investment manager. The purchase price of the remaining interest was performance-based and was not subject to a maximum, minimum or the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As a result of the transaction in October 2007, $21 million and $8 million of additional goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, respectively, was recorded.

During the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded other-than-temporary impairments of $5 million, including $2 million related to credit loss impairments on debt securities, $8 million and $16 million, respectively, which were recorded in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. The $2 million credit loss impairment in 2009 was determined by comparing the estimated discounted cash flows versus the amortized cost for each individual security.
The Company has reviewed the gross unrealized losses of $1 million as of December31, 2009 related to available-for-sale equity securities, of which less than $1 million had been in a loss position for greater than twelve months, and determined that these unrealized losses were not other-than-temporary primarily because the Company has the ability and intent to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. As a result, the Company did not record additional impairments on such equity securities.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 6. Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment funds primarily because it is deemed to control such investments in accordance with GAAP. The investments that are owned by these consolidated sponsored investment funds are classified as other or trading investments. At December31, 2009 and 2008, the following balances related to these funds were consolidated in the consolidated statements of financial condition: (Dollar amounts in millions) December31, 2009 December31, 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 75 $ 61 Investments 463 728 Other net assets (liabilities) (7 ) 12 Non-controlling interests (273 ) (491 ) Total net interests in consolidated investment funds $ 258 $ 310 During 2009, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in one consolidated sponsored investment fund, which also commenced in 2009. The granting of the additional substantive rights resulted in deconsolidation of this fund and the elimination of $85 million, $76 million, and $9 million of investments, borrowings, and nonredeemable non-controlling interests, respectively. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. BlackRock deconsolidated these sponsored investment funds upon the grant of these additional rights.
BlackRocks total exposure to consolidated sponsored investment funds of $258 million and $310 million at December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, represents the value of the Companys economic ownership interest in these sponsored investment funds. Valuation changes associated with these consolidated investment funds are reflected in non-operating income (expense) and net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests. Less than $1 million and $6 million of borrowings by consolidated sponsored investment funds at December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
The Company may not be readily able to access cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company may not be readily able to sell investments held by consolidated sponsored investment funds in order to obtain cash for use in its operations.

Money Market Funds within Cash and Cash Equivalents At December31, 2009 and 2008, approximately $1.4 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively, of money market funds were recorded within cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Money market funds are valued through the use of quoted market prices (a Level 1 input), or $1, which is generally the net asset value of the fund.
Level 3 Assets Level 3 assets recorded within investments, which include equity method investments and consolidated investments of real estate funds, private equity funds and funds of private equity funds, are valued based upon valuations received from internal as well as third party fund managers. Fair valuations at the underlying funds are based on a combination of methods, which may include third-party independent appraisals and discounted cash flow techniques. Direct investments in private equity companies held by funds of private equity funds are valued based on an assessment of each underlying investment, incorporating evaluation of additional significant third party financing, changes in valuations of comparable peer companies, the business environment of the companies and market indices, among other factors. Level 3 assets recorded within separate account assets may include single broker non-binding quotes for fixed income securities.

(a) This category includes the underlying third party private equity funds within consolidated BlackRock sponsored private equity funds of funds. The fair values of the investments in the third party funds have been estimated using the net asset value of the Companys ownership interest in partners capital in each fund in the portfolio as well as other performance inputs. These investments are not subject to redemption, however for certain funds the Company may sell or transfer its interest, which may need approval by the general partner of the underlying funds. Due to the nature of the investments in this category the Company reduces its investment via distributions that are received through the realization of the underlying assets of the funds. It is estimated that the underlying assets of these funds would be liquidated over a weighted average period of approximately 9 years.
Total remaining unfunded commitments to other third party funds is $85 million. BlackRock is contractually obligated to fund only $54 million, its remaining unfunded commitment balance included in the above table to the consolidated fund while the remaining balance would be funded by capital contributions from non-controlling interest holders.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 7. Fair Value Disclosures (continued) Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value Per Share (continued) (b) This category includes several consolidated funds of funds that invest in multiple strategies to diversify risks. The fair values of the investments in this category have been estimated using the net asset value of the funds ownership interest in partners capital of each fund in the portfolio. Investments in this category can generally be redeemed, as long as there are no restrictions in place by the underlying funds.
(c) This category includes several private equity funds that initially invest in non-marketable securities of private companies which ultimately may become public in the future. The fair values of these investments have been estimated using the net asset value of the Companys ownership interest in partners capital as well as other performance inputs. The Companys investment in each fund is not subject to redemption and is normally returned through distributions as a result of the liquidation of the underlying assets of the private equity funds. It is estimated that the investment in these funds would be liquidated over a weighted average period of approximately 8 years.
(d) This category includes several real estate funds that invest primarily to acquire, expand, renovate, finance, hold for investment, and ultimately sell income-producing apartment properties or to capitalize on the distress in the residential real estate market. The fair values of the investments in this category have been estimated using the net asset value of the Companys ownership interest in partners capital. The Companys investment in each fund is not subject to redemption and is normally returned through distributions as a result of the liquidation of the underlying assets of the real estate funds. It is estimated that the investments in these funds would be liquidated over a weighted average period of approximately 14 years.
(e) This category includes hedge funds and funds of hedge funds that invest primarily in equities, fixed income securities, distressed credit and mortgage instruments and other third party hedge funds. The fair values of the investments in this category have been estimated using the net asset value of the Companys ownership interest in partners capital. It is estimated that the investments in the funds that are not subject to redemptions would be liquidated over a weighted average period of less than 8 years.
(f) This category includes investments in certain hedge funds that invest in energy and health science related equity securities. The fair values of the investments in this category have been estimated using the net asset value of the Companys ownership interest in partners capital as well as performance inputs.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 8. Variable Interest Entities In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles, including collateralized debt obligations and sponsored investment funds, which may be considered VIEs. The Company receives management fees or other incentive related fees for its services and may from time to time own equity or debt securities or enter into derivatives with the vehicles, each of which are considered variable interests. The Company enters into these variable interests principally to address client needs through the launch of such investment vehicles. The VIEs are primarily financed via capital contributed by equity and debt holders. The Companys involvement in financing the operations of the VIEs is limited to its equity interests, unfunded capital commitments for certain sponsored investment funds and two capital support agreements for two enhanced cash funds at December31, 2008 which were terminated in 2009, due to closure of the funds.
The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the enterprise that has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests, including those of related parties) that will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses, receive a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, realization of gains, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes.
VIEs in which BlackRock is the Primary Beneficiary As of December31, 2009 At December31, 2009, BlackRock was the primary beneficiary of one VIE, a private sponsored investment fund, in which it had a non-substantive investment, due to its de-facto third party relationships with other partners in the fund. Due to consolidation of this VIE, at December31, 2009, the Company recorded $54 million of net assets, primarily investments and cash and cash equivalents. These net assets were offset on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition by $54 million of nonredeemable non-controlling interests which reflect the equity ownership of third parties, on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. For the year ended December31, 2009, the Company recorded a non-operating expense of $4 million offset by a $4 million net loss attributable to nonredeemable non-controlling interests on its consolidated statements of income. The Company has no risk of loss with its involvement with this VIE.
F-51 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 8. Variable Interest Entities (continued) As of December31, 2008 VIEs in which BlackRock is the Primary Beneficiary (continued) During 2008, the Company determined it became the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash management funds as a result of concluding that under various cash flow scenarios it absorbed the majority of the variability to cover expected losses in the funds due to its equity ownership percentage of the funds along with its obligation under the Companys capital support agreements with the funds which were established to cover potential realized losses within the funds. During 2008, the Company contributed $1 million to the cash management funds to cover realized losses. As of December31, 2008, under the terms of the capital support agreements, BlackRock was obligated to cover realized losses of up to $45 million.
At December31, 2008, the Company was the primary beneficiary of three VIEs, which resulted in consolidation of three sponsored investment funds (including two cash management funds and one private equity fund of funds). Creditors of the VIEs do not have recourse to the credit of the Company.
(Dollar amounts in millions) VIE Net Assets that the Company Consolidates Maximum Risk of Loss Equity Interests Capital Support Agreements Total Sponsored enhanced cash management funds $ 328 $ 88 $ 45 $ 133 Other sponsored investment funds 55    Total $ 383 $ 88 $ 45 $ 133 As a result of consolidating the three private investment funds, at December31, 2008, the Company recorded $383 million of net assets, primarily investments and cash and cash equivalents which in consolidation is offset by $319 million of non-controlling interests which reflect the equity ownership of third parties, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. For the year ended December31, 2008, the Company recorded a non-operating expense of $12 million offset by a $13 million gain in non-controlling interests on its consolidated statements of income.
The maximum risk of loss related to the capital support agreements in the table of above reflect the Companys total obligation under the capital support agreements with the two enhanced cash funds. The fair value of the capital support agreements recorded at December31, 2008 was $18 million.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 8. Variable Interest Entities (continued) VIEs in which BlackRock holds significant variable interests or is the sponsor that holds a variable interest but is not the Primary Beneficiary of VIE At December31, 2009 and 2008, the Companys carrying value of assets and liabilities and its maximum risk of loss related to VIEs in which it holds a significant variable interest or is the sponsor that holds a variable interest, but for which it was not the primary beneficiary, were as follows: As of December31, 2009 (Dollar amounts in millions) Variable Interests on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition Maximum RiskofLoss Investments Receivables Other Net Assets (Liabilities) CDOs $ 2 $ 2 $ (2 ) $ 21 Other sponsored investment funds (1) 14 254 (7 ) 268 Total $ 16 $ 256 $ (9 ) $ 289 (1) Includes common trusts.
The size of the net assets of the VIEs that the Company does not consolidate related to CDOs, common trusts and other sponsored investment funds were as follows:  CDOs - approximately ($8)billion, comprised of approximately $10 billion of assets and $18 billion of liabilities, primarily comprised of debt obligations to CDO debt holders.
Other sponsored investments funds  approximately $1.5 trillion to $1.6 trillion  This amount includes approximately $1.1 trillion of common trusts. Each common trust has been aggregated separately and may include common trusts that invest in other common trusts.
The net assets of the VIEs are primarily comprised of cash and cash equivalents and investments offset by liabilities primarily comprised of various accruals for the sponsored investment vehicles.
At December31, 2009, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss associated with these VIEs primarily relates to: (i)BlackRocks equity investments, (ii)management fee receivables and (iii)credit protection sold by BlackRock to a third party in a synthetic CDO transaction. See Note 9, Derivatives and Hedging, for further information.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 9. Derivatives and Hedging For the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008, the Company did not hold any derivatives designated in a formal hedge relationship under ASC 815-10.
By using derivative financial instruments, the Company exposes itself to market and counterparty risk. Market risk from forward foreign currency exchange contracts is the effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in currency exchange rates. The Company manages exposure to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degrees of market risk that may be undertaken. At December31, 2009, the Company had two outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with two counterparties with an aggregate notional value of $100 million.
During 2007, the Company commenced a program to enter into a series of total return swaps to economically hedge against market price exposures with respect to certain seed investments in sponsored investment products. At December31, 2009, the Company had seven outstanding total return swaps with two counterparties with an aggregate notional value of approximately $36 million.
In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements, up to $100 million, with two enhanced cash funds. These capital support agreements were backed by letters of credit issued under BlackRocks revolving credit facility. In December 2008, the capital support agreements were modified to be up to $45 million and were no longer backed by the letters of credit. In 2009, the capital support agreements were terminated, due to the closure of the related funds. See Note 13, Borrowings, for further discussion. During the six months ended June30, 2009, the Company provided approximately $4 million of capital contributions to the funds under the capital support agreements. BlackRock determined that the capital support agreements qualified as derivatives under ASC 815-10. At December31, 2008, the fair value of the derivative liabilities related to the capital support agreements for the two funds totaled approximately $18 million, respectively. The fair value of these liabilities increased or decreased as BlackRocks obligations under the guarantee fluctuated based on the fair value of the derivative. Upon closure of the funds, the liability decreased $11 million and the change in the liability was included in general and administration expenses.
The Company acts as theportfoliomanager in a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction (Pillars).The Company has entered into a credit default swap with Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), providing Citibank credit protection of approximately $17 million, representing the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection.The Companys management has performed an assessment of its variable interest in Pillars (a collateral management agreement and the credit default swap) under ASC 810-10 and has concluded the Company is not Pillars primary beneficiary.Pursuant to ASC 815-10, the Company carries the Pillars credit default swap at fair value based on the expected future cash flows under the arrangement.
On behalf of clients that maintain separate accounts representing segregated funds held for purpose of funding individual and group pension contracts, the Company invests in various derivative instruments, including forward foreign currency contracts, interest rate and inflation rate swaps.
The Company may, at times, consolidate certain sponsored investment funds which utilize derivative instruments as a part of the funds investment strategy. The change in fair value of such derivatives which is recorded in non-operating income (expense) is not material to the Companys consolidated financial statements.

Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures (the Debentures), due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625%per annum. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on February15 and August15 of each year, and commenced August15, 2005.
Prior to February15, 2009, the Debentures could have been convertible at the option of the holder at a December31, 2008 conversion rate of 9.9639 shares of common stock per one dollar principal amount of Debentures under certain circumstances. The Debentures would have been convertible into cash and, in some situations as described below, additional shares of the Companys common stock, if during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period the trading price per Debenture for each day of such period is less than 103% of the product of the last reported sales price of BlackRocks common stock and the conversion rate of the Debentures on each such day or upon the occurrence of certain other corporate events, such as a distribution to the holders of BlackRock common stock of certain rights, assets or debt securities, if the Company becomes party to a merger, consolidation or transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or a change of control of the Company. On February15, 2009, the Debentures became convertible into cash at any time prior to maturity at the option of the holder and, in some situations as described below, additional shares of the Companys common stock at the current conversion rate.
F-62 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 13. Borrowings (continued) Convertible Debentures (continued) At the time the Debentures are tendered for conversion, for each one dollar principal amount of Debentures converted, a holder shall be entitled to receive cash and shares of BlackRock common stock, if any, the aggregate value of which (the conversion value) will be determined by multiplying the applicable conversion rate by the average of the daily volume weighted average price of BlackRock common stock for each of the ten consecutive trading days beginning on the second trading day immediately following the day the Debentures are tendered for conversion (the ten-day weighted average price). The Company will deliver the conversion value to holders as follows: (1)an amount in cash (the principal return) equal to the lesser of (a)the aggregate conversion value of the Debentures to be converted and (b)the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures to be converted, and (2)if the aggregate conversion value of the Debentures to be converted is greater than the principal return, an amount in shares (the net shares), determined as set forth below, equal to such aggregate conversion value less the principal return (the net share amount). The number of net shares to be paid will be determined by dividing the net share amount by the ten-day weighted average price. In lieu of delivering fractional shares, the Company will deliver cash based on the ten-day weighted average price.
The conversion rate for the Debentures is subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain corporate events, such as a change of control of the Company, each payment of quarterly dividends greater than $0.30 per share, the issuance of certain rights or warrants to holders of, or subdivisions on, BlackRocks common stock, a distribution of assets or indebtedness to holders of BlackRock common stock or a tender offer on the common stock. The conversion rate adjustments vary depending upon the specific corporate event necessitating the adjustment and serve to ensure that any economic gains realized by the Companys stockholders are shared with the holders of the Debentures. The initial conversion rate of 9.7282 was determined by the underwriters based on market conditions and has been subsequently revised to 10.0909 as a result of dividends paid by the Company that were in excess of $0.30 per share.
If the effective date or anticipated effective date of certain transactions that constitute a change of control occurs on or prior to February15, 2010, under certain circumstances, the Company will provide for a make-whole amount by increasing, for a certain time period, the conversion rate by a number of additional shares of common stock for any conversion of Debentures in connection with such transactions. The amount of additional shares will be determined based on the price paid per share of BlackRock common stock in the transaction constituting a change of control and the effective date of such transaction. However, if such transaction constitutes a public acquirer change of control, the Company may elect to issue shares of the acquiring company rather than BlackRock shares.
Beginning February20, 2010, the Company may redeem any of the Debentures at a redemption price of 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, including contingent interest and accrued and unpaid liquidated damages, if any upon not more than 60 but not less 30 days notice. Holders of the Debentures have the right to require the Company to repurchase the Debentures for cash on February15, 2010, 2015, 2020, 2025 and 2030. In addition, holders of the Debentures may require the Company to repurchase the Debentures for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, including contingent interest and accrued and unpaid liquidated damages, if any, (i)upon a change of control of the Company or (ii)if BlackRocks common stock is neither listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange nor approved for trading on the NASDAQ.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 13. Borrowings (continued) Convertible Debentures (continued) The Company is obligated to pay contingent interest, which is the amount of interest payable to holders of the Debentures for any six-month period from February15 to August15 or from August15 to February15, with the initial six-month period commencing February15, 2010, if the trading price of the Debentures for each of the ten trading days immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six-month period equals 120% or more of the principal amount of the Debentures. During any period when contingent interest is payable, the contingent interest payable per Debenture will equal 0.25% of the average trading price of the Debentures during the ten trading days immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six-month interest period.
On October16, 2008, the Debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock, after the trustee determined that the trading price for the debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. The conversion period ended on October30, 2008 after the Debentures failed to satisfy the trading price condition on October24, 2008. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of Debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares.
During 2009, subsequent to the debentures becoming convertible on February15, 2009 into cash and shares of the Companys common stock at any time prior to maturity, the holders of $7 million of Debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. In addition, during January and February 2010, holders of $148 million of debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares.
The Company recognized $10 million in each of the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008 of interest expense, comprised in both periods of $6 million and $7 million related to the coupon and $4 million and $3 million related to amortization of the discount for the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Legal Proceedings From time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various U.S. federal, state governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide or other investigations or proceedings. It is BlackRocks policy to cooperate fully with such inquiries. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRocks activities. Additionally, certain of the investment funds that the Company manages are subject to lawsuits, any of which potentially could harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the Company being liable to the funds for any resulting damages.
Management, after consultation with legal counsel, currently does not anticipate that the aggregate liability, if any, arising out of regulatory matters or lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on BlackRocks earnings, financial position, or cash flows although, at the present time, management is not in a position to determine whether any such pending or threatened matters will have a material adverse effect on BlackRocks results of operations in any future reporting period.
Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts pursuant to which it may agree to indemnify third parties in certain circumstances. The terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 14. Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Indemnifications (continued) Under the transaction agreement in the MLIM Transaction, the Company has agreed to indemnify Merrill Lynch for losses it may incur arising from (1)any alleged or actual breach, failure to comply, violation or other deficiency with respect to any regulatory or fiduciary requirements relating to the operation of BlackRocks business, (2)any fees or expenses incurred or owed by BlackRock to any brokers, financial advisors or comparable other persons retained or employed by BlackRock in connection with the MLIM Transaction, and (3)certain specified tax covenants.
Under the transaction agreement in the BGI Transaction, the Company has agreed to indemnify Barclays for losses it may incur arising from (1)breach by the Company of certain representations, (2)breach by the Company of any covenant in the agreement, (3)liabilities of the entities acquired in the transaction other than liabilities assumed by Barclays or for which it is providing indemnification, and (4)certain taxes.
Management believes that the likelihood of any liability arising under these indemnification provisions is remote.Management cannot estimate any potential maximum exposuredue both to the remoteness of any potential claims and the fact that items that wouldbe included within any such calculatedclaim would be beyond the control of BlackRock. Consequently, no liability has been recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 15. Stock-Based Compensation (continued) Stock Options Stock option grants were made to certain employees pursuant to the Award Plan in 1999 through 2003. Options granted have a ten-year life, vest ratably over periods ranging from two to five years and become exercisable upon vesting. Prior to the January 2007 grant described below, the Company had not granted any stock options since 2003. Stock option activity for the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 is summarized below: Outstanding at Shares under option Weighted average exercise price December31, 2006 4,457,669 $ 36.90 Granted 1,545,735 $ 167.76 Exercised (1,899,239 ) $ 36.96 Forfeited (3,000 ) $ 37.36 December31, 2007 4,101,165 $ 86.19 Exercised (662,013 ) $ 36.36 Forfeited (298,635 ) $ 167.76 December31, 2008 3,140,517 $ 88.82 Exercised (490,617 ) $ 34.92 Forfeited (8,064 ) $ 167.76 December31, 2009 (1) 2,641,836 $ 98.59 (1) At December31, 2009, approximately 2.6million options were vested or are expected to vest.
On January31, 2007, the Company awarded options to purchase 1,545,735 shares of BlackRock common stock to certain executives as long-term incentive compensation. The options will vest on September29, 2011, as the Company had actual GAAP earnings per share in excess of $5.20 in 2009. The options have a strike price of $167.76, which was the closing price of the shares on the grant date. Fair value, as calculated in accordance with a modified Black-Scholes model, was approximately $45.88 per option. The fair value of the options is being amortized over the vesting period as exceeding the performance hurdles was deemed probable of occurring.
Assumptions used in calculating the grant-date fair value for the stock options issued in January 2007 were as follows: Exercise price $ 167.76 Expected term (years) 7.335 Expected volatility 24.5 % Dividend yield 1.0%-4.44% Risk-Free interest rate 4.8 % F-71 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 15. Stock-Based Compensation (continued) Stock Options (continued) The Companys expected option term was derived using the mathematical average between the earliest vesting date and the option expiration date in accordance with ASC 718. The Companys expected stock volatility assumption was based upon historical stock price fluctuations of BlackRocks common stock. The dividend yield assumption was derived using estimated dividends over the expected term and the stock price at the date of grant. The risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield at date of grant.
The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $63 million, $113 million and $268 million, respectively.
Stock options outstanding and exercisable at December31, 2009 are as follows: Options Outstanding Options Exercisable (Dollar amounts in millions) Exercise Prices Options Outstanding Weighted Average Remaining Life (years) Weighted Average Exercise Price Options Exercisable Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Life (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value of Exercisable Shares (pershare) $ 37.36 1,309,300 2.79 $ 37.36 1,309,300 $ 37.36 2.79 $ 255 $ 43.31 96,500 0.96 $ 43.31 96,500 $ 43.31 0.96 18 $ 167.76 1,236,036 7.09 $ 167.76     2,641,836 4.74 $ 98.59 1,405,800 $ 37.77 2.66 $ 273 F-72 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 15. Stock-Based Compensation (continued) Stock Options (continued) Fiscal year 2008 included a cumulative adjustment to the estimated forfeiture rate for unvested stock options as a result of additional data on actual forfeiture activity.
As of December31, 2009, the Company had $21 million in unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock options. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of 1.8 years.
Restricted Stock and RSUs Pursuant to the Award Plan, restricted stock grants and RSUs may be granted to certain employees. Restricted stock was issued for stock awards prior to 2006. RSUs were issued for the majority of grants in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. These restricted shares and RSUs vest over periods ranging from one to five years and are expensed on the straight-line method over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards. Prior to 2009, the Company awarded restricted stock and RSUs with nonforfeitable dividend equivalent rights. Restricted stock and RSUs awarded in 2009 are not considered participating securities as dividend equivalents are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting of the award.

Stock-Based Compensation (continued) Restricted Stock and RSUs (continued) Restricted stock and RSU activity for the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 is summarized below: Outstanding at Unvested Restricted Stock and Units Weighted Average GrantDate Fair Value December31, 2006 1,515,890 $ 130.49 Granted 2,551,913 $ 167.64 Converted (274,164 ) $ 104.15 Forfeited (84,631 ) $ 159.95 December31, 2007 3,709,008 $ 158.01 Granted 1,618,161 $ 201.80 Converted (468,046 ) $ 146.69 Forfeited (255,170 ) $ 163.64 December31, 2008 4,603,953 $ 174.24 Granted 1,869,849 $ 118.43 Converted (894,909 ) $ 178.53 Forfeited (218,430 ) $ 157.21 December31, 2009 (1) 5,360,463 $ 154.75 (1) At December31, 2009, approximately 4.9million awards are expected to vest.
On January25, 2007, the Company issued approximately 901,200 RSUs to employees in conjunction with their annual incentive compensation awards. The RSU awards vest over three years through January 2010. The value of the RSUs was calculated using BlackRocks closing stock price on the date of grant, or $169.70. The grant date fair value of the RSUs is being amortized into earnings on the straight-line method over the requisite service period, net of expected forfeitures, for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. In addition, in January 2007, the Company granted 1,559,022 of RSUs as long-term incentive compensation, which will be funded by shares currently held by PNC.
In January 2008 and 2009, the Company granted 295,633 and 23,417 RSUs, respectively, as long-term incentive compensation, which will be partially funded by shares currently held by PNC (see Long-Term Incentive Plans Funded by PNC below). The awards cliff vest five years from the date of grant.
F-74 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 15. Stock-Based Compensation (continued) Restricted Stock and RSUs (continued) In January 2008 and 2009, the Company granted 1,212,759 and 1,789,685 RSUs, respectively, to employees as part of annual incentive compensation under the Award Plan that vest ratably over three years from the date of grant.
At December31, 2009, there was $291 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock and RSUs. As of December31, 2009, the unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 1.6 years.
In January 2010, the Company granted the following awards under the Award Plan:  846,884 RSUs to employees as part of annual incentive compensation that vest ratably over three years from the date of grant.
256,311 RSUs to employees that cliff vest on January31, 2012. Awards to certain individuals require that BlackRock has actual GAAP earnings per share of at least $6.13 in 2010 or $6.50 in 2011 or has attained an alternative performance hurdle based on the Companys earnings per share growth rate versus certain peers over the term of the awards. The RSUs may not be sold before the one-year anniversary of the vesting date.
1,497,222 RSUs to employees that vest 50% on both January31, 2013 and 2014. Awards to certain individuals require that BlackRock has actual GAAP earnings per share of at least $6.13 in 2010 or $6.50 in 2011 or has attained an alternative performance hurdle based on the Companys earnings per share growth rate versus certain peers over the term of the awards.
124,575 shares of restricted common stock to employees that vest in tranches on January31, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The restricted common stock may not be sold before the one-year anniversary of each vesting date.
Long-Term Incentive Plans Funded by PNC Under a share surrender agreement, PNC committed to provide up to 4,000,000 shares of BlackRock stock, held by PNC, to fund certain BlackRock long-term incentive plans (LTIP). In February 2009, the share surrender agreement was amended for PNC to provide BlackRock series C non-voting participating preferred stock to fund the remaining committed shares.
The BlackRock, Inc. 2002 Long-Term Retention and Incentive Plan (the 2002 LTIP Awards) permitted the grant of up to $240 million in deferred compensation awards, of which the Company previously granted approximately $233 million. Approximately $208 million of the 2002 LTIP Awards were paid in January 2007. The 2002 LTIP Awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to plan participants. Approximately $6 million of previously issued 2002 LTIP Awards will result in the settlement of BlackRock shares held by PNC through 2010 at a conversion price approximating the market price on the settlement date. The fair value of the remaining 2002 LTIP Awards are accrued prior to settlement over the remaining service period in accrued compensation and benefits on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
The settlement of the 2002 LTIP Awards in January 2007 resulted in the surrender by PNC of approximately 1million shares of BlackRock stock. Under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. On the payment date, the Company recorded a capital contribution from PNC for the amount of shares funded by PNC.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 15. Stock-Based Compensation (continued) Restricted Stock and RSUs (continued) For the shares not put back to the Company, no dilution resulted from the delivery of stock pursuant to the awards since they were funded by shares held by PNC and were issued and outstanding at December31, 2006. Put elections made by employees were accounted for as treasury stock repurchases and are accretive to the Companys earnings per share. The shares repurchased were retained as treasury stock.
During 2007, the Company granted additional long-term incentive awards, out of the Award Plan, of approximately 1.6 million RSUs, that will be settled using BlackRock shares held by PNC in accordance with the share surrender agreement. The RSU awards will vest on September29, 2011, the end of the service condition, as BlackRock had actual GAAP earnings per share in excess of $5.20 in 2009. The value of the RSUs was calculated using BlackRocks closing stock price on the date of grant. The grant date fair value of the RSUs is being amortized as an expense on the straight-line method over the vesting period, net of expected forfeitures. The maximum value of awards that may be funded by PNC, prior to the earlier of September29, 2011 or the date the performance criteria are met, is approximately $271 million, all of which has been granted as of December31, 2009.
Subsequent to September29, 2011, the remaining committed PNC shares, of approximately 1.3 million, would be available to fund future long-term incentive awards.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan Effective January 2007, the terms of the amended ESPP allow eligible employees to purchase the Companys common stock at 95% of the fair market value on the last day of each three-month offering period. In accordance with ASC 718-10, Compensation  Stock Compensation, the Company does not record compensation expense related to employees purchasing shares under the amended ESPP.
16. Employee Benefit Plans Deferred Compensation Plans Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plan Effective January 2002, the Company adopted a Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plan (VDCP) which allows participants to elect to defer between 1% and 100% of that portion of the employees annual incentive compensation not mandatorily deferred under the Involuntary Deferred Compensation Plan (IDCP). The participants must specify a deferral period of one, three, five or ten years. The Company funds the obligation through the establishment of a rabbi trust on behalf of the participants in the plan.
F-76 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 16. Employee Benefit Plans (continued) Deferred Compensation Plans (continued) Involuntary Deferred Compensation Plan Effective January 2002, the Company adopted an IDCP for the purpose of providing deferred compensation and retention incentives to key officers and employees. The IDCP provided for a mandatory deferral of up to 15% of annual incentive compensation. For annual incentive awards for fiscal years prior to 2005, the mandatory deferral was matched by BlackRock in an amount equal to 20% of the deferral for employees with total compensation above certain levels. The matching contribution related to the mandatory deferral vests on the third anniversary of the deferral date. The Company funds the obligation through a rabbi trust established on behalf of the participants in the plan. No mandatory deferrals under the IDCP have been made since the annual incentive awards for fiscal year 2004.
During 2008, the IDCP was liquidated and all assets were distributed to the existing participants.
Rabbi Trust The rabbi trust established for the IDCP and VDCP, with assets totaling $57 million and $49 million as of December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, is reflected in investments on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. Such investments are classified as trading and other investments. The corresponding liability balance of $57 million and $41 million as of December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, is reflected in the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition as accrued compensation and benefits. Earnings in the rabbi trust, including unrealized appreciation or depreciation, are reflected as non-operating income or loss and changes in the corresponding liability are reflected as employee compensation and benefits expense in the consolidated statements of income.
Other Deferred Compensation Plans The Company has additional compensation plans for the purpose of providing deferred compensation and retention incentives to certain employees. The final value of the deferred amount to be distributed upon vesting is associated with the returns of certain investment funds. The liability balances for these plans were $38 million and $9 million as of December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are reflected in the Companys statements of financial condition as accrued compensation and benefits.
SSR and Realty had deferred compensation plans which allowed participants to elect to defer a portion of their annual incentive compensation or commissions for either a fixed term or until retirement and invest the funds in specified investments. SSR has funded a portion of the obligation through the purchase of company-owned life insurance (COLI) policies to the benefit of SSR. The COLI assets are carried at fair value on the consolidated statement of financial condition, and at December31, 2009 and 2008, the value of the COLI assets was $11 million and $9 million, respectively, which were recorded in other assets. Changes in the cash surrender value of the COLI policies are recorded to non-operating income in the consolidated statements of income. In addition, the Company has recorded a related obligation to repay the deferred incentive compensation, plus applicable earnings, to employees, which totaled $11 million and $9 million which were recorded in accrued compensation and benefits on the consolidated statement of financial condition as of December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Changes in the Companys obligation under the these plans, as a result of appreciation of the underlying investments in an employees account, are recorded as compensation and benefits expense in the consolidated statements of income. Both plans no longer allow participants to defer a portion of their annual incentive compensation or commissions.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 16. Employee Benefit Plans (continued) Defined Contribution Plans BlackRock Retirement Savings Plan Certain of the Companys employees participate in the BlackRock Retirement Savings Plan (BRSP). Under the BRSP, employee contributions of up to 6% of eligible compensation, as defined by the plan and subject to Internal Revenue Code limitations, are matched by the Company at 50%. As part of the BRSP, the Company also will make an annual retirement contribution on behalf of each eligible participant equal to no less than 3% of eligible compensation, plus an additional amount, determined in the discretion of the Company, not to exceed 2% of eligible compensation for a total contribution of no more than 5% of eligible compensation. The BRSP expense for the Company was $24 million, $33 million, and $31 million for the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Contributions to the BRSP are made in cash and no new investments in BlackRock stock or matching contributions of stock are available in the BRSP.
BGI 401(k) Savings Plan The Company assumed a 401(k) Plan covering employees of BGI (the BGI Plan) as a result of the BGI Transaction. As part of the Barclays Global Investors Plan, employee contributions are matched at 200% of participants pre-tax contributions up to 2% of an employees base salary, and matched 100% of the next 2% of base salary, as defined by the plan and subject to Internal Revenue Code limitations. The maximum matching contribution a participant can receive is an amount equal to 6% of the base salary. The BGI Plan expense was immaterial to the Companys financial statements for the year ended December31, 2009.
BGI Retirement Plan The Company assumed a defined contribution money purchase pension plan (BGI Retirement Plan) as a result of the BGI Transaction. All salaried employees of BGI and its participating affiliates who are U.S. residents and on the U.S. payroll are eligible to participate. For participants earning less than $100,000 in base salary, the Company contributes 6% of a participants total compensation (base salary and performance bonus) up to $100,000. For participants earning $100,000 or more in base salary, the Company contributes 6% of a participants base salary up to $245,000. These contributions are 25% vested once the participant has completed two years of service and then vest at a rate of 25% for each additional year of service completed. Employees with five or more years of service under the BGI Retirement Plan are 100% vested in their entire balance. The BGI Retirement Plan expense was immaterial to the Companys financial statements for the year ended December31, 2009.
BlackRock Group Personal Pension Plan BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Limited (BIM), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, contributes to the BlackRock Group Personal Pension Plan, a defined contribution plan for all employees of BIM. BIM contributes between 6% and 15% of each employees eligible compensation.
Research and Realty Plans The Company assumed two 401(k) Plans covering employees of SSR and Realty (the Research Plan and Realty Plan, respectively) as a result of the SSR Transaction. Effective with the closing of the SSR Transaction, contributions ceased for all participants in the Research Plan and selected participants in the Realty Plan and the Research Plan was closed to new participants. All participants for which contributions ceased in either the Research Plan or Realty Plan, participated in the ISP through September30, 2006 and became participants of the BRSP thereafter. For all employees who were active participants in the Realty Plan, employee contributions of up to 3% of eligible compensation, as well as an additional 50% of the next 2% of eligible compensation, subject to Internal Revenue Code limitations, were matched by the Company.
F-78 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) Effective November1, 2007, the Company merged the assets of the Research Plan and select participant accounts of the Realty Plan into the BRSP.
16. Employee Benefit Plans (continued) Defined Benefit Plans Prior to the BGI Transaction, the Company had several defined benefit pension plans in Japan, Germany, Luxembourg and Jersey. All accrued benefits under these defined benefit plans are currently frozen and the plans are closed to new participants. In 2008 the defined benefit pension values in Luxembourg were transferred into a new defined contribution plan for such employees, removing future liabilities. Otherwise, participant benefits under the plans will not change with salary increases or additional years of service. The unfunded liabilities are immaterial to the Companys 2009 and 2008 consolidated statements of financial condition.
Through the BGI Transaction, the Company assumed defined benefit pension plans in Japan and Germany, the Japan Plan and the Germany Plan, which are closed to new participants. At December31, 2009, the plan assets for these plans were approximately $10 million and the unfunded obligations were less than $3 million which were recorded in accrued compensation and benefits in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Benefit payments for the next five years and in aggregate for the five years thereafter are not expected to be material Defined benefit plan assets for the Japan Plan of approximately $7 million are invested using a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equity securities, debt securities and other investments are used to preserve asset values, diversify risk and achieve the target investment return benchmark. Investment strategies and asset allocations are based on consideration of plan liabilities and the funded status of the plan. Investment performance and asset allocation are measured and monitored on an ongoing basis. The current target allocations for the plan assets are 39-44% for equity securities, 52-54% for fixed income securities and 4-7% for cash. Equity securities include U.S. and international equity securities and fixed income securities include long-duration bond funds.
Defined benefit plan assets for the Germany Plan of approximately $3 million are invested in a balanced portfolio comprised of two major components: an equity portion and a fixed income portion. The expected role of defined benefit plan equity investments is to maximize the long-term real growth of fund assets, while the role of fixed income investments is to generate current income, provide for more stable periodic returns and provide some protection against a prolonged decline in the market value of equity investments.
Post-retirement Benefit Plans Prior to the BGI Transaction, the Company had requirements to deliver post-retirement medical benefits to a closed population based in the United Kingdom. For the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, expenses for these benefits were immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements.
Through the BGI Transaction, the Company assumed a requirement to deliver post-retirement medical benefits to a closed population of former BGI employees in the United States and the United Kingdom.
The post-retirement medical plan costs are developed from actuarial valuations which include key assumptions, including the discount rate and health care cost trends. Material changes in retiree medical plan benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions, changes in the number of plan participants and increases in the cost of healthcare.
F-79 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 16. Employee Benefit Plans (continued) Post-retirement Benefit Plans (continued) Accrued post-retirement costs are included in accrued compensation and benefits in the consolidated statements of financial condition. At December31, 2009, the accumulated benefit obligation was approximately $14 million and is unfunded. For the one month ended December31, 2009, expenses for these benefits were immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Benefit payments for the next five years and in aggregate for the five years thereafter are not expected to be material. The estimated impact of a one percentage-point change in the discount rate would be a change of less than $1million on 2009 pension expense and would change the projected benefit obligation by less than $3 million.
17. Related Party Transactions Determination of Related Parties As a result of the BGI Transaction, Barclays acquired approximately 19.8% of the total capital stock of BlackRock.See Note3, Mergers and Acquisitions, for further discussion. The Company has considered Barclays, along with its affiliates, to be related parties in accordance with ASC 850-10, Related Party Disclosures (ASC 850-10), since the closing of the BGI Transaction based on its level of ownership. At December31, 2009, Barclays owned approximately 4.8% of the Companys common stock and held approximately 19.8% of the total capital stock.
As a result of the MLIM Transaction in 2006 the Company considered Merrill Lynch, along with its affiliates, to be related parties, since the closing of the MLIM Transaction based on its level of ownership. At December31, 2009, Merrill Lynch owned approximately 3.7% of the Companys voting common stock and held approximately 34.2% of the total capital stock.
For the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company considered PNC, along with its affiliates, to be related parties based on the level of its ownership of BlackRock capital stock. At December31, 2009, PNC owned approximately 35.2% of the Companys voting common stock and held approximately 24.5% of the total capital stock.
For the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company considers its registered investment companies, which include mutual funds and exchanged traded funds, to be related parties as a result of the Companys advisory relationship. In addition, equity method investments are considered related parties in accordance with ASC 850-10 due to the Companys influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 18.

As a result such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.

Banking Regulatory Requirements BTC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is chartered as a national bank whose powers are limited to trust activities. BTC is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Under the capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that invoke quantitative measures of the Companys assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under the regulatory accounting practices. BTCs capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.
To be categorized as adequately capitalized, BTC must maintain minimum Total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based (capital to risk weighted assets), and Tier 1 leverage ratios (capital to average assets) as set forth in the table below. BTC has sufficient capital to be considered adequately capitalized.
The following schedule provides BTCs regulatory capital amounts and ratios at December31, 2009 as well as the required capital amounts to be considered well capitalized under prompt correct action provisions of Section38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act: (Dollar amounts in millions) Actual For Capital Adequacy Purposes To Be Well CapitalizedUnder Prompt Corrective Action Provisions Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio December31, 2009 Total Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) $ 629 86.0 % $ 59 8.0 % $ 73 10.0 % Tier 1 capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) $ 629 86.0 % $ 29 4.0 % $ 44 6.0 % Tier 1 capital (to Average Assets) $ 629 48.9 % $ 51 4.0 % $ 64 5.0 % F-87 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 21. Income Taxes (continued) Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded net when related to the same tax jurisdiction. At December31, 2009, the Company recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition deferred income tax assets, within other assets, and deferred tax liabilities of $23 million and $5,526 million, respectively. At December31, 2008, the Company recorded on the statement of financial condition deferred income tax assets, within other assets, and deferred tax liabilities of $11 million and $1,826 million, respectively.
During third quarter 2009, legislation was enacted primarily with respect to New York City corporate income taxes, effective January1, 2009 which resulted in a revaluation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities. As a result, the Company recorded a one-time deferred income tax benefit of $45 million in 2009.
The Company had a deferred tax asset related to unrealized investment losses of approximately $163 million and $157 million for the as of December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, reflecting the Companys conclusion that based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. During 2008, the Company incurred investment losses of $573 million primarily related to unrealized losses on investments. Substantially all of the investment losses relate to investments held by subsidiaries in the United States. After the allocation of net loss attributable to non-controlling interests of $155 million, the net loss on investments was $418 million. A portion of net loss is expected to be ordinary if recognized and, as a result, will not be subject to any limitations. Realized capital losses may be carried back three years and carried forward five years and offset against realized capital gains for federal income tax purposes. The Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and to generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses.
As of December31, 2009, the Company had a foreign net operating loss carryforward of $14 million which expires on or before 2016. In addition, at December31, 2009, the Company had U.S. capital loss carryforwards of $125 million, which were acquired in the BGI Transaction and which will expire on or before 2013.
At December31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had $64 million and $14 million of valuation allowances, respectively, recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The year over year increase in the valuation allowance primarily related to U.S. capital loss carryforwards, acquired in the BGI Transaction, which may be subject to utilization restrictions and certain foreign deferred tax assets.
Goodwill recorded in connection with the Quellos Transaction has been reduced during the period by the amount of tax benefit realized from tax-deductible goodwill. See Note 11, Goodwill, for further discussion.
Current income taxes are recorded net in the consolidated statements of financial condition when related to the same tax jurisdiction. As of December31, 2009, the Company had current income taxes receivable and payable of $271 million and $96 million, respectively, recorded in other assets and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, respectively. As of December31, 2008, the Company had current income taxes receivable and payable of $44 million and $120 million, respectively, recorded in other assets and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, respectively.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 21. Income Taxes (continued) The Company does not provide the deferred taxes on the excess of the financial reporting over tax basis on its investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. The excess totaled $778 million and $561 million as of December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The determination of the additional deferred taxes on the excess have not been provided because it is not practicable due to the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.
As a result of the adoption of ASC 740-10 related to uncertainty in income taxes, the Company recognized approximately $15 million in increased income tax reserves related to uncertain tax positions. Approximately $14 million of this increase related to taxes that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized, and this portion was accounted for as a reduction to the January1, 2007 balance in retained earnings. The remaining $1 million balance, if disallowed, would not affect the annual effective tax rate and is recorded in deferred tax assets, which is reflected in other assets on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. Total gross unrecognized tax benefits at January1, 2007 were approximately $52 million. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would have affected the effective tax rate at January1, 2007, was approximately $26 million.
The following tabular reconciliation presents the total amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which are recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Balance at January1 $ 114 $ 66 $ 52 Additions for tax positions of prior years 11 12 1 Reductions for tax positions of prior years (1 ) (2 ) (11 ) Additions based on tax positions related to current year 63 42 24 Lapse of statute of limitations    Settlements (16 ) (7 )  Foreign exchange translation (3 ) 3  Positions assumed in BGI Transaction 117   Balance at December31 $ 285 $ 114 $ 66 Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, are $184 million, $60 million and $41 million of tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above, the Company accrued interest and penalties of $8 million during 2009 and in total, as of December31, 2009, has recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $48 million, of which $28 million was assumed in the BGI Transaction. During 2008, the Company accrued interest and penalties of $5 million and in total, as of December31, 2008, had recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $11 million. During 2007, the Company accrued interest and penalties of $2 million and in total, as of December31, 2007, had recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $6 million.
Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company will be indemnified by Barclays for $72 million of unrecognized tax benefits, which is reflected as an offsetting asset in due from related parties on the Companys statements of financial condition.
BlackRock is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in multiple jurisdictions. The tax years after 2004 remain open to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examination, and the tax years after 2005 remain open to income tax examination in the United Kingdom. With few exceptions, as of December31, 2009, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before 2005. The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining the Company's 2006 and 2007 tax years. The Company is currently under audit in several state and foreign jurisdictions.
F-95 Table of Contents BlackRock, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) 21. Income Taxes (continued) As of December31, 2009, it is reasonably possible the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within the next twelve months. Until formal resolutions are reached between the Company and tax authorities, the determination of a possible audit settlement range with respect to the impact on unrecognized tax benefits is not practicable. The Company does not anticipate that any possible adjustments resulting from these audits would result in a material change to its consolidated financial statements.
Prior to September29, 2006, BlackRock had filed selected state and municipal income tax returns with one or more PNC subsidiaries on a combined or unitary basis. When BlackRock was included in a groups combined or unitary state or municipal income tax filing with PNC subsidiaries, BlackRocks share of the liability generally was an allocation to BlackRock of a percentage of the total tax liability based upon BlackRocks level of activity in such state or municipality. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows.

As such, the Company has included the outstanding series A, B, C and D non-voting participating preferred stock in the calculation of average basic and diluted shares outstanding for the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.
