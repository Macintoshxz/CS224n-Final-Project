BUSINESS SEGMENTS Our principal operations are currently organized, for management reporting purposes, into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served:Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking.The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments.
1 Table of Contents  Credit Card: Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending,national small business lending, national closed end installment lending and the international card lending businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom.
Consumer Banking: Consists of our branch-based lending and deposit gathering activities for consumer and small businesses, national deposit gathering, national automobile lending and consumer home loan lending and servicing activities.
Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending, deposit gathering and treasury management services to commercial real estate and middle market customers.
Certain activities that are not part of a segment are included in our Other category.See Item 7.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A)Executive Summary and Business Outlook, MD&ABusiness Segment Financial Performance and Item 8. Financial Statement and Supplementary DataNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our business segments.
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION General We are a bank holding company (BHC) under Section3 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHC Act) (12 U.S.C.  1842) and are subject to the requirements of the BHC Act, including its capital adequacy standards and limitations on our nonbanking activities. We are also subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board (the Federal Reserve).
Permissible activities for a BHC include those activities that are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto, such as consumer lending and other activities that have been approved by the Federal Reserve by regulation or order. Certain servicing activities are also permissible for a BHC if conducted for or on behalf of the BHC or any of its affiliates. Impermissible activities for BHCs include activities that are related to commerce such as retail sales of nonfinancial products. Under Federal Reserve policy, we are expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to any banks that we control, including the Banks, and to commit resources to support them.
On May27, 2005, we became a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act amendments to the BHC Act (the GLBA). The GLBA removed many of the restrictions on the activities of BHCs that become financial holding companies. A financial holding company, and the non-bank companies under its control, are permitted to engage in activities considered financial in nature (including, for example, insurance underwriting, agency sales and brokerage, securities underwriting and dealing and merchant banking activities), incidental to financial activities or complementary to financial activities if the Federal Reserve determines that they pose no risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system in general.
Our election to become a financial holding company under the GLBA certifies that the depository institutions we control meet certain criteria, including capital, management and Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) requirements. Effective July 21, 2011, under amendments to the BHC Act enacted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), we also must be well capitalized and well managed. If we were to fail to continue to meet the criteria for financial holding company status, we could, depending on which requirements we failed to meet, face restrictions on new financial activities or acquisitions or be required to discontinue existing activities that are not generally permissible for bank holding companies. The Banks are national associations chartered under the laws of the United States, the deposits of which are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) up to applicable limits. In addition to regulatory requirements imposed as a result of COBNAs international operations (discussed below), the Banks are subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the FDIC.
We are also registered as a financial institution holding company under Virginia law and, as such, we are subject to periodic examination by Virginias Bureau of Financial Institutions. We face regulation in the international jurisdictions in which we conduct business (see below under Regulation of International Business by NonU.S. Authorities).
Regulation of Business Activities The activities of the Banks as consumer lenders also are subject to regulation under various federal laws, including the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the FCRA), the CRA and the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, as well as under various state laws. Depending on the underlying issue and applicable law, regulators are often authorized to impose penalties for violations of these statutes and, in certain cases, to order the Banks to compensate injured borrowers. Borrowers may also have a private right of action for certain violations. Federal bankruptcy and state debtor relief and collection laws also affect the ability of the Banks to collect outstanding balances owed by borrowers. These laws plus state sales finance laws also affect the ability of our automobile financing business to collect outstanding balances.
2 Table of Contents New Regulations of Consumer Lending Activities The Credit CARD Act (amending the Truth-In-Lending Act) enacted in May 2009, and related changes to Regulation Z, impose a number of restrictions on credit card practices impacting rates and fees and update the disclosures required for open-end credit. For example, increases in rates charged on pre-existing card balances are restricted, and rates increased since January 1, 2009, must now be considered for possible reductions.Overlimit fees may not be imposed without prior consent, and the number of such fees that can be charged for the same violation is constrained.The amount of any penalty fee or charge must be reasonable and proportional to the violation.Payments above the minimum payment must be allocated first to balances with the highest interest rate.The amount of fees charged to credit card accounts with lower credit lines is limited.A consumers ability to pay must be taken into account before issuing credit or increasing credit limits.
State Consumer Financial Laws The Dodd-Frank Act created a new independent supervisory body, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB) that will become the primary regulator for federal consumer financial statutes.State attorneys general will be authorized to enforce new regulations issued by the CFPB. State consumer financial laws will continue to be preempted under the National Bank Act under the existing standard set forth in the Supreme Court decision in Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson , which preempts any state law that significantly interferes with or impairs banking powers.OCC determinations of such preemption, however, must be on a case-by-case basis, and courts reviewing the OCC's preemption determinations will now consider the appropriateness of those determinations under a different standard of judicial review.As a result,state consumer financial laws enacted in the future may be held to apply to our business activities.
Mortgage Lending The Dodd-Frank Act prescribes additional disclosure requirements and substantive limitations on our mortgage lending activities. Most of these provisions require the issuance of regulations by the CFPB or other federal agencies before they become effective. Though we do not expect the resulting regulations to have a material impact on our operations, one new requirement under the Dodd-Frank Act, the requirement for mortgage loan securitizers to retain a portion of the economic risk associated with certain mortgage loans, could impact the type and amount of mortgage loans we offer, depending on the final regulations.
Debit Interchange Fees The Dodd-Frank Act requires that the amount of any interchange fee received by a debit card issuer with respect to debit card transactions be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction.On December 16, 2010, the Federal Reserve released proposed rules implementing this portion of the Dodd-Frank Act, which among other things, would limit interchange fees to no greater than 12 cents for each debit card transaction.The proposal was open for public comment through February 22, 2011, with final rules to be effective on July 21, 2011. If finalized as proposed, the rules could negatively impact revenue from our debit card business.
Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfers of Funds Pursuant to Revised Temporary Addendum to SR Letter 09-4, dated November 17, 2010, we, like all large financial institutions subject to the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program ("SCAP BHCs"), must consult with the Federal Reserve in advance of taking any action that could result in a decreased capital base, including increasing dividends, implementing a common stock repurchase program, or repurchasing capital instruments (planned capital actions). As part of that evaluation, the Federal Reserve, in consultation with primary federal bank regulators, will assess capital adequacy of a SCAP BHC and any planned capital actions based on a review of a comprehensive capital plan submitted by the SCAP BHC. Among other things, the capital plan must incorporate a stress testing framework that considers a range and variety of economic, financial market, and operational events to estimate potential capital needs.
Traditionally, dividends to us from our direct and indirect subsidiaries have represented a major source of funds for us to pay dividends on our stock, make payments on corporate debt securities and meet our other obligations. There are various federal and state law limitations on the extent to which the Banks can finance or otherwise supply funds to us through dividends and loans. These limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements, federal and state banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates, as well as general federal and state regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices. In general, federal and applicable state banking laws prohibit, without first obtaining regulatory approval, insured depository institutions, such as the Banks, from making dividend distributions if such distributions are not paid out of available earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet applicable capital adequacy standards. However, we expect that we may receive a material amount of our funding in the form of dividends from our direct and indirect subsidiaries.
3 Table of Contents Capital Adequacy The Banks are subject to capital adequacy guidelines adopted by federal banking regulators. For a further discussion of the capital adequacy guidelines, see  MD&ALiquidity and Capital ManagementCapital and Note 13Regulatory and Capital Adequacy. The Banks exceeded minimum regulatory requirementsunder these guidelines as of December 31, 2010.
FDICIA and Prompt Corrective Action In general, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) subjects banks to significantly increased regulation and supervision. Among other things, FDICIA requires federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital ratio levels: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. Under applicable regulations, a bank is considered to be well capitalized if it maintains a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6%, a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 5% and is not subject to any supervisory agreement, order, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital reserve. A bank is considered to be adequately capitalized if it maintains a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4%, a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 4% (3% for certain highly rated institutions), and does not otherwise meet the well capitalized definition. The three undercapitalized categories are based upon the amount by which a bank falls below the ratios applicable to adequately capitalized institutions. The capital categories are determined solely for purposes of applying FDICIAs prompt corrective action provisions, and such capital categories may not constitute an accurate representation of the Banks overall financial condition or prospects. As of December 31, 2010, each of the Banks met the requirements for a well-capitalized institution.
As an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions, FDICIA requires regulators to establish certain non-capital safety and soundness standards. The standards relate generally to operations and management, asset quality, interest rate exposure and executive compensation. The agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards.
Heightened Prudentialand Other Requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act With the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, because we are a consolidated bank holding company with consolidated assets of $50 billion or greater, we are subject to certain heightened prudential requirements, including requirements that may be recommended by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the Council) and implemented by the Federal Reserve.As a result, we expect to be subject to more stringent standards and requirements than those applicable for smaller institutions, including risk-based capital requirements, leverage limits, and liquidity requirements.
In addition, we expect to be subject to new requirements regarding risk management, resolution planning (for orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure), credit exposure reporting, and concentration limits. As part of the Dodd-Frank enhanced supervision framework, we will be subject to annual stress tests by the Federal Reserve, and the Company and the Banks will be required to conduct semi-annual stress tests, reporting results to the Federal Reserve and the OCC.
The Council also may issue recommendations to the Federal Reserve orother primary financial regulatory agencyto applynew or heightened standards to risky financial activities or practices.
In addition to the provisions described throughout the Supervision and Regulation section, the Dodd-Frank Act imposes new, more stringent standards and requirements with respect to bank and nonbank acquisitions and mergers, affiliate transactions, and proprietary trading (the Volcker Rule).It is also possible that CONA will be designated as a "swap dealer" under the Dodd-Frank Act, which would result in oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and more requirements for our current and future derivative transactions.The Dodd- Frank Act prohibits conflicts of interest relating to securitizations and generally requires securitizers to retain a 5% economic interest in the credit risk of assets sold through the issuance of asset-backed securitization, with an exemption for traditionally underwritten residential mortgage loans. The Dodd-Frank Act also includes provisions related to corporate governance and executive compensation and new fees and assessments, among others.
The federal agencies have significant discretion in drafting the implementation rules and regulations of the Dodd-Frank Act. As a result, the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act will not be known for many months or, in some cases, years. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires various studies and reports to be delivered to Congress which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action.
Basel II and III Implementation of the international accord on revised risk-based capital rules known as Basel II continues to progress. U.S.Federal banking regulators finalized the Advanced version of Basel II in December 2007 and they issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the Standardized version in June 2008. Neither the Advanced nor Standardized version is mandatory for us, but the Advanced version could become so, due to growth in our reported assets or growth in our reported foreign assets.Alternatively, we might elect to comply with either the Advanced or Standardized versions of Basel II in the future. Compliance might require an increase in the minimum capital that we hold and also require a material investment of resources.We will continue to monitor regulators implementation of the new rules with respect to the institutions that are subject to them and assess the potential impact to us.
In December 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) released proposals for additional capital and liquidity requirements, which have been clarified and amended in recent pronouncements (Basel III).In September 2010, the Basel Committee announced a package of reforms that included detailed capital ratios and capital conservation buffers, subject to transition periods through 2018.In December 2010, the Basel Committee published a final framework on capital and liquidity, consistent in large part with the prior proposals.
The liquidity framework included two standards for liquidity risk supervision, each subject to observation periods and transitional arrangements. One standard promotes short-term resilience by requiring sufficient high-quality liquid assets to survive a stress scenario lasting for 30 days; the other promotes longer-term resilience by requiring sufficient stable funding over a one-year period, based on the liquidity characteristics of assets and activities.
How U.S. banking regulations will be modified to reflect these international standards remains unclear, particularly given the forthcoming capital and other prudential requirement regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act and the current Prompt Corrective Action framework.We expect, however, that minimum capital and liquidity requirements for us and other institutions will increase as a result of Basel III, the Dodd-Frank Act and related activity.We will continue to monitor regulators implementation of the new rules with respect to the institutions that are subject to them and assess the potential impact to us.
4 Table of Contents Deposits and Deposit Insurance Each of the Banks, as an insured depository institution, is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF) maintained by the FDIC. Through the DIF, the FDIC insures the deposits of insured depository institutions up to prescribed limits for each depositor. The DIF was formed on March 31, 2006, upon the merger of the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the Reform Act). The Reform Act permits the FDIC to set a Designated Reserve Ratio (DRR) for the DIF. To maintain the DIF, member institutions may be assessed an insurance premium, and the FDIC may take action to increase insurance premiums if the DRR falls below its required level.
Prior to passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC had established a plan to restore the DIF in the face of recent insurance losses and future loss projections, which resulted in several rules that generally increased deposit insurance rates and purported to improve risk differentiation so that riskier institutions bear a greater share of insurance premiums. The FDIC previously had issued a rule that required banks to prepay on December 31, 2009, their estimated quarterly risk-based assessment for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for 2010, 2011, and 2012. In connection with that rule, we have prepaid approximately $462 million, which is included within Other Assets.
The Dodd-Frank Act reformed the management of the DIF in several ways: (1) raised the minimum DRR to 1.35% (from the former minimum of 1.15%) and removed the upper limit on the DRR; (2) required that the reserve ratio reach 1.35% by September 30, 2020 (rather than 1.15% by the end of 2016); (3) required that in setting assessments, the FDIC must offset the effect of meeting the increased reserve ratio on small insured depository institutions; and (4) eliminated the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends from the DIF when the reserve ratio reaches certain levels.In a recent final rule, the FDIC set the DRR at 2%.The FDIC has proposed, in lieu of dividends, establishing progressively lower assessment rate schedules as the reserve ratio meets certain trigger levels.
The Dodd-Frank Act also required the FDIC to change the deposit insurance assessment base from deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. The FDIC recently finalized rules to implement this change and to significantly modify how deposit insurance assessment rates are calculated for those banks with assets of $10 billion or greater.Absent any actions that management may take to minimize deposit insurance assessments,the Banks assessments will increase significantly starting for the period beginning on April 1, 2011. On October 14, 2008, the FDIC announced its Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), which included the Transaction Account Guarantee Program (TAGP). The TAGP provided unlimited deposit insurance coverage for certain non-interest bearing transaction accounts and very limited interest-bearing accounts held at FDIC-insured depository institutions. The TAGP was originally scheduled to expire on December 31, 2009, but, through several extensions, continued through December 31, 2010 for those institutions that chose to participate.
Banks may accept brokered deposits as part of their funding. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), as discussed in MD&ALiquidity and Capital Management, only well-capitalized and adequately-capitalized institutions may accept brokered deposits. Adequately-capitalized institutions, however, must first obtain a waiver from the FDIC before accepting brokered deposits, and such deposits may not pay rates that significantly exceed the rates paid on deposits of similar maturity from the institutions normal market area or, for deposits from outside the institutions normal market area, the national rate on deposits of comparable maturity.
The FDIC is authorized to terminate a banks deposit insurance upon a finding by the FDIC that the banks financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the banks regulatory agency. The termination of deposit insurance for a bank could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and its earnings.
Overdraft Protection The Federal Reserve amended Regulation E on November 12, 2009, to limit the ability to assess overdraft fees for paying ATM and one-time debit card transactions that overdraw a consumers account, unless the consumer opts in to such payment of overdrafts. The new rule does not apply to overdraft services with respect to checks, ACH transactions, or recurring debit card transactions, or to the payment of overdrafts pursuant to a line of credit or a service that transfers funds from another account. We are required to provide to customers written notice describing our overdraft service, fees imposed and other information, and to provide customers with a reasonable opportunity to opt in to the service. Before we may assess fees for paying discretionary overdrafts, a customer must affirmatively opt in, which could negatively impact our deposit business revenue.The new rule was effective for all new accounts opened on or after July 1, 2010, and on August 15, 2010, it became effective for accounts opened prior to July 1, 2010.
5 Table of Contents Source of Strength and Liability for Commonly-Controlled Institutions Under the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, a bank holding company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks (the so-called source of strength doctrine).The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine, directing the Federal Reserve to require bank holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks.
Under the cross-guarantee provision of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), insured depository institutions such as the Banks may be liable to the FDIC with respect to any loss incurred, or reasonably anticipated to be incurred, by the FDIC in connection with the default of, or FDIC assistance to, any commonly controlled insured depository institution. The Banks are commonly controlled within the meaning of the FIRREA cross-guarantee provision.
FDIC Orderly Liquidation Authority The Dodd-Frank Act provided the FDIC with liquidation authority that may be used to liquidate a financial company if the Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President, based on the recommendation of the Federal Reserve and another federal agency, determines that doing so is necessary to mitigate serious adverse effects on U.S. financial stability.Upon such a determination, the FDIC would be appointed receiver and must liquidate the company in a way that mitigates significant risks to financial stability and minimizes moral hazard.The costs of a liquidation of a financial company would be borne by shareholders and unsecured creditors and then, if necessary, by risk-based assessments on large financial companies.The FDIC is issuing rules implementing this authority.
FFIEC Account Management Guidance On January 8, 2003, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) released Account Management and Loss Allowance Guidance (the Guidance). The Guidance applies to all credit lending of regulated financial institutions and generally requires that banks properly manage several elements of their lending programs, including line assignments, over-limit practices, minimum payment and negative amortization, workout and settlement programs, and the accounting methodology used for various assets and income items related to loans.
We believe that our account management and loss allowance practices are prudent and appropriate and, therefore, consistent with the Guidance. We caution, however, the Guidance provides wide discretion to bank regulatory agencies in the application of the Guidance to any particular institution and its account management and loss allowance practices. Accordingly, under the Guidance, bank examiners could require changes in our account management or loss allowance practices in the future, and such changes could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operation.
Privacy and Fair Credit Reporting The GLBA requires a financial institution to describe in a privacy notice certain of its privacy and data collection practices and requires that customers or consumers, before their nonpublic personal information is shared, be given a choice (through an opt-out notice) to limit the sharing of such information about them with nonaffiliated third parties unless the sharing is required or permitted under the GLBA as implemented. We and the Banks have written privacy notices that are available through our website, the relevant legal entity or both, and are delivered to consumers and customers when required under the GLBA. In accordance with the privacy notices noted above, we and the Banks protect the security of information about our customers, educate our employees about the importance of protecting customer privacy and allow our customers to remove their names from the solicitation lists used and shared with others by us and the Banks to the extent they use or share such lists. We and the Banks require business partners with whom we share such information to have adequate security safeguards and to abide by the redisclosure and reuse provisions of the GLBA. To the extent that the GLBA and the FCRA require us or one or more of the Banks to provide customers and consumers the opportunity to opt out of sharing information, then the relevant entity or entities provide such options in the privacy notice. In addition to adopting federal requirements regarding privacy, the GLBA also permits individual states to enact stricter laws relating to the use of customer information. To date, at least California and Vermont have done so by statute, regulation or referendum, and other states may consider proposals which impose additional requirements or restrictions on us or the Banks. If the federal or state regulators of the financial subsidiaries establish further guidelines for addressing customer privacy issues, we or one or more of the Banks may need to amend our privacy policies and adapt our internal procedures.
Under Section 501(b) of the GLBA, among other sources of statutory authority, including state law, the Banks and us are required to observe various data security-related requirements, including establishing information security and data security breach response programs and properly authenticating customers before processing or enabling certain types of transactions or interactions. The failure to observe any one or more of these requirements could subject the Banks or us to enforcement action or litigation.
6 Table of Contents Like other lending institutions, the Banks utilize credit bureau data in their underwriting activities. Use of such data is regulated under the FCRA on a uniform, nationwide basis, including credit reporting, prescreening, sharing of information between affiliates, and the use of credit data. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (the FACT Act), which was enacted by Congress and signed into law in December 2003, extends the federal preemption of the FCRA permanently, although the law authorizes states to enact laws regulating certain subject matters so long as they are not inconsistent with the conduct required by the FCRA. If financial institutions and credit bureaus fail to alleviate the costs and consumer frustration associated with the growing crime of identity theft, financial institutions could face increased legislative/regulatory and litigation risks.
Investment in the Company and the Banks Certain acquisitions of our capital stock may be subject to regulatory approval or notice under federal or state law. Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire shares of our capital stock in excess of the amount which can be acquired without regulatory approval. Each of the Banks is an insured depository institution within the meaning of the Change in Bank Control Act. Consequently, federal law and regulations prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of us without, in most cases, prior written approval of the Federal Reserve or the OCC, as applicable. Control is conclusively presumed if, among other things, a person or company acquires more than 25% of any class of our voting stock. A rebuttable presumption of control arises if a person or company acquires more than 10% of any class of voting stock and is subject to any of a number of specified control factors as set forth in the applicable regulations. Additionally, COBNA and CONA are banks within the meaning of Chapter 13 of Title 6.1 of the Code of Virginia governing the acquisition of interests in Virginia financial institutions (the Financial Institution Holding Company Act). The Financial Institution Holding Company Act prohibits any person or entity from acquiring, or making any public offer to acquire, control of a Virginia financial institution or its holding company without making application to, and receiving prior approval from, the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions.
Non-Bank Activities Our non-bank subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various other federal and state authorities. Insurance agency subsidiaries are regulated by state insurance regulatory agencies in the states in which we operate. Capital One Agency LLC is a licensed insurance agency that is regulated by the New York State Insurance Department in its home state and by the state insurance regulatory agencies in the states in which it operates. Capital One Agency LLC provides both personal and business insurance services to retail and commercial clients.
Capital One Investment Services LLC and Capital One Southcoast Capital, Inc., are registered broker-dealers regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to, among other things, net capital rules designed to measure the general financial condition and liquidity of a broker-dealer. Under these rules, broker-dealers are required to maintain the minimum net capital deemed necessary to meet their continuing commitments to customers and others, and are required to keep a substantial portion of their assets in relatively liquid form. These rules also limit the ability of broker-dealers to transfer capital to parent companies and other affiliates. Broker-dealers are also subject to other regulations covering their business operations, including sales and trading practices, public offerings, publication of research reports, use and safekeeping of client funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.
Capital One Asset Management LLC, which provides investment advice to institutions, foundations, endowments, and high net worth individuals, is a registered investment adviser regulated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.Capital One Financial Advisors LLC is a New York-state registered investment adviser.
USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act) contains sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws as well as enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanisms for the U.S. government, including:due diligence requirements for private banking and correspondent accounts; standards for verifying customer identification at account opening; rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering; reporting requirements applicable to the receipt of coins and currency of more than $10,000 in nonfinancial trades or businesses; and more broadly applicable suspicious activity reporting requirements.
7 Table of Contents The Department of Treasury, in consultation with the Federal Reserve and other federal financial institution regulators, has promulgated rules and regulations implementing the Patriot Act that prohibit correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks at U.S. financial institutions; require financial institutions to maintain certain records relating to correspondent accounts for foreign banks; require financial institutions to produce certain records upon request of the appropriate federal banking agency; require due diligence with respect to private banking and correspondent banking accounts; facilitate information sharing between government and financial institutions; require verification of customer identification; and require financial institutions to have an anti-money laundering program in place.
Regulation of International Business by NonU.S. Authorities COBNA is subject to regulation in foreign jurisdictions where it operates, currently in the U.K. and Canada.
In the United Kingdom, COBNA operates through COEP, which was established in 2000. Effective December 1, 2010, COEP became an authorized payment institution by the Financial Services Authority (the FSA) under the Payment Services Regulations 2009.This change involved a variation of COEPs permissions to conduct certain regulated activities in the U.K. (notably cancellation of its permission to accept deposits, which permission had been retained following COEPs transfer of its savings business in 2009).To facilitate the change, ownership of COEPs immediate parent companies (Capital One Holdings Limited and Capital One Investments Limited, both U.K. entities) was transferred from COBNA to Capital One Global Corporation (a new Virginia-chartered corporation), all the shares of which are owned by COBNA.Capital One Global Corporation is subject to regulation as an agreement corporation under the Federal Reserves Regulation K.
During 2010, the U.K. Government announced plans to change the structure of financial regulation by the end of 2012. As part of this change, the FSA will cease to exist in its current form. The Government will create a new Prudential Regulatory Authority (the PRA), responsible for the day-to-day prudential supervision of financial institutions, and a new Financial Policy Committee (the FPC), which will look across the economy at the macroeconomic and financial issues that may threaten stability and address the risks it identifies. In addition, a new Consumer Protection and Markets Authority (the CPMA) will also be established, responsible for the conduct of all financial services firms. A shadow structure is expected to be built during 2011 in preparation for the changes while the Government consults on detailed proposals. This consultation activity includes consideration of whether the U.K. consumer credit regime currently regulated by the Office of Fair Trading (the OFT) should become the responsibility of the new CPMA.
Following a review of the credit card industry by the U.K. Government in late 2009, the industry and U.K. Government announced a joint commitment to a package of measures that has been incorporated into the U.K.s Lending Code. The key measures include allocating customer payments to higher rate balances first; setting minimum payments on new customer accounts to cover at least interest, fees, charges and 1% of the principal balance; creating the option for customers to opt out of unsolicited credit limit increases and to request reductions in their credit line; providing additional communication over re-pricing of existing debt and allowing customers to opt out of the increase and pay down their balance at the existing rate; and providing annual electronic statements to customers regarding the cost to use a credit card over the year.It is still under discussion as to when this final standard regarding annual statements will be implemented.
The U.K. Government has also passed the Financial Services Act 2010 which restricts the issuance of unsolicited credit card checks. This provision of the Act will now come into effect through voluntary self-regulation, rather than proceeding with the commencement order for this legislation, with the changes being reflected in the next edition of the Lending Code, due to be published in March 2011. Lenders agreed to be fully compliant with these provisions by the end of 2010, in line with the other commitments that were agreed with the U.K. Government.
Following the passing of the Consumer Credit Directive (the CCD) in May 2008 by the European Commission (the EC), the U.K. consumer credit regime, including the laws and regulations with respect to the marketing of consumer credit products and the design of and disclosure in consumer credit agreements, is due to change significantly. The CCD is also introducing new regulations that require certain information be provided to consumers before a credit agreement is entered into and that provide explicit requirements designed to ensure that any such consumer is creditworthy. The new law enacted in the U.K. to implement the CCD became fully effective on February 1, 2011, but lenders could voluntarily comply with the legislation, with the exception of the new advertising rules, starting April 30, 2010.
Cross-border interchange fees are under scrutiny from the EC. The timing of any final resolution of the matter by the EC or the OFT, which has suspended its own investigation into domestic interchange, is uncertain, but it is anticipated that the OFT will await the outcome of the EC court decision before concluding its own investigation.
8 Table of Contents Following a referral by the OFT, the Competition Commission (the CC) launched a market investigation into the supply of Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) in the U.K. PPI on mortgages, credit cards, unsecured loans (personal loans, motor loans and hire purchase) and secured loans is included. The CC published its final report on remedies, which included point of sale prohibition, in October 2010, with the draft Order setting out the detail of the remedies published for consultation in November 2010. COEP responded to the consultation and is currently assessing the impact of the proposed new remedies. The final Order is expected in late March/early April 2011.
New rules on PPI complaints handling and redress were published by the FSA in August 2010 and came into force in December 2010. The British Bankers Association has issued judicial review proceedings to challenge the validity of the new rules on the basis that the new rules have retrospective effect. The implementation of the new rules and the outcome of judicial review proceedings may have a material effect on COEPs PPI complaints handling.
In Canada, COBNA operates as an authorized foreign bank pursuant to the Bank Act (Canada) (the Bank Act) and is permitted to conduct its credit card business in Canada through its Canadian branch, Capital One Bank (Canada Branch) (Capital One Canada). The primary regulator of Capital One Canada is the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI). Other regulators include the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, and the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada. Capital One Canada is subject to regulation under various Canadian federal laws, including the Bank Act and its regulations, noted more fully below, and the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.
In 2010, new consumer disclosure and business practices regulations affecting credit cards issued by federally regulated financial institutions in Canada became effective. These regulations, issued pursuant to the Bank Act, established new requirements under the Cost of Borrowing (Authorized Foreign Banks) Regulations and introduced the Credit Business Practices (Banks, Authorized Foreign Banks, Trust and Loan Companies, Retail Associations, Canadian Insurance Companies and Foreign Insurance Companies) Regulations. Among the new requirements are standardized summary "information box" disclosures for applications and credit agreements, increased disclosure for monthly statements as well as for a minimum 21-day grace period and related requirements. New business practices requirements impose restrictions on the allocation of payments made in excess of the required monthly minimum payment, credit limit increases, and collections practices. These amendments could increase our operational and compliance costs and affect the types and terms of products that we offer in Canada.
COMPETITION As a diversified financial institution that markets credit cards and consumer and commercial financial products and services, we operate in a highly competitive environment and face competition in all aspects of our business from numerous bank and non-bank providers of financial services.We compete with national and state banks for deposits, commercial loans and trust accounts and with savings and loan associations and credit unions for loans and deposits. Our competitors also include other financial services providers that provide loans, deposits, and other similar services and product.In addition, we compete against non-depository institutions that are able to offer these products and services.
We compete with international, national, regional and local issuers of Visa  and MasterCard  credit cards, as well as with American Express  , Discover Card  and, to a certain extent, debit cards. In general, customers are attracted to credit card issuers largely on the basis of price, credit limit and other product features, and customer loyalty is often limited.In our auto finance business, we face competition from banks and non-bank lenders who provide financing for dealer-originated loans.
Our businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and range of their products and services, transaction execution, innovation and price.Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served.With respect to some of our products and geographies and products, we compete globally and with respect to others, we compete on a regional basis.Our ability to compete depends on our ability to attract and retain our professional and other associates and on our reputation.In the current environment, customers are generally attracted to depository institutions that are perceived as stable, with solid liquidity and funding.
We believe that we are able to compete effectively in our current markets. There can be no assurance, however, that our ability to market products and services successfully or to obtain adequate returns on our products and services will not be impacted by the nature of the competition that now exists or may later develop, or by the broader economic environment. For a discussion of the risks related to our competitive environment, please refer to Item1A.Risk Factors.
EMPLOYEES A central part of our philosophy is to attract and retain a highly capable staff. We employed approximately 27,826 employees, whom we refer to as associates, as of December 31, 2010. We view current associate relations to be satisfactory, and none of our associates is covered under a collective bargaining agreement.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Geographic Diversity Our consumer loan portfolios, including credit cards, are diversified across the United States with modest concentration in New York, New Jersey, Louisiana, and Texas. We also have credit card loans in the U.K. and Canada. Our commercial loans are concentrated in New York, New Jersey, Louisiana and Texas. SeeMD&ARisk Management and Note 22Significant Concentration of Credit Risk for additional information.
Technology/Systems We leverage information technology to achieve our business objectives and to develop and deliver products and services that satisfy our customers needs. A key part of our strategic focus is the development of efficient, flexible computer and operational systems to support complex marketing and account management strategies, the servicing of our customers, and the development of new and diversified products. We believe that the continued development and integration of these systems is an important part of our efforts to reduce costs, improve quality and provide faster, more flexible technology services. Consequently, we continuously review capabilities and develop or acquire systems, processes and competencies to meet our unique business requirements.
9 Table of Contents As part of our continuous efforts to review and improve our technologies, we may either develop such capabilities internally or rely on third party outsourcers who have the ability to deliver technology that is of higher quality, lower cost, or both. Over time, we have increasingly relied on third party outsourcers to help us deliver systems and operational infrastructure. These relationships include (but are not limited to): Total System Services Inc.(TSYS)for processing services forCapital OnesNorth American and United Kingdom portfolios of consumer and small business credit card accounts, Fidelity National Information Services (Fidelity) for the Capital One banking systems, and IBM Corporation for management of our North American data centers.
Intellectual Property As part of our overall and ongoing strategy to protect and enhance our intellectual property, we rely on a variety of protections, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents and certain restrictions on disclosure, solicitation, and competition. We also undertake other measures to control access to and distribution of our other proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use certain intellectual property or proprietary information without authorization. Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information. In addition, our competitors and other third parties also file patent applications for innovations that are used in our industry. The ability of our competitors and other third parties to obtain such patents may adversely affect our ability to compete. Conversely, our ability to obtain such patents may increase our competitive advantage. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in such efforts, or that the ability of our competitors to obtain such patents may not adversely impact our financial results.
FORWARD -LOOKING STATEMENTS From time to time, we have made and will make forward-looking statements, including those that discuss, among other things, strategies, goals, outlook or other non-historical matters; projections, revenues, income, returns, accruals for claims in litigation and for other claims against us; earnings per share or other financial measures for us; future financial and operating results; our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions; and the assumptions that underlie these matters.

Item 1A.
Risk Factors BUSINESS RISKS This section highlights specific risks that could affect our business. Although we have tried to discuss all material risks at the time this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been filed, please be aware that other risks may prove to be important in the future. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, among the other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward looking statements are the following: The Current Business Environment, Including A Prolonged Economic Recovery, May Adversely Affect Our Industry, Business, Results Of Operations And Capital Levels The recent global recession has resulted in a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, reduced asset values (including residential and commercial properties), reduced business profits, increased rates of business and consumer delinquency, and increased rates of unemployment and consumer bankruptcy, some of which have had a negative impact on our results of operation. Although the overall economic recovery seems to be underway, it has remained modest and fragile.A recovery that is only shallow and very gradual, marked by continued elevated unemployment rates and reduced home prices, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as customers default on their loans or maintain lower deposit levels or, in the case of credit card accounts, carry lower balances and reduce credit card purchase activity.
In particular, we may face the following risks in connection with these events:  Adverse macroeconomic developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. In addition, changes in consumer behavior, including decreased consumer spending and a shift in consumer payment strategies towards avoiding late fees, over-limit fees, finance charges and other fees, could have an adverse impact on our revenues.
11 Table of Contents  Increases in consumer bankruptcies could cause increases in our charge-off rates, which could have a negative impact on our revenues.
Our ability to recover debt that we have previously charged-off may be limited, which could have a negative impact on our revenues.
The processes we use to estimate inherent losses may no longer be reliable because these processes rely on complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation, which could have a negative impact on our business.
Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the criteria or models we use to underwrite and manage our customers become less predictive of future losses, which could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations.
Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in funding transactions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations, which could limit our access to funding.
Increased charge-offs, rising LIBOR and other events may cause our securitization transactions to amortize earlier than scheduled, which could accelerate our need for additional funding from other sources.
We have increased our reliance on deposit funding, and an inability to accept or maintain deposits or to obtain other sources of funding could materially affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business. Many other financial institutions have also increased their reliance on deposit funding and, as such, we expect continued competition in the deposit markets. We cannot predict how this competition will affect our costs. If we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted.
Regulators, rating agencies or investors could change their standards regarding appropriate capital levels for banks in general or our company in particular. If the new standards call for capital levels higher than the capital we have or that we anticipate, it could have negative impacts on our ability to lend or to grow deposits and on our business results.
Increased prepayments, refinancing or other factors could lead to a reduction in the value of our mortgage servicing rights, which could have a negative impact on our financial results.
Compliance With New And Existing Laws And Regulations May Increase Our Costs, Reduce Our Revenue, Limit Our Ability To Pursue Business Opportunities, And Increase Compliance Challenges There has been increased legislation and regulation with respect to the financial services industry in the last few years, and we expect that oversight of our business will continue to expand in scope and complexity. A wide and increasing array of banking, consumer lending and deposit laws apply to almost every aspect of our business. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in financial, structural and operational penalties, including receivership. In addition, establishing systems and processes to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations may increase our costs or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.
The Credit CARD Act (amending the Truth-in-Lending Act) and related changes to Regulation Z impose a number of restrictions on credit card practices impacting rates and fees and also update the disclosures required for open-end credit.For example, increases in rates charged on pre-existing card balances are restricted, and rates increased since January 1, 2009, must now be considered for possible reductions.Overlimit fees may not be imposed without prior consent of the customer, and the number of such fees that can be charged for the same violation is constrained.The amount of any penalty fee or charge must be reasonable and proportional to the violation. Although we did not engage in many of the practices prohibited by the amendments, the rules could have a material adverse effect on future revenues in our U.S. credit card business and could make the card business generally less resilient in future economic downturns.
In July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act.The Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the related rules and regulations adopted by various regulatory agencies, could have a significant adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.There are a number of provisions in the Dodd-Frank act that impact our business, including the following:  The Dodd-Frank Act created a new independent supervisory body, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB) that is to be housed within the Federal Reserve. The CFPB will become the primary regulator for federal consumer financial statutes. State attorneys general will be authorized to enforce new regulations issued by the CFPB. Although state consumer financial laws will continue to be preempted under the National Bank Act under the existing standard set forth in the Supreme Court decision in Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson , OCC determinations of such preemption must be on a case-by-case basis.Courts reviewing the OCC's preemption determinations will now consider the appropriateness of those determinations under a different standard of judicial review. As a result, state consumer financial laws enacted in the future may be held to apply to our business activities.The cost of complying with these additional laws could have a negative impact on our financial results.
12 Table of Contents  The Dodd-Frank Act requires that the amount of any interchange fee received by a debit card issuer with respect to debit card transactions be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction. On December 16, 2010, the Federal Reserve released proposed rules implementing this portion of the Dodd-Frank Act, which among other things, would limit interchange fees to no greater than 12 cents for each debit card transaction. If finalized as proposed, the rules could negatively impact revenue from our debit card business.The issue of interchange generally will continue to be raised by legislators at the state and Federal level.While the future of these proposals is uncertain, if negative legislation is enacted, any subsequent negotiations with merchants could reduce the interchange fees that we are able to collect.
The Dodd-Frank Act contains a number of other provisions that will impact our business.For example, the Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to change the deposit insurance assessment base from deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. The FDIC recently finalized rules to implement this change and to modify significantly how deposit insurance assessment rates are calculated for those banks with assets of $10 billion or greater.In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, many trust preferred securities will cease to qualify for Tier 1 capital, subject to a three year phase-out period expected to begin in 2013.And the Dodd-Frank Act will most likely subject us to the supervision of regulatory agencies that historically have not regulated our businesses, such as the CommodityFutures Trading Commission with respect to our derivatives activities .These provisions could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition by increasing our cost of funding, our cost of capital or our cost of complying with applicable laws and regulations.
Certain laws and regulations, and any interpretations and applications with respect thereto, may benefit consumers, borrowers and depositors, but not stockholders. The legislative and regulatory environment is beyond our control, may change rapidly and unpredictably and may negatively influence our revenue, costs, earnings, growth and capital levels. Our success depends on our ability to maintain compliance with both existing and new laws and regulations. For a description of the laws and regulations to which we are subject, please refer to Supervision and Regulation in Item 1.Business.
We May Experience Increased Delinquencies And Credit Losses Like other lenders, we face the risk that our customers will not repay their loans. Rising losses or leading indicators of rising losses (such as higher delinquencies, higher rates of non-performing loans, higher bankruptcy rates, lower collateral values or elevated unemployment rates) may require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses, which may degrade our profitability if we are unable to raise revenue or reduce costs to compensate for higher losses. In particular, we face the following risks in this area:  Missed Payments . Our customers may miss payments. Loan charge-offs (including from bankruptcies) are generally preceded by missed payments or other indications of worsening financial condition. Our reported delinquency levels measure these trends. Customers are more likely to miss payments during an economic downturn or prolonged periods of slow economic growth. In addition, we face the risk that consumer and commercial customer behavior may change (for example, an increase in the unwillingness or inability of customers to repay debt), causing a long-term rise in delinquencies and charge-offs.
Estimates of Inherent losses . The credit quality of our portfolio can have a significant impact on our earnings. We allow for and reserve against credit risks based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolios. This process, which is critical to our financial results and condition, requires complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions. We may underestimate our inherent losses and fail to hold a loan loss allowance sufficient to account for these losses. Incorrect assumptions could lead to material underestimates of inherent losses and inadequate allowance for loan and lease losses. In addition, our estimate of inherent losses impacts the amount of allowances we build to account for those losses. The increase or release of allowances impacts our current financial results.
Underwriting.
Our ability to assess the credit worthiness of our customers may diminish. If the models and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite our consumer and commercial customers become less predictive of future charge-offs (due, for example, to rapid changes in the economy, including the unemployment rate), our credit losses may increase and our returns may deteriorate.
13 Table of Contents  Business Mix . Our business mix could change in ways that could adversely affect credit losses. We participate in a mix of businesses with a broad range of credit loss characteristics. Consequently, changes in our business mix may change our charge-off rate.
Charge-off Recognition . The rules governing charge-off recognition could change. We record charge-offs according to accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules. These guidelines and rules, including the FFIEC Account Management Guidance, could require changes in our account management or loss allowance practices and cause our charge-offs to increase for reasons unrelated to the underlying performance of our portfolio. Such changes could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operation.
Industry Practices . Our charge-off and delinquency rates may be negatively impacted by industry developments, including new regulations applicable to our industry.
Collateral.
Collateral, when we have it, could be insufficient to compensate us for loan losses. When customers default on their loans and we have collateral, we attempt to seize it where permissible and appropriate. However, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan, and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from our customers. Particularly with respect to our commercial lending and home loan activities, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for our loans and investments. Thus, the recovery of such property could be insufficient to compensate us for the value of these loans.
New York Concentration.
Although our lending is geographically diversified, approximately 45% of our commercial loan portfolio is concentrated in the New York metropolitan area. The regional economic conditions in the New York area affect the demand for our commercial products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay their commercial loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. A prolonged decline in the general economic conditions in the New York region could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our commercial loan portfolio and our results of operations.
We May Experience Increased Losses Associated With Mortgage Repurchases and Indemnification Obligations Certain of our subsidiaries, including GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. ("GreenPoint"), Capital One Home Loansand CONA, as successor to Chevy Chase Bank, may be required to repurchase mortgage loans that have been sold to investors in the event there are certain breaches of certain representations and warranties contained within the sales agreements. We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans that we sell to investors in the event that there was improper underwriting or fraud or in the event that the loans become delinquent shortly after they are originated. These subsidiaries also may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur in the event of breaches of representations and warranties and in various other circumstances, and the amount of such losses could exceed the repurchase amount of the related loans. Consequently, we may be exposed to credit risk associated with sold loans. We have established a reserve in our consolidated financial statements for potential losses that are considered to be both probable and reasonably estimable related to the mortgage loans sold by our originating subsidiaries. The adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred will depend on, among other things, the actual future mortgage loan performance, the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests, the actual success rate of claimants, developments in litigation related to us and the industry, actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices). Due to uncertainties relating to these factors, there can be no assurance that our reserves will be adequate or that the total amount of losses incurred will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. For additional information related to our mortgage loan repurchase and indemnification obligations and related reserves, see MD&A  Consolidated Balance Sheet Analysis and Credit Performance  Potential Mortgage Representation and Warranty Liabilities.
We May Not Be Able to Maintain Adequate Capital Levels or Liquidity, Which Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Financial Results As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and international accords, financial institutions will become subject to new and increased capital and liquidity requirements. While it is not yet clear what form these requirements will take or how they will apply to us, it is possible that we could be required to increase our capital levels above the levels in our current financial plans. These new requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to lend, grow deposit balances or make acquisitions and on our ability to make capital distributions in the form of increased dividends or share repurchases.Higher capital levels could also lower our return on equity.
Recent developments in capital and liquidity requirements that may impact us include the following:  In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published a final framework (commonly known as Basel III) on capital and liquidity . The key elements of the capital proposal include raising the quality, consistency and transparency of the capital base, strengthening the risk coverage of the capital framework, introducing a leverage ratio that is different from the U.S. leverage ratio measures and promoting the build-up of capital buffers.
The liquidity framework includes two standards for liquidity risk supervision, one standard promoting short-term resilience and the other promoting longer-term resilience.
How U.S. banking regulations will be modified to reflect these international standards remains unclear, particularly given the forthcoming capital and other prudential requirement regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act and the current Prompt Corrective Action framework.We expect, however, that minimum capital and liquidity requirements for the Company and other institutions will increase as a result of Basel III, the Dodd-Frank Act and related activity.
14 Table of Contents  Because we are a consolidated bank holding company with consolidated assets of $50 billion or greater, we are subject to certain heightened prudential requirements, including requirements that may be recommended by the Financial Stability Oversight Council and implemented by the Federal Reserve.
As a result, we expect to be subject to more stringent standards and requirements than those applicable for smaller institutions, including risk-based capital requirements, leverage limits and liquidity requirements.
See "Item 1. BusinessSupervision and RegulationCapital Adequacy" for additional information.
We Face Risk Related To The Strength Of Our Operational, Technological And Organizational Infrastructure Our ability to grow and compete is dependent on our ability to build or acquire the necessary operational, technological and organizational infrastructure. We have substantially completed significant development projects to complete the systems integration of Chevy Chase Bank and to build a scalable banking infrastructure. Implementation of such infrastructure changes and upgrades may, at least temporarily, cause disruptions to our business, including, but not limited to, systems interruptions, transaction processing errors and system conversion delays, all of which could have a negative impact on us.
Similar to other large corporations, we are exposed to operational risk that can manifest itself in many ways, such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes, faulty or disabled computer systems, fraud by employees or persons outside of our company and exposure to external events. In addition, we are heavily dependent on the strength and capability of our technology systems which we use to manage our internal financial and other systems, interface with our customers and develop and implement effective marketing campaigns. Our ability to develop and deliver new products that meet the needs of our existing customers and attract new ones and to run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations depends on the functionality of our operational and technology systems. Any disruptions or failures of our operational and technology systems, including those associated with improvements or modifications to such systems, could cause us to be unable to market and manage our products and services or to report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner, all of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
In some cases, we outsource the maintenance and development of our operational and technological functionality to third parties. These third parties may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control. Any increase in the amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to third parties may increase our exposure to these risks.
We May Fail To Realize All Of The Anticipated Benefits Of Our Mergers And Acquisitions We have engaged in merger and acquisition activity over the past several years and may continue to engage in such activity in the future. If we are not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of such mergers and acquisitions, including cost savings and other synergies, our business could be negatively affected. In addition, it is possible that the ongoing integration processes could result in the loss of key employees, errors or delays in systems implementation, the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger or acquisition. Integration efforts also may divert management attention and resources. These integration matters may have an adverse effect on us during any transition period.
Our acquisitions also may involve our entry into new businesses and new geographic or other markets which present risks resulting from our relative inexperience in these new areas or these new businesses. These new businesses change the overall character of our consolidated portfolio of businesses and could react differently to economic and other external factors. We face the risk that we will not be successful in these new businesses or in these new markets.
We Face the Risk of Fluctuations in Our Expenses and Other Costs That May Hurt Our Financial Results Our expenses and other costs, such as operating, labor and marketing expenses, directly affect our earnings results. In light of the extremely competitive environment in which we operate, and because the size and scale of many of our competitors provide them with increased operational efficiencies, it is important that we are able to successfully manage our expenses. Many factors can influence the amount of our expenses, as well as how quickly they may increase. Our on-going investments in infrastructure, which may be necessary to maintain a competitive business, integrate newly-acquired businesses and establish scalable operations, may increase our expenses. In addition, as our business develops, changes or expands, additional expenses can arise as a result of a reevaluation of business strategies, management of outsourced services, asset purchases or other acquisitions, structural reorganization, compliance with new laws or regulations or the integration of newly acquired businesses. If we are unable to successfully manage our expenses, our financial results will be negatively affected.
Reputational Risk and Social Factors May Impact Our Results Our ability to originate and maintain accounts is highly dependent upon the perceptions of consumer and commercial borrowers and deposit holders and other external perceptions of our business practices or our financial health. Adverse perceptions regarding our reputation in the consumer, commercial and funding markets could lead to difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them. Particularly, negative perceptions regarding our reputation could lead to decreases in the levels of deposits that consumer and commercial customers and potential customers choose to maintain with us.
In addition, a variety of social factors may cause changes in borrowing activity, including credit card use, payment patterns and the rate of defaults by accountholders and borrowers domestically and internationally. These social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels, the publics perception regarding consumer debt, including credit card use, and changing attitudes about the stigma of personal bankruptcy. If consumers develop negative attitudes about incurring debt or if consumption trends continue to decline, our business and financial results will be negatively affected.
We Face Intense Competition in All of Our Markets We operate in a highly competitive environment, and we expect competitive conditions to continue to intensify. In such a competitive environment, we may lose entire accounts or may lose account balances to competing financial institutions, or we may find it more costly to maintain our existing customer base. Customer attrition from any or all of our lending products, together with any lowering of interest rates or fees that we might implement to retain customers, could reduce our revenues and therefore our earnings. Similarly, customer attrition from our deposit products, in addition to an increase in rates or services that we may offer to retain those deposits, may increase our expenses and therefore reduce our earnings. We expect that competition will continue to increase with respect to most of our products. Some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, which may give those competitors advantages, including a more diversified product and customer base, the ability to reach out to more customers and potential customers, operational efficiencies, more versatile technology platforms, broad-based local distribution capabilities, lower-cost funding and larger existing branch networks. In addition, some of our competitors are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject, which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage.
15 Table of Contents Fluctuations in Market Interest Rates Or the Capital Markets Could Adversely Affect Our Revenue and Expense, the Value of Assets and Obligations, Our Cost of Capital or Our Liquidity Like other financial institutions, our business may be sensitive to market interest rate movement and the performance of the financial markets. Changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact us. For example, we borrow money from other institutions and depositors, which we use to make loans to customers and invest in debt securities and other earning assets. We earn interest on these loans and assets and pay interest on the money we borrow from institutions and depositors. Fluctuations in interest rates, including changes in the relationship between short-term rates and long-term rates and in the relationship between our funding basis rate and our lending basis rate, may have negative impacts on our net interest income and therefore our earnings. In addition, interest rate fluctuations and competitor responses to those changes may effect the rate of customer pre-payments for mortgage, auto and other term loans and may affect the balances customers carry on their credit cards. These changes can reduce the overall yield on our earning asset portfolio. Changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain balances in the deposit accounts they have with us. In addition, changes in valuations in the debt and equity markets could have a negative impact on the assets we hold in our investment portfolio. Finally, such market changes could also have a negative impact on the valuation of assets for which we provide servicing.
We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction and the magnitude of interest rate changes. We take risk mitigation actions based on those assessments. We face the risk that changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and our earnings in material amounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than those we assumed.See MD&AMarket Risk Management for additional information.
Our Business Could Be Negatively Affected If It Is Unable to Attract, Retain and Motivate Skilled Senior Leaders Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain key senior leaders, and competition for such senior leaders can be intense in most areas of our business. The executive compensation provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations issued thereunder, and any further legislation or regulation restricting executive compensation, may limit the types of compensation arrangements that we may enter into with our most senior leaders and could have a negative impact on our ability to attract, retain and motivate such leaders in support of our long-term strategy. These laws and regulations may not apply in the same manner to all financial institutions, and we therefore may face more restrictions than other institutions and companies with whom we compete for talent. If we are unable to retain talented senior leadership, our business could be negatively affected.
Our Businesses are Subject to the Risk of Increased Litigation Our businesses are subject to increased litigation as a result of the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry and the structure of the credit card industry, and we face risks from the outcomes of such industry litigation. Substantial legal liability against us could have a material adverse effect or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously harm our business. Fora description of the litigation risks that we face, see Note 21  Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees.
We Face Risks from Unpredictable Catastrophic Events Despite our substantial business contingency plans, the impact from natural disasters and other catastrophic events, including terrorist attacks, may have a negative effect on our business and infrastructure, including our information technology systems. The impact of such events and other catastrophes on the overall economy may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
We Face Risks from the Use of Estimates in Our Financial Statements Pursuant to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including, but not limited to, estimating our allowance for loan and lease losses and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities.If the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience unexpected material losses. For a discussion of our use of estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

18 Table of Contents Item 6.Selected Financial Data We prepare our consolidated financial statements using generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP), which we refer to as our reported results.Below we present selected consolidated financial data from our reported results of operations for the five-year period ended December 31, 2010, as well as selected consolidated balance sheet data as of the end of each year within this five-year period.
Prior to January 1, 2010, we also presented and analyzed our results on a non-GAAP managed basis.Our managed presentation assumed that securitized loans accounted for as sales and reported as off-balance sheet in accordance with applicable accounting guidance in effect prior to January 1, 2010, remained on balance sheet, and the earnings from the loans underlying these trusts are reported in our results of operations in the same manner as the earnings from loans that we own.While our managed presentation resulted in differences in the classification of revenues in our income statement, net income on a managed basis was the same as reported net income.
Effective January 1, 2010, we prospectively adopted two new accounting standards that resulted in the consolidation of a substantial portion of our securitization trusts.As a result of the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards, our reported and managed basis presentations are generally comparable for periods beginning after January 1, 2010.We provide information on the impact from the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards on our reported financial statements and our non-GAAP managed basis financial results in MD&AImpact from Adoption of New Consolidation Accounting Standards.

21 Table of Contents Item 7.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2010 and related notes. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based upon managements current expectations and are subject to significant uncertainties and changes in circumstances.Please review Item 1. BusinessForward-Looking Statements for more information on the forward-looking statements in this report.Our actual results may differ materially from those included in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, those described in this report in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
INTRODUCTION We are a diversified financial services company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries that market a variety of financial products and services.We continue to deliver on our strategy of combining the power of national scale lending and local scale banking.
Our revenues are primarily driven by lending to consumers and commercial customers and by deposit-taking activities, which generate net interest income, and by activities that generate non-interest income, including the sale and servicing of loans and providing fee-based services to customers. Customer usage and payment patterns, credit quality, levels of marketing expense and operating efficiency all affect our profitability. Our expenses primarily consist of the cost of funding our assets, our provision for loan and lease losses, operating expenses (including associate salaries and benefits, infrastructure maintenance and enhancements, and branch operations and expansion costs), marketing expenses and income taxes. We had $125.9 billion in total loans outstanding and $122.2 billion in deposits as of December 31, 2010, compared with $136.8 billion in total managed loans outstanding and $115.8 billion in deposits as of December 31, 2009.
We evaluate our financial performance and report our results through three operating segments: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking.
Credit Card: Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending,national small business lending, national closed end installment lending and the international card lending businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom.
Consumer Banking: Consists of our branch-based lending and deposit gathering activities for consumer and small businesses, national deposit gathering, national automobile lending and consumer home loan lending and servicing activities.
Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending, deposit gathering and treasury management services to commercial real estate and middle market customers.
Table 1 summarizes our business segment results for 2010, 2009 and 2008.We report our business segment results based on income from continuing operations, net of tax.

IMPACT FROM ADOPTION OF NEW CONSOLIDATION ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Impact on Reported Financial Information Effective January 1, 2010, we prospectively adopted two new accounting standards that had a significant impact on our accounting for entities previously considered to be off-balance sheet arrangements. The adoption of these new accounting standards resulted in the consolidation of our credit card securitization trusts, one of our installment loan trusts and certain option-adjustable rate mortgages (option-ARM) loan trusts originated by Chevy Chase Bank. Prior to January 1, 2010, transfers of our credit card receivables, installment loans and certain option-adjustable rate mortgage loans to our securitization trusts were accounted for as sales and treated as off-balance sheet. At the adoption of these new accounting standards on January 1, 2010, we added to our reported consolidated balance sheet $41.9 billion of assets, consisting primarily of credit card loan receivables underlying the consolidated securitization trusts, along with $44.3 billion of related debt issued by these trusts to third-party investors. We also recorded an after-tax charge to retained earnings on January 1, 2010 of $2.9 billion, reflecting the net cumulative effect of adopting these new accounting standards. This charge primarily related to the addition of $4.3 billion to our allowance for loan and lease losses for the newly consolidated loans and the recording of $1.6 billion in related deferred tax assets. The initial recording of these amounts on our reported balance sheet as of January 1, 2010 had no impact on our reported income. We provide additional information on the impact on our financial statements from the adoption of these new accounting standards in Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations.We discuss the impact on our capital ratios below in Liquidity and Capital Management Capital.
Although the adoption of these new accounting standards does not change the economic risk to our business, specifically our exposure to liquidity, credit and interest rate risks, the prospective adoption of these rules has a significant impact on our capital ratios and the presentation of our reported consolidated financial statements, including changes in the classification of specific consolidated statements of income line items. The most significant changes to our reported consolidated financial statements are outlined below: Financial Statement Accounting and Presentation Changes Balance Sheet  Significant increase in restricted cash, securitized loans and securitized debt resulting from the consolidation of securitization trusts.
Significant increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses resulting from the establishment of a loan loss reserve for the loans underlying the consolidated securitization trusts.
Significant reduction in accounts receivable from securitizations resulting from the reversal of retained interests held in securitization trusts that have been consolidated.
Statement of Income  Significant increase in interest income and interest expense attributable to the securitized loans and debt underlying the consolidated securitization trusts.
Changes in the amount recorded for the provision for loan and lease losses, resulting from the establishment of an allowance for loan and lease losses for the loans underlying the consolidated securitization trusts.
Amounts previously recorded as servicing and securitization income are now classified in our results of operations in the same manner as the earnings on loans not held in securitization trusts.
Statement of Cash Flows  Significant change in the amounts of cash flows from investing and financing activities.
23 Table of Contents Beginning with the first quarter of 2010, our reported consolidated statements of income no longer reflect securitization and servicing income related to newly consolidated loans. Instead, we report interest income, net charge-offs and certain other income associated with securitized loan receivables and interest expense associated with the debt securities issued from the trust to third party investors in the same consolidated statements of income categories as loan receivables and corporate debt. Additionally, we no longer record initial gains on new securitization activity since the majority of our securitized loans will no longer receive sale accounting treatment. Because our securitization transactions are being accounted for under the new consolidation accounting rules as secured borrowings rather than asset sales, the cash flows from these transactions are presented as cash flows from financing activities rather than as cash flows from operating or investing activities. Notwithstanding this change in accounting, our securitization transactions are structured to legally isolate the receivables from our company, and we do not expect to be able to access the assets of our securitization trusts. We do, however, continue to have the rights associated with our retained interests in the assets of these trusts.
Because we prospectively adopted the new consolidation accounting standards, our historical reported results and consolidated financial statements for periods prior to January 1, 2010 reflect our securitization trusts as off-balance sheet in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance in effect during this period. Accordingly, our reported results and consolidated financial statements subsequent to January 1, 2010 are not presented on a basis consistent with our reported results and consolidated financial statements for periods prior to January 1, 2010. This inconsistency limits the comparability of our post-January 1, 2010 reported results to our prior period reported results.
Impact on Non-GAAP Managed Financial Information In addition to analyzing our results on a reported basis, management historically evaluated our total company and business segment results on a non-GAAP managed basis. Our managed presentations reflected the results from both our on-balance sheet loans and off-balance sheet loans and excluded the impact of card securitization activity. Our managed presentations assumed that our securitized loans had not been sold and that the earnings from securitized loans were classified in our results of operations in the same manner as the earnings on loans that we owned. Our managed results also reflected differences in accounting for the valuation of retained interests and the recognition of gains and losses on the sale of interest-only strips. Our managed results did not include the addition of an allowance for loan and lease losses for the loans underlying our off-balance sheet securitization trusts. While our managed presentation resulted in differences in the classification of revenues in our income statement, net income on a managed basis was the same as reported net income.
Prior to January 1, 2010, we used our non-GAAP managed basis presentation to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performance of our entire managed loan portfolio because the same underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both securitized loans and loans that we own. In addition, we used the managed presentation as the basis for making decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources, such as employees and capital. Because management used our managed basis presentation to evaluate our performance, we also provided this information to investors. We believed that our managed basis information was useful to investors because it portrayed the results of both on- and off-balance sheet loans that we managed, which enabled investors to understand the credit risks associated with the portfolio of loans reported on our consolidated balance sheet and our retained interests in securitized loans.
In periods prior to January 1, 2010, certain of our non-GAAP managed measures differed from the comparable reported measures. The adoption on January 1, 2010 of the new consolidation accounting standards resulted in accounting for the loans in our securitization trusts in our reported financial statements in a manner similar to how we account for these loans on a managed basis. As a result, our reported and managed basis presentations are generally comparable for periods beginning after January 1, 2010.
We believe that investors will be able to better understand our financial results and evaluate trends in our business if our period-over-period data are reflected on a more comparable basis. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted, this MD&A compares our reported U.S. GAAP financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 with our non-GAAP managed based financial information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. We provide a reconciliation of our non-GAAP managed based information for periods prior to January 1, 2010 to the most comparable reported U.S. GAAP information in Exhibit 99.1.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK We continued to operate in an environment of elevated economic and regulatory uncertainty during 2010.The overall economic recovery remained modest and fragile. The unemployment rate remained persistently high at close to 10% and the housing market continued to struggle, due in part to the large backlog of homes in the foreclosure process and high rate of delinquent loans. The ongoing and expected development of new regulations and regulatory organizations resulting from the recently enacted Dodd-FrankAct contributed to continued regulatory uncertainty.
24 Table of Contents Despite the challenges presented by these conditions, we began to see some stabilization in loan volumes, as well as improvements in our credit results that outpaced the economic recovery during 2010.Each of our businesses performed well during the year, generating net income of $2.7 billion ($6.01 per diluted share) in 2010, which represented a substantial increase of $1.9 billion over our reported net income of $884 million ($0.74 per diluted share) in 2009.We provide highlights of our 2010 financial performance below.
Financial Highlights As noted above, the presentation of our results on a non-GAAP managed basis prior to January 1, 2010 assumed that our securitized loans had not been sold and that the earnings from securitized loans were classified in our results of operations in the same manner as the earnings on loans that we owned. These classification differences resulted in differences in certain revenue and expense components of our results of operations on a reported basis and our results of operations on a managed basis, although net income for both basis was the same. We provide a summary of our managed results for 2009 and 2008 in "Note 20Business Segments." The $1.9 billion increase in our reported net income in 2010 was largely attributable to a substantial reduction in the provision for loan and lease losses, which was partially offset by an increase in losses from discontinued operations and a decrease in total revenue.
Decrease in Provision for Loan and Lease Losses: The provision for loan and lease losses decreased by $4.2 billion, or 52%, to $3.9 billion in 2010. The decrease in the provision was driven by the continued improvement of our credit quality indicators as a result of the slowly improving economy and actions taken by us over the past several years to improve underwriting standards and exit portfolios with unattractive credit metrics.As a result, we recorded a net release of $2.8 billion in 2010 in our allowance, after taking into consideration the addition to our allowance on January 1, 2010 from the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards compared with a net allowance release of $397 million in 2009.
Increase in Loss from Discontinued Operations: The loss from discontinued operations increased by $204 million to $307 million in 2010, primarily due to a significant increase in the provision for mortgage loan repurchase losses related to the discontinued operations of the wholesale mortgage banking unit of GreenPoint, which we closed in 2007. We recorded an after-tax provision for mortgage loan repurchase losses related to discontinued operations of $304 million ($432 million pre-tax) in 2010, compared with an after-tax provision related to discontinued operations of $120 million ($162 million pre-tax) in 2009.
Decrease in Total Revenue: Total revenue decreased by $659 million, or 4%, in 2010, largely due to a decline in non-interest fee income attributable to a reduction in customer accounts, and loan balancesand the implementation of provisions of the CARD Act, which resulted in a reduction in penalty fees.
Below are additional highlights of our performance for 2010. These highlights generally are based on a comparison of our reported results for 2010 to our managed results for 2009. The highlights of changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our reported financial condition and credit statistics as of December 31, 2010, compared with our financial condition and credit performance on a managed basis as of December 31, 2009. We provide a more detailed discussion of our results of operation, financial condition and credit performance in Consolidated Results of Operations Financial Performance, Consolidated Balance Sheet Analysis and Credit Performance and Business Segment Financial Performance.
Credit Card: Our Credit Card business generated income of $2.3 billion in 2010, compared with income of $978 million in 2009.The primary drivers of the improvement in our Credit Card business results were an increase in the net interest margin and a significant decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses. The increase in the net interest margin was attributable to the combined impact of higher asset yields and lower funding costs. The increase in the average yield on our credit card loan portfolio reflected the benefit of pricing changes that we implemented during 2009 and the continued benefit from rising collectability estimates due to favorable credit trends, while the decrease in our funding costs was attributable to the lower interest rate environment and shift in our funding mix to lower cost deposits from higher cost wholesale sources. The decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses was due to more favorable credit quality trends as well as a decline in outstanding loan balances.
25 Table of Contents  Consumer Banking: Our Consumer Banking business generated income of $905 million in 2010, compared with income of $244 million in 2009. The significant improvement in profitability in our Consumer Banking business was attributable to improved credit conditions and consumer credit performance, particularly within our auto loan portfolio, including reduced charge-offs. Our Consumer Banking business also benefited from deposit growth resulting from our continued strategy to leverage our bank outlets to attract lower cost funding sources and from improved deposit spreads, as we continue to shift the mix of our deposits to lower cost consumer savings and money market deposits from higher cost time deposits.
Commercial Banking: Our Commercial Banking business generated income of $160 million in 2010, compared with a loss of $213 million in 2009. The improvement in results for our Commercial Banking business in 2010 from 2009 was attributable to the stabilization in credit performance trends since the end of 2009, resulting in a significant reduction in the provision for loan and lease losses.Strong deposit growth resulting from our continued strategy togrow deposits as a lower cost funding source, as well as improved deposit spreads resulting from repricing of higher rate deposits to lower rates in response to the overall lower interest rate environment also provided a benefit to our Commercial Banking business. While our Commercial Banking credit metrics remain elevated, the commercial real estate market has exhibited signs of continuing improvement, including increasing leasing activity, declining vacancies and re-entry of traditional commercial real estate investors and sponsors into the market, particularly in New York where we have our most significant concentration.
Total Loans: Total loans held for investment decreased by $10.9 billion, or 8%, in 2010 to $125.9 billion as of December 31, 2010, from $136.8 billion as of December 31, 2009. This decrease was primarily due to the expected run-off of installment loans in our Credit Card business and home loans in our Consumer Banking business,elevatedcharge-offs and weak consumer demand.
Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics: Although net charge-off and delinquency rates remain elevated, these rates improved significantlyin 2010. The net charge-off rate decreased to 5.18% in 2010, from 5.87% in 2009, and the 30+ day performing delinquency rate decreased to 3.52% in 2010, from 4.62% in 2009.Based on strong credit performance trends, such as the significant decline in the 30+ day performing delinquency rate from 4.62% at the end of 2009, we believe our net-charge offs resulting from the severe economic downturn peaked in the first quarter of 2010.
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses: As a result of the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance, we increased our allowance for loan and lease losses by $4.3 billion to $8.4 billion on January 1, 2010. The initial recording of this amount on our reported balance sheet as of January 1, 2010 reduced our stockholders equity but had no impact on our reported results of operations. After taking into consideration the $4.3 billion addition to our allowance for loan and lease losses on January 1, 2010, our allowance for loan and lease losses decreased by $2.8 billion to $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2010.The decrease was attributable to an overall improvement in credit quality trends, as well as the decrease in loan balances. The allowance as a percentage of our total reported loans held for investment was 4.47% as of December 31, 2010, compared with 4.55% as of December 31, 2009.
Representation and Warranty Reserve: We have established reserves for our mortgage loan repurchase exposure related to the sale of mortgage loans by our subsidiaries to various parties under contractual provisions that include various representations and warranties. These reserves reflect inherent losses as of each balance sheet date that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable.We recorded a provision for this exposure of $636 million in 2010, of which $204 million was included in non-interest income and $432 million was included in discontinued operations.In comparison, we recorded a provision of $181 million in 2009, of which $19 million was included in non-interest income and $162 million was included in discontinued operations. Because of the significant increase in claim requests fromgovernmentsponsored entities ("GSEs") and Active Insured Securitizations and litigation activity during 2010, we refined our loss estimation process and made certain changes in assumptions. During second quarter of 2010, we extended the timeframe over which we estimated our repurchase liability for mortgage loans sold by our subsidiaries to GSEs and those mortgage loans placed into Active Insured Securitizations for the full life of the mortgage loans, which resulted in a significant increase inthe provision for mortgage loan repurchase losses. Of the $636 million of provision recorded in 2010, approximately $407 million resulted from our ability to extend the timeframe over which we estimated our repurchase liability.The remaining $229 million related primarily to changing counterparty activity in the form of updated estimates around active and probable litigation, most of which occurred in the first quarter of 2010.Our representation and warranty reserves totaled $816 million as of December 31, 2010, compared with $238 million as of December 31, 2009.
Capital Adequacy: While the consolidation of the loans underlying our securitization trusts on January 1, 2010 reduced our capital ratios, our financial strength and capacity to absorb risk remained high.Our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.63% as of December 31, 2010 was comfortably above the current minimum regulatoryrequirement of 4.0%.Our non-GAAP Tier 1 common equity ratio was 8.78% as of December 31, 2010, while our non-GAAP tangible common equity to tangible managed assets (TCE ratio) was 6.86%.See Exhibit 99.1 for a calculation of our regulatory capital ratios and a reconciliation of our non-GAAP capital measures.
26 Table of Contents Business Environment and Significant Recent Developments The lingering economic and regulatory impacts of 2010 will likely impact the full year income statement in 2011. We expect that 2011 revenue will reflect the full year effects of revenue impacts that began in 2010, including changes to revenue in our Credit Card business as a result of the CARD Act implementation and the reductions in fee revenues brought on by new regulations.We expect the slow-paced economic recovery will continue, with the overall unemployment rate expected to remain elevated for an extended period of time.
We also continue to see risks in the housing market, due in part to the large backlog of homes in the foreclosure process and high rate of delinquent loans, which could be exacerbated if recent disruptions in industry foreclosure practices continue.
We anticipate over the course of coming quarters to see evidence of the path to solid and sustained performance.We believe that substantially all of the impacts on revenue related to CARD Act regulations were reflected in our fourth quarter revenue margins. We expect relatively less impact from other aspects of the recently enacted financial legislation.
We provide more information on recent regulatory developments in Supervision and Regulation in Item 1. Business of this report.
Business Outlook We discuss below our current expectations regarding our total company performance and the performance of each of our business segments over the near-term based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and our business strategies as of the time we filed this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The statements contained in this section are based on our current expectations regarding our outlook for our financial results and business strategies.Our expectations take into account, and should be read in conjunction with, our expectations regarding economic trends and analysis of our business as discussed in Item 1. Business and MD&A of this report.Certain statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.Actual results could differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements.Forward-looking statements do not reflect (i) any change in current dividend or repurchase strategies, (ii) the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions or (iii) any changes in laws, regulations or regulatory interpretations, in each case after the date as of which such statements are made.See Forward-Looking Statements in Item 1. Business of this report for factors that could materially influence our results.
Total Company Expectations We believe weare emerging from the recession in a strong position to deliver attractive and sustainable results over the long-term, including moderate growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns on assets in our Credit Card and Auto Finance businesses, moderate growth in low-risk loans in our Commercial Banking business and strong growth in low-cost deposits and high-quality commercial and retail customer relationships.Based on recent trends and our targeted initiatives to attract new business and develop customer relationships, we believe there is reasonable potential for loan growth during 2011, which will depend on consumer demand.
Total Loans: Loan balances stabilized in the second half of 2010, reflecting the decline in charge-offs, gradual abatement of expected portfolio run-offs and seasonal consumer spending trends.The lower starting point for loan balances from 2010 will cause the average loan balances in 2011 to be comparable to 2010, even as we expect period-end balances to grow.The timing and pace of expected growth will depend on broader economic trends that impact overall consumer and commercial demand.
Expenses: We anticipate that non-interest expenses will increase in 2011, assuming that the increase in marketing opportunities we observed in late 2010 continues through 2011.
Provision for Loan and Lease Losses: B ased on the underlying credit trends we are experiencing, we expect that charge-offs will continue their downward trend, although the pace of the allowance releases of 2010 is likely to abate during 2011.We expect that the improvement in credit trends in our Consumer Lending businesses will continue to outpace the economic recovery. We believe that the worst of the Commercial Banking business credit downturn is behind us; however, we expect a few more quarters of fluctuations in the charge-off and nonperforming loan metrics in our Commercial Banking business.
Margins: Margins will be affected as the onboarding of lower yield and lower loss assets are offset by a lower year-over-year average cost of funds and higher transaction volume. We expect margins to remain at strong levels, although they may drift downward modestly, depending upon the competitive environment and the timing and pace of loan growth. We expect continued funding mix shift towards deposits in 2011, which should provide modest funding cost benefits to net interest margin.
Capital: We expect r egulatory capital ratios to rise steadily after a temporary decline in the first quarter of 2011.
Although capital measures such as our non-GAAP TCE are expected to rise steadily, we expect our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and our non-GAAP Tier 1 common equity ratio to decline into the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to two factors that affect the numerator and denominator used in calculating these ratios: (i) a decrease in the numerator resulting from the disallowance of a portion of the deferred tax assets and (ii) an increase in the denominator due to the remaining phase-in during the first quarter of 2011 of risk-weighted assets resulting from the new consolidation accounting standards .Even with the expected increase in our loan balances, the completion of this consolidation will most likely lead to slower growth in the denominator of our regulatory capital ratios over the next couple of years as compared to the recent past.We expect the numerator of these ratios will rise not only a s we generate earnings but also with the steady decline in our disallowed deferred tax asset amount , which we expect will be around $2.0 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2011 and will largely disappear over the next couple of years.
27 Table of Contents Based on the current definitions proposed by the Basel Committee, we expect to exceed in 2011 the Basel III minimum common equity ratio, including the capital conservation buffer.
We expect that our strong capital position and generation will enable us to deploy capital in the service of shareholders to generate attractive returns in 2011 and beyond.
Business Segment Expectations Credit Card Business We expect that normal seasonal patterns will drive a decline in Domestic Card loan balances in the first quarter of 2011, and that the first quarter of 2011 will be the low-point for Domestic Card loan balances.After the first quarter of 2011, we expect loan balances in our Credit Card business to grow.By the end of the second quarter of 2011, we expect Domestic Card loan balances to be higher than balances at the end of 2010.We expect further growth in the second half of 2011.We anticipate modest improvements from current charge-off levels in 2011.We expect to add partnership loan portfolios and growth platforms, including launching the recently announcedpartnership with Kohl's Department Stores, Inc., whichwe expect to settle in the second quarter of 2011.
Consumer Banking Business In our Consumer Banking business, we expect that Auto Finance origination volumes and returns will remain strong in 2011. We expect our Retail Banking business will continue to deliver strong growth in low-cost deposits and valuable customer relationships.
Commercial Banking Business In our Commercial Banking business, nonperforming asset rates and criticized loans continue to improve modestly, and, as such, we believe that the worst of the Commercial Banking business credit deterioration cycle is behind us.
We believe, however, that the charge-off rate for our Commercial Banking business will continue to fluctuate over the next several quarters.
We expect to grow our Commercial Banking loan portfolio in 2011. Based on strong deposit growth and new commercial customer relationships in 2010, we expect to generate future loan and revenue growth by expanding the relationships with our customers in 2011 and beyond.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses in the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies in Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
We have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition.These critical accounting policies govern:  Fair value  Allowance for loan and lease losses  Asset impairment 28 Table of Contents  Representation and warranty reserve  Revenue recognition  Derivative and hedge accounting  Income taxes We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions. Management has reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies and has discussed these policies with the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.
Fair Value Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date (also referred to as an exit price).The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable.Fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned to a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant tothe fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Observable market-based inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs.
The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted prices in active markets or observable market parameters. When quoted prices and observable data in active markets are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value.Changes in market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value.
We have developed policies and procedures to determine when markets for our financial assets and liabilities are inactive if the level and volume of activity has declined significantly relative to normal conditions. If markets are determined to be inactive, it may be appropriate to adjust price quotes received.When significant adjustments are required to price quotes or inputs, it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs.
Significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain financial instruments measured at fair value are included in Level 2 or Level 3.In making this determination, we consider all available information that market participants use to measure the fair value of the financial instrument, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. Based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the Level 3 inputs to the instruments fair value measurement in its entirety.If Level 3 inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. The process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions.
Our financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis represented approximately 22% of our total reported assets of $197.5 billion as of December 31, 2010, compared with 26% of our total reported assets of $169.6 billion as of December 31, 2009.Financial assets for which the fair value was determined using significant Level 3 inputs represented approximately 2% of these financial instruments (1% of total assets) as of December 31, 2010, and approximately 14% of these financial instruments(4% of total assets) as of December 31, 2009.The decreases in the percentage of financial instruments measured at a fair value on a recurring basis and in the percentage of financial instruments measured using Level 3 inputs were primarily attributable to the increase in our assets from the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards, as the consolidated loans are generally classified as held for investment and are therefore not measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
We discuss changes in the valuation inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our financial instruments, including the extent to which we have relied on significant unobservable inputs to estimate fair value and our process for corroborating these inputs, in Note 19Fair Value of Financial Instruments.
29 Table of Contents Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Our allowance for loan and lease losses provides for probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of each balance sheet date.We have an established process, using analytical tools, benchmarks and management judgment, to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses. We calculate the allowance for loan and lease losses by estimating probable losses separately for segments of our loan portfolio with similar risk characteristics.
We generally review and assess our allowance methodologies and adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses on a quarterly basis. Our assessment involves evaluating many factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, recent trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, risk ratings, the impact of bankruptcy filings, deceased and recovered amounts, the value of collateral underlying secured loans, account seasoning, changes in our credit evaluation, underwriting and collection management policies, seasonality, general economic conditions, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance for loan and lease losses. Key factors that have a significant impact on our allowance for loan and lease losses include assumptions about unemployment rates, home prices, and the valuation of commercial properties, consumer real estate, and automobiles.
Although we examine a variety of externally available data, as well as our internal loan performance data, to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses, our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties, including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance. Accordingly, our actual credit loss experience may not be in line with our expectations.For example, as a result of improving credit performance trends during 2010, charge-offs began to decrease and we recorded a significant allowance release of $2.8 billion.We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses for each of our loan portfolio segments in Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.We provide information on the components of our allowance, disaggregated by impairment methodology, and changes in our allowance in Note 6Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.
Asset Impairment We review other assets for impairment on a regular basis.This process requires significant management judgment and involves various estimates and assumptions.Our investment securities and goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our other assets.Accordingly, below we describe our process for assessing impairment of these assets and the key estimates and assumptions involved in this process.
Investment Securities We regularly review investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria. Effective April 1, 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended and modified the requirements for recognizing and measuring other-than-temporary impairment for debt securities.
If we intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell a security before its anticipated recovery, the entire difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value is recognized in earnings . If we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost, we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists.Our evaluation requires significant management judgment and a consideration of many factors, including, but not limited to, the extent and duration of the impairment; the health of and specific prospects for the issuer, including whether the issuer has failed to make scheduled interest or principal payments; recent events specific to the issuer and/or industry to which the issuer belongs; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings; the value of underlying collateral and current market conditions. Quantitative criteria include assessing whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows. For equity securities, our evaluation criteria include the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position.See Note 4Investment Securities for additional information.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets As a result of our acquisitions, principally Hibernia Corporation in 2005, North Fork Bancorporation in 2006, and Chevy Chase Bank in 2009, we have goodwill and other intangible assets.Goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to January 1, 2009 represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill resulting from business combinations after January 1, 2009, is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. We had goodwill of $13.6 billion recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of both December 31, 2010 and 2009.Other intangible assets consist primarily of core deposit intangibles.Other intangible assets, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets, totaled $733 million and $906 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Goodwill and other intangible assets together represented 7% of our total assets as of December 31, 2010, compared with 9% of total assets as of December 31, 2009.
30 Table of Contents Goodwill is not amortized but must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment on an annual basis or in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment.A reporting unit is a business segment or one level below.Our reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing are Domestic Card, International Card, Auto Finance,other Consumer Bankingand Commercial Banking.We perform our annual goodwill impairment test for all reporting units as of October 1 each year using a two-step process.First, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its current carrying amount, including goodwill.
If the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, the related goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no further analysis is necessary.If, however, the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and a second step of testing is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any, for that reporting unit.
Estimating the fair value of reporting units and the assets, liabilities and intangible assets of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium.Management judgment is required to assess whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by the fair value of the individual reporting unit.There are widely accepted valuation methodologies, such as the market approach (earnings multiples and/or transaction multiples) and/or discounted cash flow methods, that are used to estimate the fair value of reporting units.In applying these methodologies, we utilize a number of factors, including actual operating results, future business plans, economic projections, and market data.We also may engage an independent valuation specialist to assist in our valuation process.
In estimating the fair value of the reporting units in step one of the goodwill impairment analysis, fair values can be sensitive to changes in the projected cash flows and assumptions. In some instances, minor changes in the assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount. Furthermore, a prolonged decrease or increase in a particular assumption could eventually lead to the fair value of a reporting unit being less than its carrying amount. Also, to the extent step two of the goodwill analysis is required, changes in the estimated fair values of individual assets and liabilities may impact other estimates of fair value for assets or liabilities and result in a different amount of implied goodwill, and ultimately the amount of goodwill impairment, if any.
In conducting our goodwill impairment test for 2010, we determined the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis, a form of the income approach. Our discounted cash flow analysis required management to make judgments about future loan and deposit growth, revenue growth, credit losses, and capital rates.We relied on each reporting units internal cash flow forecast and calculated a terminal value using a growth rate that reflected the nominal growth rate of the economy as a whole and appropriate discount rates for the respective reporting units. We adjusted cash flows as necessary to maintain each reporting units equity capital requirements. The cash flows were discounted to present value using reporting unit specific discount rates that were largely based on our external cost of equity, adjusted for risks inherent in each reporting unit.We corroborated the key inputs used in our discounted cash flow analysis with market data, where available, to validate that our assumptions were within a reasonable range of observable market data.
Based on the results of step one of our 2010 goodwill impairment test, we determined that the carrying amount of each of our reporting units, including goodwill, exceeded the fair value.Accordingly, the goodwill of our reporting units was considered not impaired, and the second step of impairment testing was not required.However, assuming all other factors were held constant, a 34% decline in the fair value of the Domestic Card reporting unit, a 14% decline in the fair value of the International Card reporting unit, a 37% decline in the fair value of the Auto Finance reporting unit, a 30% decline in the fair value of the Commercial Banking reporting unit and a 21% decline in the fair value of the other Consumer Banking reporting unit would have caused the carrying amount for those reporting units to be in excess of fair value which would require the second step to be performed.
As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, we assessed our market capitalization based on the average market price relative to the aggregate fair value of our reporting units and determined that any excess fair value in ourreporting units at that time could be attributed to a reasonable control premium compared to historical control premiums seen in the industry.During 2009, the lack of liquidity in the financial markets and the continued economic deterioration led to a decline in market capitalization resulting in significantly higher control premiums than what had been seen historically.Throughout 2010, our capitalization rate increased resulting in a decline in our implied control premium.We will continue to regularly monitor our market capitalization in 2011, overall economic conditions and other events or circumstances that may result in an impairment of goodwill in the future.
31 Table of Contents Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated lives and evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an assets or asset groups carrying value may not be fully recoverable.An impairment loss, generally calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group, is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value. We did not recognize impairment on our other intangible assets in 2010, 2009 or 2008.
We provide additional information on the nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets, including the process and methodology used to conduct goodwill impairment testing, in Note 8Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Representation and Warranty Reserve In connection with their sales of mortgage loans, certain subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the loans compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser, including underwriting guidelines and the ongoing existence of mortgage insurance, and the loans compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. We may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan, indemnify the investor or insurer, or reimburse the investor for credit losses incurred on the loan in the event of a material breach of contractual representations or warranties.
We have established representation and warranty reserves for losses that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary, including both litigation and non-litigation liabilities.The reserve-setting process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires the application of judgment.In establishing the representation and warranty reserves, we consider a variety of factors, depending on the category of purchaser and rely on historical data.We evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis.
During the first and second quarters of 2010, we made significant refinements to our process for estimating our representation and warranty reserve, due primarily to increased counterparty activity and our ability to extend the timeframe over which we estimate our repurchase liability for mortgage loans sold by our subsidiaries to GSEs and those mortgage loans placed into Active Insured Securitizations for the full life of the mortgage loans.Priorto the second quarter of 2010, we generally estimated the amount of probable repurchase requests to be received over the next 12 months.As a result of these refinements, we recorded a substantial increase in our representation and warranty repurchase reserve in the first and second quarters of 2010.Approximately $407 million of the $636 million of provision for representation and warranty reserves recorded in 2010 resultedfrom our extension of repurchase liability estimates to the life of the loan effective in the second quarter of 2010. The remaining $229 million related primarily to changing counterparty activity in the form of updated estimates around active and probable litigation, most of which occurred in the first quarter of 2010.
Our aggregate representation and warranty mortgage repurchase reserves, which we report as a component of other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $816 million as of December 31, 2010, compared with $238 million as of December 31, 2009.The adequacy of the reserves and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by us or one of our subsidiaries will depend on, among other things, actual future mortgage loan performance, the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests, the actual success rates of claimants, developments in litigation, actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices).See Consolidated Balance Sheet Analysis and Credit PerformancePotential Mortgage Representation & Warranty Liabilities below and Note 21Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees for additional information.
Revenue Recognition We recognize earned finance charges, interest income and fees on loans in interest income in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements.Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, if applicable. Interest and fees accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status are reversed against earnings.Finance charges and fees on credit card loans are included in loan receivables when billed to the customer. We continue to accrue finance charges and fees on credit card loans until the account is charged-off.However, when we do not expect full payment of billed finance charges and fees, we reduce the balance of our credit card loan receivables by the amount of finance charges billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from interest income.Revenue was reduced by $950 million, $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, for the estimated uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees.
Our methodology for estimating the uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for incurred principal losses on our credit card loan receivables.Accordingly, the estimation process is subject to similar risks and uncertainties, including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance. Changes in key assumptions may have a material impact on the amount of billed finance charges and fees we estimate as uncollectible in each period.
32 Table of Contents Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, and to a lesser extent, foreign currency risk.Our derivatives are designated as either qualifying accounting hedges or free-standing derivatives.Free-standing derivatives consist of customer-accommodation derivatives and economic hedges that we enter into for risk management purposes that are not linked to specific assets or liabilities or to forecasted transactions and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting.Qualifying accounting hedges are designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.Although all derivative financial instruments, whether designated for hedge accounting or not, are reported at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheets, the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments differs based on whether the derivative has been designated as a qualifying accounting hedge and the type of accounting hedge.
To obtain and maintain hedge accounting, we must be able to establish at inception that the hedging instrument is effective at offsetting the risk of the hedged item both retrospectively and prospectively, and ensure documentation meets stringent requirements. The process to test effectiveness requires applying judgment and estimation, including the number of data points to test to ensure adequate and appropriate measurement to confirm or dispel hedge effectiveness and valuation of data within effectiveness tests where external existing data available do not perfectly match the companys circumstances. Without hedge accounting, we may experience significant volatility in our earnings as we would be required to recognize all changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments in earnings.
We provide detail on derivatives gains and losses recognized in our earnings in 2010, 2009 and 2008 and amounts related to cash flow hedges recorded in AOCIas of December 31, 2010 in Note 11Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
Income Taxes Our annual income tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.
Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short and long-range business forecasts to provide insight.
Amounts recorded for deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, were $4.0 billion and $3.7 billion as of December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.We had recorded a valuation allowance of $130 million and $109 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.We currently expect to fully recover the net deferred tax asset amounts at the end of 2010 within the applicable statutory expiration periods. To the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.
If changes in circumstances lead us to change our judgment about our ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years, we would adjust our valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs and record a corresponding increase or charge to income.
We provide additional information on income taxes in Consolidated Results of Operations Financial Performance and in Note 18Income Taxes.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS New accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting pronouncements may have a significant effect on our results of operations, financial condition, stockholders equity, capital ratios or business operations. As discussed above, effective January 1, 2010, we adopted two new accounting standards that had a significant impact on the manner in which we account for our securitization transactions, our consolidated financial statements and our capital ratios. These new accounting standards eliminated the concept of qualified special purpose entities (QSPEs), revised the accounting for transfers of financial assets and changed the consolidation criteria for variable interest entities (VIEs). Under the new accounting guidance, the determination to consolidate a VIE is based on a qualitative assessment of which party to the VIE has power combined with potentially significant benefits or losses, instead of the previous quantitative risks and rewards model. Consolidation is required when an entity has the power to direct matters which significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE, together with either the obligation to absorb losses or the rights to receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE. The prospective adoption of this new accounting guidance resulted in our consolidating substantially all our existing securitization trusts that had previously been off-balance sheet and eliminated sales treatment for new transfers of loans to securitization trusts.
33 Table of Contents We provide additional information on the impact of these new accounting standards above in Impact from Adoption of New Consolidation Accounting Standards and in Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We also identify and discuss the impact of other significant recently issued accounting pronouncements, including those not yet adopted, in Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
OFF -BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various types of transactions with limited liability companies, partnerships or trusts that often involve special purpose entities (SPEs) and VIEs. Some of these arrangements are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or may be recorded in amounts different from the full contract or notional amount of the transaction, depending on the nature or structure of, and accounting required to be applied to, the arrangement.These arrangements may expose us to potential losses in excess of the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. Our involvement in these arrangements can take many forms, including securitization and servicing activities, the purchase or sale of mortgage-backed or other asset-backed securities in connection with our home loan portfolio, and loans to VIEs that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets. Under previous accounting guidance, we were not required to consolidate the majority of our securitization trusts because they were QSPEs. Accordingly, we considered these trusts to be off-balance sheet arrangements.
In June 2009, the FASB issued two new accounting standards that eliminated the concept of QSPEs, revised the accounting for transfers of financial assets and changed the consolidation criteria for VIEs. As discussed above in Impact from Adoption of New Consolidation Accounting Standards,we prospectively adopted these new standards on January 1, 2010,which resulted in the consolidation of our credit card securitization trusts, one installment loan trust, certain option-ARM loan trusts originated by Chevy Chase Bank for which we provide servicing and certain affordable housing entities. Allofour remaining securitization trusts were consolidated or liquidated as of December 31, 2010.
Our continuing involvement in unconsolidated VIEs primarily consists of certain mortgage loan trusts and community reinvestment and development entities. The carrying amount of assets and liabilities of these unconsolidated VIEs was $2.0 billion and $344 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2010, and our maximum exposure to loss was $2.2 billion. We provide a discussion of our activities related to these VIEs in Note 7Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations.
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE As indicated above under Impact from Adoption of New Consolidation Accounting Standards, our reported results subsequent to January 1, 2010 are not presented on a basis consistent with our reported results prior to January 1, 2010 as a result of our adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards.Our reported results subsequent to January 1, 2010 are more comparable to our managed results because we assumed for our managed based reporting that our securitized loans had not been sold and that the earnings from securitized loans were classified in our results of operations in the same manner as the earnings on loans that we owned.Accordingly, the section below provides a comparative discussion of our reported consolidated results of operations for 2010 and our managed results for 2009 and 2008. Our net income on a managed basis in 2009 and 2008 is the same as our reported net income; however, there are differences in the classification of certain amounts in our managed income statement, which we identify in our discussion.See Exhibit 99.1 for a reconciliation of our non-GAAP managed based information for periods prior to January 1, 2010 to the most comparable reported U.S. GAAP information.
Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between the interest income and applicable fees earned on our interest-earning assets, which includes loans held for investment and investment securities, and the interest expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, which includes interest-bearing deposits, senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt and other borrowings. We include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem are collectible. Our net interest margin represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest bearing liabilities, including the impact of non-interest bearing funding. Prior to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards on January 1, 2010, our reported net interest income did not include interest income from loans in our off-balance sheet securitization trusts or the interest expense on third-party debt issued by these securitization trusts. Beginning January 1, 2010, servicing fees, finance charges, other fees, net charge-offs and interest paid to third party investors related to consolidated securitization trusts are included in net interest income.
34 Table of Contents Table 2 below displays the major sources of our interest income and interest expense for 2010, 2009 and 2008.We present for each major category of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average outstanding balances, the interest earned or paid and the average yield or cost during the period in Table A under Supplemental Statistical Tables.We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

(2) We calculate the change in interest income and interest expense separately for each item. The change in net interest income attributable to both volume and rates is allocated based on the relative dollar amount of each item.
36 Table of Contents Our reported net interest income of $12.5 billion in 2010 increased by 3% from managed net interest income of $12.1 billion in 2009, driven by a 9% (59 basis points) expansion of our net interest margin to 7.09%, which was partially offset by a 5% decrease in average interest-earning assets.
The increase in net interest margin in 2010 was primarily attributable to a significant reduction in our average cost of funds, coupled with an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. Our cost of funds continued to benefit from the shift in the mix of our funding to lower cost consumer and commercial banking deposits from higher cost wholesale sources. Also, the overall interest rate environment, combined with our disciplined pricing, drove a decrease in our average deposit interest rates. The increase in the average yield on our interest-earning assets during 2010 reflected the benefit of pricing changes that we implemented during 2009, which contributed to an increase in the average yield on our loan portfolio, as well as improved credit conditions, which has allowed us to recognize a greater proportion of previously reserved uncollected finance charges into income.The decrease in average interest-earning assets resulted from the run-off of loans in business that we exited or repositioned, elevated charge-offs and weak consumer demand.
Our managed net interest income of $12.1 billion in 2009 increased by 6% from managed net interest income of $11.4 billion in 2008, driven by a 2% (13 basis points) expansion of our net interest margin to 6.50% and a 4% increase in our average interest-earning assets.The increase was largely due to a reduction in our average cost of funds, attributable to the low interest rate environment and shift in our funding mix to lower cost deposits.
Non-Interest Income Non-interest income consists of servicing and securitizations income, service charges and other customer-related fees, interchange income and other non-interest income. We also record the mortgage loan repurchase provision related to continuing operations in non-interest income.Prior to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards on January 1, 2010, our reported non-interest income included servicing fees, finance charges, other fees, net charge-offs and interest paid to third party investors related to our securitization trusts as a component of non-interest income. In addition, when we created securitization trusts, we recognized gains or losses on the transfer of loans to these trusts and recorded our initial retained interests in the trusts. EffectiveJanuary 1, 2010, unless we qualify for sale accounting under the new consolidation accounting standards, weno longer recognize a gain or loss or record retained interests when we transfer loans into securitization trusts. The servicing fees, finance charges, other fees, net of charge-offs and interest paid to third party investors related to our consolidated securitization trusts are now reported as a component of net interest income instead of as a component of non-interest income.
Table 5 displays the components of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
Table 5: Non-Interest Income Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 (1) 2008 (Dollars in millions) Reported Reported Managed Reported Managed Non-interest income: Servicing and securitizations $ 7 $ 2,280 $ (193 ) $ 3,385 $ (299 ) Service charges and other customer-related fees 2,073 1,997 3,025 2,232 3,687 Interchange 1,340 502 1,408 562 1,464 Net other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) (65 ) (32 ) (32 ) (11 ) (11 ) Other 359 539 539 576 576 Total non-interest income $ 3,714 $ 5,286 $ 4,747 $ 6,744 $ 5,417 ______________ (1) Effective February 27, 2009, we acquired Chevy Chase Bank. Accordingly, our results for 2009 include only a partial impact from Chevy Chase Bank .
Non-interest income of $3.7 billion in 2010 decreased by $1.0 billion, or 22%, from managed non-interest income of $4.7 billion in 2009.Managed non-interest income of $4.7 billion in 2009 decreased by $670 million, or 12%, from managed non-interest income of $5.4 billion in 2008.
The $1.0 billion decrease in non-interest income in 2010 from 2009 was primarily attributable to a reduction in over-limit fees as result of provisions under the CARD Act, a decline in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights due to the run-off of our home loan portfolio, and an increase in the provision for mortgage loan repurchases.We recorded a provision for mortgage loan repurchase losses of $636 million in 2010, $204 million of which was included in non-interest income, and a provision of $181 million in 2009, of which $19 million was included in non-interest income.We provide additional information on representation and warranty claims in Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates and in Consolidated Balance Sheet Analysis and Credit PerformancePotential Mortgage Representation and Warranty Liabilities.
37 Table of Contents The net other-than-temporary impairment losses of $65 million and $32 million recorded in 2010 and 2009, respectively, primarily resulted from the deterioration in the credit quality of certain non-agency mortgage-related securities due to the continued weakness in the housing market and high unemployment.We also recorded other-than-temporary impairment on certain other non-agency mortgage-related securities in 2010 because of our intent to sell the securities. We provide additional information on other-than-temporary impairment recognized on our available-for-sale securities in Note 4Investment Securities.
The $670 million decrease in managed non-interest income in 2009 from 2008 was largely due to reduced service charges and customer-related fees as a result of lower overlimit and cash advance fees.
Provision for Loan and Lease Losses We build our allowance for loan and lease losses through the provision for loan and lease losses. Our provision for loan and lease losses in each period is driven by charge-offs and the level of allowance for loan and lease losses that we determine is necessary to provide for probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of each balance sheet date.
We recorded a reportedprovision for loan and lease losses of $3.9 billion in 2010, compared with a reported provision for loan and lease losses of $4.2 billion in 2009 and $5.1 billion in 2008.Our managed provision for loan and lease losses totaled $8.1 billon and $8.0 billon in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The significant decrease in the managedprovision expense for loan and lease losses in 2010 was attributable toreduced charge-offsand continued improvement in credit performance, as well as a reduction in our loan portfolio balance. As a result, we recorded a significant reduction in our allowance for loan and lease losses during 2010.The decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses in 2009 from 2008 was largely due to a significant decline in our loan portfolio balance.
Table 22 below, under Consolidated Balance Sheet AnalysisSummary of Reported Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses summarizes changes in our allowance for loan and lease losses and details the provision for loan and lease losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income and the charge-offs recorded against our allowance for loan and lease losses in 2010, 2009 and 2008.
Non-Interest Expense Non-interest expense consists of ongoing operating costs, such as salaries and associated employee benefits, communications and other technology expenses, supplies and equipment and occupancy costs, and miscellaneous expenses. Marketing expenses are also included in non-interest expense. Table 6 displays the components of non-interest expense for 2010, 2009 and 2008.

(2) Consists of professional services expenses, credit collection costs, fee assessments and intangible amortization expense.Other non-interest expense for 2008 includes goodwill impairment of $811 million related to the Auto Finance division of our Consumer Banking business.
38 Table of Contents Non-interest expense of $7.9 billion in 2010 was up $517 million, or 7%, from 2009. The increase was primarily due increases in marketing expenditures and salaries and associate benefits, partially offset by the absence of restructuring charges.As the economy gradually improved, we substantially increased our marketing expenditures during 2010, from suppressed levels in 2009, to attract and support new business volume through a variety of channels.In 2009, we completed the restructuring of our operations that was initiated in 2007 to improve our competitive cost position as well as reduce certain expenses.
Non-interest expense of $7.4 billion in 2009 was down $793 million, or 10%, from 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the absence of a goodwill impairment charge of $811 million recorded in 2008, as well as a reduction in marketing expenditures during 2009 in response to the severe economic downturn.The goodwill impairment charge in 2008 was attributable to the Auto Finance division of our Consumer Banking business and reflected a reduction in the estimated fair value of this business due to our strategic decision to scale back origination volume.
Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate based on income from continuing operations was 29.56%, 26.16% and 85.47% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively . The variance in our effective tax rate between periods is due, in part, to fluctuations in our pre-tax earnings, which affects the relative tax benefit of tax-exempt income, tax credits and permanent tax items.
The increase in our effective tax rate in 2010 from 2009 reflected the reduced relative benefit of tax-exempt income and tax credits as a result of the increase in our pre-tax earnings.We recorded a $90 million tax benefit primarily related to the settlement of certain pre-acquisition tax liabilities related to North Fork and the resolution of certain tax issues before the U.S. Tax Court in 2010, which partially offset the increase in our effective tax rate for this period.
The significant decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2009 from 2008 was primarily attributable to the goodwill impairment charge of $811 million recorded in 2008, a portion of which was non-deductible.Our effective tax rate in 2008 excluding the impact of non-deductible goodwill impairment was 37.8%.In addition, increased tax credits, reductions in unrecognized tax benefits due to tax settlements and resolutions and changes in our international tax position had a favorable impact on our 2009 effective tax rate.
Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax Loss from discontinued operations reflects ongoing costs, which primarily consist of mortgage loan repurchase representation and warranty charges, related to the mortgage origination operations of GreenPoints wholesale mortgage banking unit, which we closed in 2007.We recorded a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $307 million, $103 million and $131 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
The significant increase in loss from discontinued operations in 2010 was attributable to the increase in our mortgage loan repurchase representation and warranty reserves.We recorded a pre-tax provision for mortgage loan repurchase exposure of $636 million in 2010, of which $432 million ($304 million net of tax) was included in discontinued operations.In comparison, we recorded a pre-tax provision for mortgage loan repurchase exposure of $181 million in 2009, of which $162 million ($120 million net of tax) was included in discontinued operations.
We provide additional information on representation and warranty claims in Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates and in Consolidated Balance Sheet Analysis and Credit PerformancePotential Mortgage Representation and Warranty Liabilities.
BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Our principal operations are currently organized into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served:Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking.The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments.
The results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources.Our business segment results are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. We use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results.Our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain managed balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment.
39 Table of Contents We refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our managed presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on U.S. GAAP.There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore, the managed basis presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial service companies.In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.We provide additional information on our business segments, including the basis of presentation, business segment reporting methodologies, and a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in Note 20Business Segments.
We summarize our business segment results for 2010, 2009 and 2008 in the tables below and provide a comparative discussion of these results. We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. In 2009, we realigned our organizational structure and business segment reporting to reflect our operating results by product type and customer segment and to integrate the operations of Chevy Chase Bank.Prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the current period presentation.We provide information on the outlook for each of our business segments above under Executive Summary and Business Outlook.
Credit Card Business Our Credit Card business generated income of $2.3 billion in 2010, compared with income of $978 million in 2009 and $1.1 billion in 2008.The primary sources of revenue for our Credit Card business are net interest income and non-interest income from customer and interchange fees.Expenses primarily consist of ongoing operating costs, such as salaries and associated benefits, communications and other technology expenses, supplies and equipment and occupancy costs, as well as marketing expenses.
Table 7 summarizes the financial results of our Credit Card business, which is comprised of Domestic Card, installment loans and International Card operations, and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.In conjunction with our Sony Card partnership, we acquired the $807 million legacy Sony Card portfolio on September 1, 2010.The Sony Card acquisition did not have a material impact on the results of our Credit Card business in 2010.

(4) As a result of the January 1, 2010 adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards, we added $4.2 billion to the allowance related to our Credit Card business on January 1, 2010, resulting in an allowance of $6.4 billion as of January 1, 2010.The allowance decreased during the remainder of 2010 by $2.3 billion, or 37%.
Key factors affecting the results of our Credit Card business for 2010, compared with 2009 included the following:  Net Interest Income: Our Credit Card business experienced an increase in net interest income of $352 million, or 5%, in 2010, which was primarily attributable to higher asset yields that more than offset a decline in average loans held for investment.The increase in the average yield on our credit card loan portfolio reflected the benefit of pricing changes that were implemented during 2009 and a reduction in the level of loans with low introductory promotional rates.Net interest income also reflected the benefit of the recognition into income of an increased amount of previously suppressed billed finance charges and fees as a result of improving credit trends.
Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income decreased by $1.0 billion, or 27%, in 2010.The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in penalty fees resulting from the implementation of provisions of the CARD Act and a reduction in customer accounts.
Provision for Loan and Lease Losses: The provision for loan and lease losses related to our Credit Card business decreased by $2.9 billion in 2010, to $3.2 billion.The substantial reduction in the provision was driven by improved credit trends, as evidenced by a reduction in the net charge-off rate and a decrease and stabilization of delinquency rates throughout the year, as well as lower period-end loan balances.As a result of the more positive credit performance trends and reduced loan balances, the Credit Card business recorded a net allowance release (after taking into consideration the $4.2 billion addition to the allowance on January 1, 2010 from the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards) of $2.3 billion in 2010.In comparison, our Credit Card business recorded an allowance release of $611 million in 2009.The release in 2009 was driven by the reduction in period-end loans, which more than offset the impact of the continued deterioration in the credit performance of our credit card portfolio due to the severe economic downturn.
Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $212 million, or 6%, in 2010. The increase reflects the impact of an increase in marketing expenses, which has been partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses due to the reduction in customer accounts and targeted cost savings across our Credit Card business.As the economy gradually improved, we increased our marketing expenditures during 2010 from suppressed levels in 2009 to attract and support new business volume through a variety of channels.
Total Loans: Period-end loans in the Credit Card business declined by $7.2 billion, or 10%, in 2010, to $61.4 billion as of December 31, 2010, from $68.5 billion as of December 31, 2009.Approximately $3.2 billion of the decrease was due to the run-off of installment loans in our Domestic Card division.The remaining decrease, which was partially offset by the addition of the Sony Card portfolio, was attributable to elevated net charge-offs, weak consumer demand and historically lower marketing expenditures in 2009 and 2010 as result of the severe economic downturn.
Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics: Although net charge-off and delinquency rates remain elevated, these rates continued to improve throughout 2010.The net charge-off rate decreased to 8.79% in 2010, from 9.15% in 2009.The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased to 4.29% as of December 31, 2010, from 5.88% as of December 31, 2009.Based on continued improvement and stabilization of credit performance, we believe net charge-offs for our Credit Card business resulting from the severe economic downturn peaked in the first quarter of 2010.
Key factors affecting the results of our Credit Card business for 2009, compared with 2008 included the following:  Net Interest Income: Our Credit Card business experienced a modest increase in net interest income of $78 million, or 1%, in 2009, as higher interest margins slightly offset the reduction in net interest income attributable to declining loan balances.
41 Table of Contents  Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income decreased by $931 million, or 20 %, to $3.7 billion, primarily due to lower fees as a result of a reduction in customer accounts and significantly lower purchase volume.The severe economic downturn led to a contraction in consumer spending, which reduced overlimit fee income.
Provision for Loan and Lease Losses: The provision for loan and lease losses related to our Credit Card business of $6.1 billion in 2009 remained elevated at relatively the same level as 2008, reflecting the impact of continued weak credit performance in 2009 due to the severe economic downturn that began in 2008.Despite the elevated provision, we recorded an allowance release of $611 million in 2009 driven by the reduction in period-end loans.
Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense decreased by $665 million, or 15%, in 2009.
This decrease was driven by a substantial reduction in marketing expenses, by more than half, attributable to the severe economic downturn and lower operating expenses.The reduction in operating expenses reflected the impact of favorable exchangein our U.K. and the run-off of our closed-end loan portfolio.
Total Loans: Period-end loans in the Credit Card business declined by $11.2 billion, or 14%, in 2009, to $68.5 billion as of December 31, 2009.Approximately 43% of the decline was attributable to the run-off of the closed end loan portfolio.The remaining decline was driven by reduced purchase volume in our revolving credit card businesses and elevated net charge-offs.We added fewer new customer accounts during 2009 and existing customers maintained lower balances, partially attributable to the curtailment of our marketing expenditures during 2009 as well as the uncertain economic environment.
Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics: The substantial increase in the net charge-off rate to 9.15% in 2009, from 6.26% in 2008 was attributable to the significant deterioration in credit performance as a result of the severe economic downturn that began in 2008, which resulted in rising unemployment and higher loan default rates throughout 2009.Virtually all of our credit metrics were adversely affected by economic conditions, including the 30+ day delinquency rate, which increased to 5.88% as of December 31, 2009, from 4.86% as of December 31, 2008.
Table 7.1 summarizes the financial results for Domestic Card and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.Domestic Card accounted for 87% of total revenues for our Credit Card business in 2010, compared with 89% in 2009 and 87% in 2008. Income attributable to Domestic Card represented 83% of income for our Credit Card business for 2010, compared with 94% in both 2009 and 2008. Because our Domestic Card business currently accounts for the substantial majority of our Credit Card business, the key factors driving the results for this division are similar to the key factors affecting our total Credit Card business.

Income generated by our Domestic Card division of $1.9 billion in 2010, represented an increase of $980 million over 2009. The primary factors affecting Domestic Card results for 2010 compared with 2009 included a decline in total revenue due in part to lower loan balances and a reduction in overlimit and other penalty fees; a significant reduction in the provision for loan and lease losses as we recorded a substantial allowance release in response to more positive credit performance trends, including decreases in charge-off and delinquency rates, and an increase in non-interest expense attributable to higher marketing expenditures.
Income generated by our Domestic Card division of $918 million in 2009, reflected a decrease of $80 million from 2008. The primary factors affecting Domestic Card results for 2009 compared with 2008 included a decline in total revenue primarily due to reduced fees resulting from the reduction in customer accounts and significantly lower purchase volume, a continued elevated provision for loan and lease losses due to credit performance deterioration and a decrease in non-interest expense due to significantly curtailed marketing expenditures.
Table 7.2 summarizes the financial results for International Card and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.International Card accounted for 13% of total revenues for our Credit Card business in 2010, compared with 11% in 2009 and 13% in 2008.Income attributable to International Card represented 17% of income for our Credit Card business for 2010, compared with 6% in both 2009 and 2008.

Income generated by our International Card division of $376 million in 2010 increased $316 million from 2009.The most significant driver of the improvement in results was a $386 million decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses in 2010.As a result of decreases in charge-off and delinquency rates, we recorded a substantial allowance release of $256 million in 2010, compared with an allowance release of $20 million in 2009.
In addition, total revenue increased by $64 million, primarily due to the impact of pricing changes implemented during 2009 that resulted in increases in average asset yields that were partially offset by a decline in loan balances.
Income generated by our International Card division of $60 million in 2009 decreased by $9 million from 2008, attributable to a decrease in total revenue and an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses that more than offset a reduction in non-interest expense.The decline in revenue was due to the combined impact of foreign exchange fluctuations and a decline in customer accounts, which resulted in lower fees.Although loan balances declined, the provision for loan and lease losses increased due to deterioration in credit performance during 2009 as a result of weak economic conditions in Canada and the U.K.
Consumer Banking Business Our Consumer Banking business generated income of $905 million in 2010, compared with income of $244 million in 2009 and a loss of $980 million in 2008.The loss in 2008 was largely attributable to goodwill impairment of $811 million.The primary sources of revenue for our Consumer Banking business are net interest income and non-interest income from customer fees.Expenses primarily consist of ongoing operating costs, such as salaries and associated benefits, communications and other technology expenses, supplies and equipment and occupancy costs.

(2) Average loans held for investment used in calculating net charge-off rates includes the impact ofloans acquired as part of the Chevy Chase Bank acquisition. The net charge-off rate, excluding loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank from the denominator, was 2.16% and 3.17% in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
(3) Our calculation of nonperforming loan and asset ratios includes the impact of loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank. However, we do not report loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank as nonperforming, as we recorded these loans at estimated fair value when we acquired them. The nonperforming loan ratio, excluding the impact of loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank from the denominator, was 2.30% and 1.75% as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and real-estate owned (REO). The nonperforming asset rate is calculated by dividing nonperforming assets as of the end of the period by period-end loans held for investment and REO. The nonperforming asset rate, excluding loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank from the denominator, was 2.54% and 1.93% as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
(4) The 30+ day performing delinquency rate, excluding loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank from the denominator, was 5.01% as of December 31, 2010 and 6.10% as of December 31, 2009.
(5) As a result of the January 1, 2010 adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards, we added $73 million to the allowance related to our Consumer Banking business on January 1, 2010, resulting in an allowance of $1.1 billion as of January 1, 2010.The allowance decreased during the remainder of 2010 by $474 million, or 43%.
Key factors affecting the results of our Consumer Banking business for 2010, compared with 2009 included the following:  Net Interest Income: Our Consumer Banking business experienced an increase in net interest income of $496 million, or 15%, in 2010.The primary drivers of the increase in net interest income were improved loan margins, primarily resulting from higher pricing for new auto loan originations, deposit growth resulting from our continued strategy to leverage our banking branches to attract lower cost funding sources and improved deposit spreads. The favorable impact from these factors more than offset the decline in average loans held for investment resulting from the continued run-off of home loans and reduction in auto loans in 2010.
Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $115 million, or 15%, in 2010.The increase was primarily attributable to a gain of $128 million recorded in the first quarter of 2010 related to the deconsolidation of certain option-adjustable rate mortgage trusts that were consolidated on January 1, 2010 as a result of our adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards.
Provision for Loan and Lease Losses: The provision for loan and lease losses decreased by $635 million in 2010, to $241 million. The substantial reduction in the provision was attributable to continued improvement in credit performance trends and reduced loan balances.Delinquency and charge-off rates declined throughout the year, reflecting the impact of the gradual improvement in economic conditions and the higher credit quality of our most recent auto loan vintages.As a result, the Consumer Banking business recorded a net allowance release (after taking into consideration the impact of the $73 million addition to the allowance on January 1, 2010 from the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards) of $474 million in 2010.In comparison, the Consumer Banking business recorded an allowance release of $238 million in 2009, primarily due to declining loan balances.
Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $216 million, or 8%, in 2010. This increase was largely attributable to infrastructure expenditures, primarily in our home loan and retail banking operations, made in 2010 to attract and support new business volume and to integrate Chevy Chase Bank, and increased marketing expenditures related to our retail banking operations.
45 Table of Contents  Total Loans: Period-end loans in the Consumer Banking business declined by $3.8 billion, or 10%, in 2010 to $34.4 billion as of December 31, 2010, from $38.2 billion as of December 31, 2009, primarily due to the run-off of home loans and a reduction in auto loan balances.
Deposits: Period-end deposits in the Consumer Banking business increased by $8.8 billion, or 12%, during 2010 to $83.0 billion as of December 31, 2010, reflecting the impact of our strategy to replace maturing higher cost wholesale funding sources with lower cost funding sources and our increased retail marketing efforts to attract new business to meet this objective.
Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics: The net charge-off and delinquency rates for the Consumer Banking business, improved during 2010 as a result of the improved economic environment and a tightening of our underwriting standards on new loan originations.The net charge-off rate decreased to 1.82% as of December 31, 2010, down significantly from the net charge-off rate of 2.74% as of December 31, 2009.The 30+ day performing delinquency rate, which was 4.28% as of December 31, 2010, has declined from a rate of 5.06% as of December 31, 2009.
Key factors affecting the results of our Consumer Banking business for 2009, compared with 2008 included the following:  Net Interest Income: Our Consumer Banking business experienced an increase in net interest income of $243 million, or 8%, in 2009, primarily attributable to the acquisition of the Chevy Chase Bank portfolio in the first quarter of 2009.
Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $26 million, or 4%, in 2009, primarily driven by the acquisition of the Chevy Chase Bank portfolio in the first quarter of 2009.
Provision for Loan and Lease Losses: The provision for loan and lease losses declined by $658 million, or 43%, in 2009.The decrease was primarily driven by reduced losses and shrinkage in our auto loan business, partially offset by allowance builds in the retail banking and home loan businesses.
Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense decreased by $530 million, or 16%, in 2009. Excluding the impact of goodwill impairment of $811 million recognized in 2009, non-interest expense increased by $281 million over 2008.This increase was driven by incremental operating costs from the Chevy Chase acquisition and increased loan workout and mitigation costs in the home loan business, which was partially offset by a significant decrease in marketing expenditures .
Total Loans: Period-end loans in the Consumer Banking business increased by $1.0 billion, or 3%, to $38.2 billion as of December 31, 2009, primarily due to the acquisition of the Chevy Chase mortgage portfolio.
Deposits: Period-end deposits increased by $12.4 billion, or 20%, to $74.1 as of December 31, 2009, primarily due to the acquisition of Chevy Chase Bank.
Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics: The improvement in the net charge-off rate of 2.74% in 2009, compared with 3.09% in 2008 was primarily driven by more positive credit performance in the auto business resulting from a larger proportion of higher quality loans originated in 2008 and 2009 and improvements in auto auction recovery price.The 30+ day performing delinquency rate also declined to 5.06% as of December 31, 2009, from 6.31% as of December 31, 2008.
Commercial Banking Business Our Commercial Banking business generated income of $160 million in 2010, compared with a loss of $213 million in 2009 and income of $254 million in 2008.The primary sources of revenue for our Commercial Banking business are net interest income and non-interest income from customer fees.Expenses primarily consist of ongoing operating costs, such as salaries and associated benefits, communications and other technology expenses, supplies and equipment and occupancy costs.

(2) Our calculation of nonperforming loan and asset ratios includes the impact of loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank. However, we do not report loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank as nonperforming, as we recorded these loans at estimated fair value when we acquired them. The nonperforming loan ratio, excluding the impact of loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank from the denominator, was 1.69% and 2.43% as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.The nonperforming asset rate, excluding loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank from the denominator, was 1.83% and 2.62% as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Key factors affecting the results of our Commercial Banking business for 2010, compared with 2009 included the following:  Net Interest Income: Our Commercial Banking business experienced an increase in net interest income of $148 million, or 13%, in 2010.The increase was driven by strong deposit growth, improved deposit spreads resulting from repricing of higher rate deposits to lower rates in response to the overall lower interest rate environment, and higher average loan yields driven by wider spreads on new originations.
47 Table of Contents  Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $9 million, or 5%, in 2010 to $181 million, largely attributable to growth in fees in the middle market segment, which was partially offset by a loss on the disposition of a legacy portfolio of small-ticket commercial real estate loans.
Provision for Loan and Lease Losses: The provision for loan and lease losses decreased by $554 million in 2010, to $429 million.
The substantial reduction in the provision was attributable to improvements in charge-off and nonperforming loan rates throughout the year, which resulted in a reduction in our allowance build.We recorded an allowance build of $41 million in 2010, compared with an allowance build of $484 million in 2009.
Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $135 million, or 20%, in 2010 to $796 million. The increase was attributable to higher loan workout expenses and losses related to REO, combined with increases in core deposit intangible amortization expense, integration costs related to the Chevy Chase Bank acquisition and expenditures related to risk management activities and enhancing our infrastructure.
Total Loans: Period-end loans in the Commercial Banking business increased by $129 million, or less than 1%, to $29.7 billion as of December 31, 2010. The slight increase was due to modest loan growth, which was partially offset by the disposition of the legacy portfolio of small-ticket commercial real estate loans.
Deposits: Period-end deposits increased by $2.1 billion, or 10%, to $22.6 billion as of December 31, 2010, driven by our increased effort to build and expand commercial relationships.
Charge-off and Nonperforming Loan Statistics : Credit metrics in our Commercial Banking business remain elevated, but have significantly improved since the second half of 2009 as a result of the improved economic environment and our risk management activities. The net charge-off rate decreased to 1.32% in 2010, from 1.45% in 2009.The nonperforming loan rate declined to 1.66% as of December 31, 2010, from 2.37% as of December 31, 2009.
Key factors affecting the results of our Commercial Banking business for 2009, compared with 2008 included the following:  Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by $182 million, or 19%, in 2009, largely driven by reduced interest expense on deposits that more than offset the impact of reduced loan margins.
Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $28 million, or 19%, to $172 million, primarily driven by the acquisition of Chevy Chase Bank, and growth in treasury management, public finance and investment banking fees.
Provision for Loan and Lease Losses: The provision for loan and lease losses increased by $749 million to $983 million in 2009.The increase was driven by higher charge offs as well as higher loan loss allowance build as the credit environment deteriorated in 2009.
Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $180 million, or 37%, in 2009 to $661 million.The increase in expense was largely driven by increases in associates and related salaries and benefits as part of our efforts to enhance our infrastructure and restructure our operating model.In addition, we incurred increased costs related to loan workout and loss mitigation activities due to an increase in problem loans resulting from the severe economic downturn.
Total Loans: Period-end loans in the Commercial Banking business increased by $235 million, or 1%, to $29.6 billion as of December 31, 2009.The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of the Chevy Chase Bank commercial loan portfolio.
Deposits: Period-end deposits increased by $4.0 billion, or 24%, to $20.5 billion as of December 31, 2009. The increase was mainly due to the acquisition of Chevy Chase Bank and our strategy to leverage our bank outlets to attract lower cost funding sources.
Charge-off and Nonperforming Loan Statistics :Credit metrics deteriorated throughout much of 2009 due to the severe economic downturn, which resulted in rising unemployment and significant declines in property values.The net charge-off rate rose to 1.45% in 2009, from 0.29% in 2008, and the nonperforming loan rate increased to 2.37% as of December 31, 2009, from 1.66% as of December 31, 2008.
48 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS AND CREDIT PERFORMANCE Total assets of $197.5 billion as of December 31, 2010, after taking into consideration the $41.9 billion of assets added to our balance sheet on January 1, 2010 as a result of the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards,decreased by $27.9 billion, or 8%, during 2010. Total liabilities of $171.0 billion as of December 31, 2010, after taking into consideration the $44.3 billion of securitization debt added to our balance sheet on January 1, 2010 as a result of the adoption of the new consolidation standards, decreased by $16.4 billion, or 12%, during 2010. Our stockholders equity, after taking into account the cumulative effect after-tax charge of $2.9 billion to retained earnings on January 1, 2010 from the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards, increased by $2.8 billion during 2010, to $26.5 billion as of December 31, 2010. The increase in stockholders equity was primarily attributable to our net income of $2.7 billion in 2010.
Following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during 2010.
Investment Securities Our investment securities portfolio, which had a fair value of $41.5 billion and $38.9 billion, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, consists of the following: U.S. Treasury and U.S. agency debt obligations; agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities; other asset-backed securities collateralized primarily by credit card loans, auto loans, student loans, auto dealer floor plan inventory loans, equipment loans and home equity lines of credit; municipal securities; and limited Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) equity securities.Our investment securities portfolio continues to be heavily concentrated in securities that generally have lower credit risk and high credit ratings, such as securities issued and guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury and government sponsored enterprises or agencies.Our investments in U.S. Treasury and agency securities, based on fair value, represented approximately 70% of our total investment securities portfolio as of December 31, 2010, compared with 75% as of December 31, 2009.
All of our investment securities were classified as available for sale as of December 31, 2010 and reported in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Table 10 presents the amortized cost and fair value for the major categories of our investment securities as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

The book value ofFannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae investments exceeded 10% of our stockholders equity as of December 31, 2010.
49 Table of Contents (3) Consists of securities collateralized by credit card loans, auto loans, student loans, auto dealer floor plan inventory loans, equipment loans and home equity lines of credit. The distribution among these asset types was approximately 77.8% credit card loans, 6.7% auto loans, 7.2% student loans, 5.6% auto dealer floor plan inventory loans, 2.5% equipment loans and 0.2% home equity lines of credit as of December 31, 2010.In comparison, the distribution was approximately 76.3% credit card loans, 14.0% auto loans, 6.9% student loans, 1.7% auto dealer floor plan inventory loans, 0.8% equipment loans and 0.3% home equity lines of credit as of December 31, 2009.Approximately 90% of the securities in our asset-backed security portfolio were rated AAA or its equivalent as of December 31, 2010, compared with 84% as of December 31, 2009.
(4) Consists of municipal securities and equity investments, primarily related to CRA activities.
(5) Consists of negative amortization mortgage-backed securities.
Unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale securities are recorded net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).We had gross unrealized gains of $830 million and gross unrealized losses of $281 million on available-for sale securities as of December 31, 2010, compared with gross unrealized gains of $840 million and gross unrealized losses of $549 million as of December 31, 2009.The decrease in gross unrealized losses in 2010 was primarily driven by a tightening of credit spreads, attributable to the improvement in credit performance and increased liquidity, and lower interest rates.Of the $281 million gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2010, $137 million related to securities that had been in a loss position for more than 12 months.
We evaluate available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position as of the end of each quarter for other-than-temporary impairment based on a number of criteria, including the extent and duration of the decline in value, the severity and duration of the impairment, recent events specific to the issuer and/or industry to which the issuer belongs, the payment structure of the security, external credit ratings and the failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments, the value of underlying collateral, our intent and ability to hold the security and current market conditions.
Other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in earnings if one of the following conditions exists: (1) a decision to sell the security has been made; (2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the impairment is recovered; or (3) the amortized cost basis is not expected to be recovered. If, however, we have not made a decision to sell the security and we do not expect that we will be required to sell prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis, only the credit component of other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in earnings. The noncredit component is recorded in AOCI. The credit component is the difference between the securitys amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows discounted based on the original yield, while the noncredit component is the remaining difference between the securitys fair value and amortized cost.
We recognized net OTTI ondebt securities of $65 million, $32 million and $11 million for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, due in part to deterioration in the credit performance of certain securities resulting from the continued weaknesses in the housing market, high unemployment, and our decision to sell certain other securities before recovery of the impairment amount.
We provide additional information on our available-for-sale securities in Note 4Investment Securities.
Total Loans Total loans that we manage consist of held-for-investment loans recorded on our balance sheet and loans held in our securitization trusts.Prior to our January 1, 2010 adoption of the new consolidation standards, a portion of our managed loans were accounted for as off-balance sheet. Loans underlying our securitization trusts are now reported on our consolidated balance sheets in restricted loans for securitization investors.Table 11 presents the composition of our total loan portfolio, by business segments, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Our total reported loans declined by $10.9 billion, or 8.0%, during the year ended December 31, 2010 to $125.9 billion as of December 31, 2010, from managed loans of $136.8 billion as of December 31, 2009.The decline was primarily due to the run-off of loans in businesses that we either exited or repositioned early in the economic recession, elevatedcharge-offs and weak consumer demand. The run-offs are related to installment loans included in our Credit Card business, home loans in our Consumer Banking business and small-ticket commercial real estate loans in our Commercial Banking business. Additionally, the decline was attributable tothe sale of a portion of the small-ticket commercial real estate loan portfolio in 2010.The decline was partially offset by the acquisition of the $807 million legacy Sony Card portfolio in the third quarter of 2010.

The Credit Card segment accounted for $61.4 billion, or 49% of our total loan portfolio as of December31, 2010, compared with 50% as of December 31, 2009. Because of the diversity of our credit card products and national marketing approach, no single geographic concentration exists within the credit card portfolio. Table 13 displays the geographic concentration of our credit card loan portfolio as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.

It is well diversified with some concentration in Texas, California and Louisiana. The home loan portfolio is concentrated in New York, California and Louisiana which reflects the characteristics of the legacy Hibernia, North Fork and Chevy Chase Bank portfolios that comprise the majority of our home loans. Other retail lending includes our branch and banker based small business loans as well as other consumer lending products originated through the branch network. These portfolios are concentrated in our retail branch geographies. See Table 14Consumer Banking Concentrations (Managed) for further details.

Trends in delinquency ratios are an indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within our loan portfolios. The level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. Accordingly, key metrics we track and use in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates, as well as charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance, commercial loans. High unemployment, the decline in home prices and other weak economic conditions resulting from the recent recession adversely affected the ability of consumers and businesses to meet their debt obligations and resulting in deterioration across all of our loan portfolios in 2009. As economic conditions began to improve in 2010, credit performance across our loan categories began to improve and stabilize.We present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio.
See Note 5Loans for additional details.
Delinquency Rates We consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimumrequired payment is not received by thefirst statement cycle date equal to or following the due date specified on the customer's billing statement.Table 16 below compares 30+ day performing loan delinquency rates, by loan category, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.This table excludes delinquent loans classified as nonperforming.The delinquency rates presented are calculated, by loan category, based on our total loan portfolio.Our total loan portfolio consists of loans recorded on our balance sheet, which includes loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank, and loans held in our securitization trusts, which we previously referred to as our managed loan portfolio.Loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank were recorded at fair value at acquisition.Because the fair value of these loans included an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, we do not report these loans as delinquent unless they do not perform in accordance with our expectations as of the purchase date.

Delinquency rates for all loan categories, except commercial and multifamily real estate, showed signs of improvement during 2010, reflecting positive trends in credit conditions. In addition, the diminishing initial adverse impact from the pricing changes we made during 2009 contributed to a reduction in the delinquency rate for domestic credit cards.
Table 17 presents an aging of 30+ day performing delinquent loans included in the above table.All loans included are on accrual status.

The amounts reported for credit card loans are net of billed finance charges and fees that we do not expect to collect.In accordance with our finance charge and fee revenue recognition policy, amounts billed but not included in revenue totaled $950 million, $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion in2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Credit card loans 90 days or greater past due which continue to accrue interest totaled $1.4 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
55 Table of Contents Table 18 summarizes loans that were 90 days or more past due as to interest or principal and still accruing interest as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.These loans consist primarily of credit card accounts between 90 days and 179 days past due.As permitted by regulatory guidance issued by The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC),we continue to accrue interest on credit card loans through the date of charge-off, typically in the period the account becomes 180 days past due.While credit card loans remain on accrual status until the loan is charged-off, we establish a reserve for finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue.
Table 18:90+ Days Delinquent Loans Accruing Interest December 31, 2010 2009 (Dollars in millions) Amount % of Total Loans Amount % of Total Loans Loan category: Credit card $ 1,379 1.10 % $ 2,054 1.50 % Consumer 5  58 0.04 Commercial 14 0.01 11 0.01 Total $ 1,398 1.11 % $ 2,123 1.55 % Geographic region: Domestic $ 1,195 0.95 % $ 1,838 1.34 % International 203 0.16 285 0.21 Total $ 1,398 1.11 % $ 2,123 1.55 % Nonperforming Assets Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and foreclosed property and repossessed assets.Nonperforming loans generally include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and certain restructured loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty.We do not report loans accounted for under the fair value option and loans held for sale as nonperforming.
Our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming, by loan category, are as follows:  Credit card loans: As permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), our policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being classified as nonperforming as these loans are generally charged off in the period the account becomes 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, we generally continue to accrue interest and fees on delinquent credit card loans until the loans are charged-off.When we do not expect full payment of billed finance charges and fees, we reduce the balance of the credit card account by the estimated uncollectible portion of any billed finance charges and fees and exclude this amount from revenue.
Consumer loans: We classify other non-credit card consumer loans as nonperforming at the earlier of the date when we determine that the collectability of interest or principal on the loan is not reasonably assured or when the loan is 90 days past due for automobile and mortgage loans, 180 days past due for unsecured small business revolving lines of credit and120 days past due for all other non-credit card consumer loans, including installment loans.
Commercial loans : We classify commercial loans as nonperforming at the earlier of the date we determine that the collectability of interest or principal on the loan is not reasonably assured or the loan is 90 days past due.
Modified loans and troubled debt restructurings: Modified loans, including TDRs, that are current at the time of the restructuring remain on accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and continued performance under the modified terms is expected. Otherwise, the modified loan is classified as nonperforming and placed on nonaccrual status until the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance over several payment cycles, generally six months of consecutive payments, under the modified terms of the loan.
Purchased credit-impaired loans : PCI loans primarily include loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank, which we recorded at fair value at acquisition.Because the initial fair value of these loans included an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, our subsequent accounting for PCI loans differs from the accounting for non-PCI loans.We therefore separately track and report PCI loans and exclude these loans from our delinquency and nonperforming loan statistics.
56 Table of Contents Table 19 presents comparative information on nonperforming loans, by loan category, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the ratio of nonperforming loans to our total loans.Nonperforming loans held for sale are excluded from nonperforming loans, as they are recorded at lower of cost or fair value.

The denominator used in calculating the nonperforming asset ratios consists of total loans held for investment and other nonperforming assets.
(2) Our calculation of nonperforming loan and asset ratios includes the impact of loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank.However, we do not report loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank as nonperforming unless they do not perform in accordance with our expectations as of the purchase date, as we recorded these loans at estimated fair value when we acquired them. The nonperforming loan ratios, excluding the impact of loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank, for commercial and multifamily real estate, middle market, total commercial banking, home loans, retail banking, total consumer banking, and total nonperforming loans held for investment were 2.11%, 1.30%, 1.69%, 6.67%, 2.16%, 2.30% and 1.02%, respectively, as of December 31, 2010, compared with 3.18%, 1.07%, 2.43%, 3.75%, 1.78%, 1.75%, and 0.99%, respectively, as of December 31, 2009.The nonperforming asset ratio, excluding loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank, was 1.29% and 1.19% as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
(3) Nonperforming loans as a percentage of loans held for investment, excluding credit card loans from the denominator, was 1.90% and 1.89% as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
(4) Includes $201 million and $154 million of foreclosed properties related to loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
(5) Forgone interest income represents the amount of interest income that would have been recorded during theyear for nonperforming loans as of the end of theyear had the loans performed according to their contractual terms.
(6) Represents interest income recognized during theyear for on-balance sheet loans classified as nonperforming as of the end of each year.
57 Table of Contents The increase in our nonperforming loan ratio to 0.97% as of December 31, 2010, from 0.94% as of December 31, 2009 was primarily attributable to the weak economy, decline in property values and high unemployment, which continued to have an adverse impact on our commercial and home loan portfolios.
Total nonperforming loans included TDRs totaling $96 million and $20 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Net Charge-Offs Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and fraud losses from charge-offs.Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Costs incurred to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expense and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense. Our charge-off time frame for loans, which varies based on the loan type, is presented below.
Credit card loans: We generally charge-off credit card loans when the account is 180 days past due from the statement cycle date. Credit card loans in bankruptcy are charged-off within 30 days of receipt of a complete bankruptcy notification from the bankruptcy court, except for U.K. credit card loans, which are charged-off within 60 days.Credit card loans of deceased account holders are charged-off within 60 days of receipt of notification.
Consumer loans: Wegenerally charge-off consumer loans at the earlier of the date when the account is a specified number of days past due or upon repossession of the underlying collateral. Our charge-off time frame is 180 days for mortgage loans and unsecured small business lines of credit and 120 days for auto and other non-credit cardconsumer loans.We calculate the charge-off amount for mortgage loans based on the difference betweenour recorded investment in the loanand thefair value of the underlying property and estimated selling costsas of the date of the charge-off. We update our home value estimates on a regular basis and recognize additional charge-offs for declines in home values below our initial fair value and selling cost estimate at the date mortgage loans are charged-off.Consumer loans in bankruptcy, except for auto and mortgage loans, generally arecharged-off within40 days of receipt ofnotification from the bankruptcy court.Auto and mortgage loans in bankruptcyare charged-off in the period that the loan is both 60 days or more past due and 60 days or more past the bankruptcy notification date or in the period the loan becomes 120 days past due for auto loans and 180 days past due for mortgage loans regardless of the bankruptcy notification date. Consumer loans of deceased account holders are charged-off within 60 days of receipt of notification.
Commercial loans : We charge-off commercial loans in the period we determine that the unpaid principal loan amounts are uncollectible.
Purchased credit-impaired loans :We do not record charge-offs on purchased-credit impaired loans that are performing in accordance with or better than our expectations as of the date of acquisition, as the fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component.We record charge-offs on purchased credit-impaired loans only if actual losses exceed estimated losses incorporated into the fair value recorded at acquisition.
Table 20 presents our net charge-off amounts and rates, by business segment, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.We provide additional information on the amount of charge-offs by loan category below in Table 22.
Table 20: Net Charge-Offs (1) Year Ended December31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Managed; Amount Rate (2) Amount Rate (2) Amount Rate (2) Credit card $ 5,505 8.79 % $ 6,688 9.15 % $ 4,956 6.26 % Consumer banking (3)(4) 655 1.82 1,094 2.74 1,218 3.09 Commercial banking (3)(4) 390 1.32 434 1.45 83 0.29 Other 107 21.18 205 (5) 37.11 168 30.87 Total company (4) $ 6,657 5.18 % $ 8,421 5.87 % $ 6,425 4.35 % Average loans held for investment (6) $ 128,622 $ 143,514 $ 147,812 Reported: Total company charge-offs 6,651 5.18 % 4,568 4.58 % 3,478 3.51 % Average loans heid for investments (6) 128,526 99,787 98,971 ____________ (1) Net charge-offs reflect charge-offs, net of recoveries, related to our total loan portfolio, which we previously referred to as our managed loan portfolio. The total loan portfolio includes loans recorded on our balance sheet and loans held in our securitization trusts.
(2) Calculated for each loan category by dividing annualized net charge-offs for the period divided by average loans held for investment during the period.
58 Table of Contents (3) Excludes losses on the purchased credit-impaired loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank unless they do not perform in accordance with our expectations as of the purchase date.
(4) The average loans held for investment used in calculating net charge-off rates includes the impact of loans acquired as part of the Chevy Chase Bank acquisition. Our total net charge-off rate, excluding the impact of acquired Chevy Chase Bank loans, was 5.44% and 6.09% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
(5) During the first quarter of 2009, loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank were included in the Other category.
(6) The average balances of the acquired Chevy Chase Bank loan portfolio, which are included in the total average loans held for investment used in calculating the net charge-off rates, were $6.3 billion and $6.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
The overall decrease in net charge-offs in 2010 from 2009 reflects the ongoing improvement in credit performance since the end of 2009, as well as declining loan balances.The overall increase in net charge-offs in 2009 from 2008 was predominately due to the continued economic downturn, which persisted in 2009.
Loan Modifications and Restructurings As part of our customer retention efforts, we may modify loans for certain borrowers who have demonstrated performance under the previous terms.As part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may make loan modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty that are intended to minimize our economic lossand avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral.We may provide short-term (three to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to improve the long-term collectability of the loan.Our most common types of modifications include a reduction in the borrowers initial monthly or quarterly principal and interest payment through an extension of the loan term, a reduction in the interest rate, or a combination of both.These modifications may result in our receiving the full amount due, or certain installments due, under the loan over a period of time that is longer than the period of time originally provided for under the terms of the loan.In some cases, we may curtail the amount of principal owed by the borrower.Loan modifications in which an economic concession has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty are accounted for and reported as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs).
Table 21 presents the unpaid principal balance as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 of loan modifications made as part of our loss mitigation efforts, all of which are considered to be TDRs.Table 21 excludes acquired loans from Chevy Chase Bank that were restructured prior to acquisition, which we track and report separately below under "PurchasedCredit - Impaired Loans." Table 21: Loan Modifications and Restructurings (1) December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Modified and restructured loans: Credit card (2) $ 912 $ 678 Home loans 57 10 Commercial retail and multifamily real estate 153 41 Other retail 23 4 Total $ 1,145 $ 733 Status of modified and restructured loans: Performing $ 1,049 $ 713 Nonperforming 96 20 Total $ 1,145 $ 733 ____________ (1) Reflects modifications and restructuring of loans in our total loan portfolio, which we previously referred to as our managed loan portfolio. The total loan portfolio includes loans recorded on our balance sheet and loans held in our securitization trusts. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
(2) Amount reported reflects the total outstanding customer balance.
The outstanding balance of loan modifications made to assist borrowers experiencing financial difficulties increased to $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2010, from $733 million as December 31, 2009.Of these modifications, approximately $96 million, or 8%, were classified as nonperforming as of December 31, 2010, compared with $20 million, or 3%, as of December 31, 2009.
Credit card loan modifications have accounted for the substantial majority of our loan modifications, representing $912 million, or 80%, of the outstanding balance of total modified loans as of December 31, 2010, and $678 million, or 92%, of the outstanding balance of total modified loans as of December 31, 2009.The vast majority of our credit card loan modifications involve a reduction in the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months.In all cases, we cancel the customers available line of credit on the credit card.If the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement will revert back to its original payment terms, with the amount of any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency bucket.The loan amount may then be charged-off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy.
59 Table of Contents We typically measure the re-performance rate of modified credit card loans over a 5-year period. Five years after starting a credit card modification, approximately 84% of the balances of modified loans are paid off in full and approximately 16% are charged-off.Based on our experience to date, we believe that credit losses are lower for credit card loans that have been modified than those of similar accounts that were not modified. We therefore plan to ramp up our short-term credit card loan modification programs and continue our long-term programs.
Mortgage loan modifications represented $57 million, or 5%, of the outstanding balance of total modified loans as of December 31, 2010, compared with $10 million, or 1%, of the outstanding balance of total modified loans as of December 31, 2009. Approximately 76% of our modified mortgage loans include reduction in the contractual interest rate, approximately 17% include a term extension and approximately 5% include a principal reduction.The majority of our modified mortgage loans involve a combination of an interest rate reduction, term extension or principal reduction.Because many of the mortgage loan modification programs have been recently launched and we have had a limited number of modifications under these programs, we do not have sufficient history to fully assess the long-term performance of modified mortgage loans.Of the modified mortgage loans outstanding as of December 31, 2010, approximately 27% were 90 days or more delinquent.
Commercial loan modifications represented $153million, or 13%, of the outstanding balance of total modified loans as of December 31, 2010, compared with $41 million, or 6%, of the outstanding balance of total modified loans as of December 31, 2009.The vast majority of modified commercial loans include a reduction in interest rate or a term extension.Because we have had only a limited number of commercial loan modifications and the structure of each loan varies, the ultimate success of our commercial loan modifications is uncertain. Of the modified commercial loans outstanding as of December 31, 2010, approximately 22% were 90 days or more delinquent.
Impaired Loans A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan.
Loans defined as individually impaired, based on applicable accounting guidance, include larger balance commercial nonperforming loans and TDR loans.
We do not report nonperforming consumer loans that have not been modified in a TDR as individually impaired, as we collectively evaluate these smaller-balance homogenous loans for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.
Held for sale loans are also not reported as impaired, as these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value. Impaired loans also exclude loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank because these loans were recorded at fair value upon acquisition and loans held for sale because these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value.
Impaired loans, including TDRs, totaled $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2010, compared with $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2009.TDRs accounted for $1.1 billion and $733 million of impaired loans as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We provide additional information on our impaired loans, including the allowance established for these loans, in Note 5Loans and Note 6Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.
Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans Purchased credit-impaired loans decreased to $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2010, from $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2009. Our portfolio of purchased credit-impaired loans consists of loans acquired in the Chevy Chase Bank transaction, which were recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. The fair value of these loans included an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans. Therefore, no allowance for loan and lease losses was recorded for these loans as of the acquisition date. However, we regularly update the amount of expected principal and interest to be collected from these loans and evaluate the results on an aggregated pool basis for loans with common risk characteristics.If we determine that it is probable that the amount of expected cash flows for any pool is less than our recorded investment, we would recognize impairment through our provision for loan and lease losses. During 2010, we recorded impairmentof $33 million related to certain loan pools.The credit performance of the remaining pools has generally been in line with or, in some instances, better than we originally expected at the acquisition date.As a result, we reclassified $311 million from the nonaccretable difference to accretable yield during 2010.This increase in accretable yield will be recognized in interest income over the remaining life of these loans.We provide additional information on the loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank in Note 5Loans.
60 Table of Contents Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Our allowance for loan and lease losses represents managements best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent in our held-for-investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date.
We do not maintain an allowance for held-for-sale loans or purchased-credit impaired loans that are performing in accordance with or better than our expectations as of the date of acquisition, as the fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component.The allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for loan and lease losses and reduced by net charge-offs.The provision for loan and lease losses, which is charged to earnings, reflects credit losses we believe have been incurred and will eventually be reflected over time in our charge-offs.Charge-offs of uncollectible amounts are deducted from the allowance and subsequent recoveries are added.We describe our process for determining our allowance for loan and lease losses in Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
Table 22, which displays changes in our allowance for loan and lease losses for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, details, by loan type, the provision for credit losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income each period and the charge-offs recorded against our allowance for loan and lease losses.

Table 23: Allocation of the Reported Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses December 31, 2010 2009 (Dollars in millions) Amount % of Total Loans (1) Amount % of Total Loans (1) Credit Card: Domestic credit card and installment $ 3,581 6.65 % $ 1,927 9.60 % International credit card and installment 460 6.12 199 8.75 Total credit card 4,041 6.58 2,126 9.52 Consumer Banking: Automobile 353 1.98 665 3.66 Home loans 112 0.93 175 1.18 Retail banking 210 4.76 236 4.60 Total consumer banking 675 1.96 1,076 2.82 Commercial Banking: Commercial and multifamily real estate 495 3.70 471 3.40 Middle market 162 1.55 131 1.30 Specialty lending 91 2.26 90 2.54 Total commercial lending 748 2.68 692 2.52 Small-ticket commercial real estate 78 4.23 93 4.34 Total commercial banking 826 2.78 785 2.65 Other loans 86 19.07 140 30.91 Total $ 5,628 4.47 % $ 4,127 4.55 % Total allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of: Period-end loans $ 125,947 4.47 % $ 90,619 4.55 % Nonperforming loans (2) 1,225 459.43 1,289 320.17 Allowance for loan and lease losses, by loan category, as a percentage of: Credit card (30 + day performing delinquent loans) $ 2,632 153.53 % $ 1,308 162.54 % Consumer banking (30 + day performing delinquent loans) 1,473 42.94 1,932 51.86 Commercial banking (nonperforming loans) 495 166.87 702 111.82 ______________ (1) Calculated based on the allowance for loan and lease losses attributable to each loan category divided by the outstanding balance of loans within the specified loan category.
(2) As permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the FFEIC, our policy is generally not to classify credit card loans as nonperforming. We accrue interest on credit card loans through the date of charge-off, typically in the period that the loan becomes 180 days past due.The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans, excluding the allowance related to our credit card loans, was 129.55% as of December 31, 2010 and 155.33% as of December 31, 2009.
As a result of our prospective adoption on January 1, 2010 of the new consolidation accounting standards, we added to our consolidated balance sheet $41.9 billion of assets and $4.3 billion of related allowance for loan and lease losses, consisting primarily of credit card loan receivables underlying our consolidated securitization trusts. Our allowance for loan and lease losses, after taking into consideration the $4.3 billion addition from the January 1, 2010 adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards and subsequent related adjustments, decreased by $2.8 billion during 2010 to $5.6 billion.The reduction in our allowance reflected the continued improvement in credit performance trends across our portfolios as a result of the slowly improving economy coupled with actions we have taken over the past several years to tighten our underwriting standards and exit certain portfolios. While we reduced the amount of our allowance for loan and lease losses in 2010, our allowance as a percentage of our total loan portfolio also decreased to 4.47% as of December 31, 2010, from 4.55% as of December 31, 2009.
63 Table of Contents Deposits Our deposits have become our largest source of funding for our operations and asset growth. Total deposits increased by $6.4 billion, or 5.5%, in 2010, to $122.2 billion as of December 31, 2010 from $115.8 billion as of December 31, 2009.The increase in deposits was primarily driven by increases of $9.1 billion, $6.4 billion, and $1.6 billion in savings accounts, money market deposits, and non-interest bearing deposits, respectively, which was partially offset by a decrease of $9.7 billion in other consumer time deposits and $1.9 billion in certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more, reflecting our shift to more relationship driven, lower cost liquid savings and transaction accounts.We provide additional information on deposits, including the composition of our deposits, average outstanding balances, interest expense and yield, below in Liquidity and Funding.
Senior and Subordinated Notes and Other Borrowings Senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings decreased to $14.9 billion as of December 31, 2010, from $17.1 billion as of December 31, 2009.The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances.Because of the decrease in our loan portfolio and the increase in deposits during 2010, our funding needs were lower and we reduced our level of borrowings.We provide additional information on our borrowings in Note 10Deposits and Borrowings.
Securitized Debt Obligations Borrowings owed to securitization investors, after taking into consideration the addition of $44.3 billion of debt issued to third-party investors by securitization trusts that we were required to consolidate on January 1, 2010, as a result of the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards, decreased by $21.4 billion to $26.9 billion as of December 31, 2010, from $48.3 billion as of January 1, 2010.This decrease was attributable to pay downs and charge-offs of the loans underlying the securitization trusts and maturities.
Potential Mortgage Representation & Warranty Liabilities In recent years, we acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold them to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts.These subsidiaries are Capital One Home Loans, which was acquired in February 2005; GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. (GreenPoint), which was acquired in December 2006 as part of the North Fork acquisition; and Chevy Chase Bank, which was acquired in February 2009 and subsequently merged into CONA.
In connection with their sales of mortgage loans, the subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the loans compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser, including underwriting guidelines and the ongoing existence of mortgage insurance, and the loans compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws.The representations and warranties do not address the credit performance of the mortgage loans, but mortgage loan performance often influences whether a claim for breach of representation and warranty will be asserted and has an effect on the amount of any loss in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty.
Each of these subsidiaries may be required to repurchase mortgage loans in the event of certain breaches of these representations and warranties.In the event of a repurchase, the subsidiary is typically required to pay the then unpaid principal balance of the loan together with interest and certain expenses (including, in certain cases, legal costs incurred by the purchaser and/or others). The subsidiary then recovers the loan or, if the loan has been foreclosed, the underlying collateral.The subsidiary is exposed to any losses on the repurchased loans after giving effect to any recoveries on the collateral. In some instances, rather than repurchase the loans, a subsidiary may agree to make a cash payment to make an investor whole on losses or to settle repurchase claims. In addition, our subsidiaries may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur as a result of certain breaches of representations and warranties. In some cases, the amount of such losses could exceed the repurchase amount of the related loans.
These subsidiaries, in total, originated and sold to non-affiliates approximately $111 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans between 2005 and 2008, which are the years (or vintages) with respect to which our subsidiaries have received the vast majority of the repurchase requests and other related claims.
The following table sets forth the original principal balance of mortgage loan originations by vintage for the three general categories of purchasers of mortgage loans: 64 Table of Contents Table 24:Original Principal Balance of Mortgage Loans Originated and Sold to Third Parties Based on Category of Purchaser (Dollars in billions) 2005 2006 2007 2008 Total Government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) (1) $ 3 $ 3 $ 4 $ 1 $ 11 Insured Securitizations 9 8 1 0 18 Uninsured Securitizations and Other 33 30 16 3 82 Total $ 45 $ 41 $ 21 $ 4 $ 111 _______________ (1) GSEs include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Between 2005 and 2008, our subsidiaries sold an aggregate amount of $11 billion in original principal balance mortgage loans to the GSEs.
Of the $18 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans sold directly by our subsidiaries to private-label purchasers who placed the loans into securitizations supported by bond insurance (Insured Securitizations), approximately $13 billion original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have made repurchase requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries (Active Insured Securitizations), and the remaining approximately $5 billion original principalbalance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have not made repurchase requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries (Inactive Insured Securitizations).Insured Securitizations often allow the monoline bond insurer to act independently of the investors.Bond insurers typically have indemnity agreements directly with both the mortgage originators and the securitizers, and they often have super-majority rights within the trust documentation that allow them to direct trustees to pursue mortgage repurchase requests without coordination with other investors.
Because we do not service most of the loans our subsidiaries sold to others, we do not have complete information about the current ownership of the $82 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans not sold directly to GSEs or placed in Insured Securitizations.We have determined from third-party databases that about $39 billion original principal balance of these mortgage loans are currently held by private-label publicly issued securitizations not supported by bond insurance (Uninsured Securitizations).In contrast with the bond insurers in Insured Securitizations, investors in Uninsured Securitizations often face a number of legal and logistical hurdles before they can direct a securitization trustee to pursue mortgage repurchases, including the need to coordinate with a certain percentage of investors holding the securities and to indemnify the trustee for any litigation it undertakes. An additional approximately $30 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans were initially sold to private investors as whole loans.Of this amount, we believe approximately $10 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans were ultimately purchased by GSEs.For purposes of our reserves-setting process, we consider these loans to be private-label loans rather than GSE loans.We do not have information about the current holders or disposition of the remaining $13 billion original principal balance mortgage loans in this category.
With respect to the $111 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans originated and sold to others between 2005 and 2008, we estimate that approximately $45 billion in unpaid principal balance remains outstanding, approximately $12 billion in losses have been realized, and approximately $13 billion in unpaid principal balance is at least 90 days delinquent.Because we do not service most of the loans we sold to others, we do not have complete information about the underlying credit performance levels of these mortgage loans, but these amounts reflect our best estimates based on available data, including extrapolated estimates for the $13 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans about which we do not have information about the current holders.These estimates could change as we get additional data or refine our analysis.
As of December 31, 2010, the subsidiaries had open repurchase requests relating to approximately $1.6 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans as compared with $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2009.
Over the last year, the vast majority of new repurchase demands received and, as discussed below, almost all of our $816 million reserves, relate to the $24 billion of original principal balance of mortgage loans originally sold to the GSEs or to Active Insured Securitizations.Currently, repurchase demands predominantly relate to the 2006 and 2007 vintages.We have received relatively few repurchase demands from the 2008 and 2009 vintages, mostly because GreenPoint ceased originating mortgages in August 2007.
Table 25 sets forth information on pending repurchase requests by counterparty category and timing of initial repurchase request: 65 Table of Contents Table 25: Open Pipeline All Vintages (all entities) (1) (Dollars in millions) (All amounts are Original Principal Balance) Open Claims December31, 2009 Gross New Demands Received in 2010 Loans Repurchased/Made Wholein 2010 (2) Demands Rescinded in 2010 (2) Open Claims December31, 2010 GSEs $ 61 $ 204 $ (52 ) $ (87 ) $ 126 Insured Securitizations 366 645 (179 ) 0 832 Uninsured Securitizations and Others 588 104 (5 ) (22 ) 665 Total $ 1,015 $ 953 $ (236 ) $ (109 ) $ 1,623 (1) The open pipeline includes all repurchase requests ever received by our subsidiaries where either the requesting party has not formally rescinded the repurchase request and where our subsidiary has not agreed to either repurchase the loan at issue or make the requesting party whole with respect to its losses.Accordingly, repurchase requests denied by our subsidiaries and not pursued by the counterparty remain in the open pipeline.Moreover, repurchase requests submitted by parties without contractual standing to pursue repurchase requests are included within the open pipeline unless the requesting party has formally rescinded its repurchase request.Finally, the amounts reflected in this chart are original principal balance amounts and do not correspond to the losses our subsidiary would incur upon the repurchase of these loans.
(2) Activity in 2010 relates to repurchase demands from all years.
We have established representation and warranty reserves for losses that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary, including both litigation and non-litigation liabilities.These reserves are reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities.The reserve-setting process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires the application of judgment. We evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis.We build our representation and warranty reserves through the provision for repurchase losses, which we report in our consolidated statements of income as a component of non-interest income for loans originated and sold by Chevy Chase Bank and Capital One Home Loans and as a component of discontinued operations for loans originated and sold by GreenPoint.In establishing the representation and warranty reserves, we consider a variety of factors depending on the category of purchaser.
In establishing reserves for the $11 billion original principal balanceof GSE loans, we rely on the historical relationship between GSE loan losses and repurchase outcomes to estimate:(1) the percentage of current and future GSE loan defaults that we anticipate will result in repurchase requests from the GSEs over the lifetime of the GSE loans; and (2) the percentage of those repurchase requests that we anticipate will result in actual repurchases.We also rely on estimated collateral valuations and loss forecast models to estimate our lifetime liability on GSE loans.This reserving approach to the GSE loans reflects the historical interaction with the GSEs around repurchase requests.The GSEs have stronger contractual rights than non-GSE counterparties because GSE contracts typically do not contain prompt notice requirements for repurchase requests or materiality qualifications to the representations and warranties.Moreover, although we often disagree with the GSEs about the validity of their repurchase requests, we have established a negotiation pattern whereby the GSEs and our subsidiaries continually negotiate around individual repurchase requests, leading to the GSEs rescinding some repurchase requests and our subsidiaries agreeing in some cases to repurchase some loans or make the GSEs whole with respect to losses.Our lifetime representation and warranty reserves with respect to GSE loans are grounded in this history.
For the $13 billion original principal balance in Active Insured Securitizations, our reserving approach also reflects our historical interaction with monoline bond insurers around repurchase requests.Typically, monoline bond insurers allege a very high repurchase rate with respect to the mortgage loans in the Active Insured Securitization category.In response to these repurchase requests, our subsidiaries typically request information from the monoline bond insurers demonstrating that the contractual requirements around a valid repurchase request have been satisfied, such as, for example, the typical requirements that the counterparty promptly notify us upon discovery of any breach and that any breach materially and adversely affect the value of the mortgage loan at issue.In response to these requests for supporting documentation, monoline bond insurers typicallyinitiate litigation.Accordingly, our reserves within the Active Insured Securitization are not based upon the historical repurchase rate with monoline bond insurers, but rather upon the expected resolution of litigation with the monoline bond insurers.Every bond insurer within this category ispursuing a substantially similar litigation strategy either through active or probable litigation.Accordingly, our representation and warranty reserves for this category are litigation reserves.In establishing litigation reserves for this category, we consider current and future losses inherent within the securitization and apply legal judgment to the anticipated factual and legal record to estimate the lifetime legal liability for each securitization.Our estimated legal liability for each securitization within this category assumes that we will be responsible for only a portion of the losses inherent in each securitization.Our litigation reserves with respect to both the U.S. Bank Lawsuit and the DBSP Lawsuit, in each case as referenced below, are contained within the Active Insured Securitization reserve category.Further, our litigation reserves with respect to indemnification risks from certain representation and warranty lawsuits brought by monoline bond insurers against third-party securitizations sponsors, where GreenPoint provided some or all of the mortgage collateral within the securitization but is not a defendant in the litigation, are also contained within this category.
66 Table of Contents For the $5 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in the Inactive Insured Securitizationscategoryandthe $82 billion original principal balance of mortage loans in the Uninsured Securitizations and other whole loans sales categories, we establish reserves by relying on our historical repurchase rates to estimate repurchase liabilities over the next twelve (12) months.We do not believe we can estimate repurchase liability for these categories for a period longer than twelve (12) months because of the relatively sporadic nature of repurchase requests from these categories.Although we have not seen any significant activity from new counterparties from these categories, there has been a recent uptick in negotiation intensity from some counterparties who had submitted repurchase claims in earlier quarters with respect to whole loans.In addition, some Uninsured Securitization investors from this category have not made repurchase requests or filed representation and warranty lawsuits, but instead have filed class actions under federal and state securities laws against investment banks and securitization sponsors.Although we face some indemnity risks from these litigations, we have not established reserves with respect to these indemnity risks because we do not consider them to be both probable and reasonably estimable liabilities.
The aggregate reserves for all three subsidiaries were $816 million as of December 31, 2010 as compared with $238 million as of December 31, 2009.We recorded a total provision for repurchase losses for our representation and warranty repurchase exposure of $636 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.During 2010, we had settlements of repurchase requests totaling $58 million that were charged against the reserve.Table 26 summarizes changes in our representation and warranty reserves for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.

(2) The portion of the provision for mortgage repurchase claims recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of non-interest income totaled $204 million and $19 million, twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. The portion of the provision for mortgage repurchase claims recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of discontinued operations totaled $432 million and $162 million, pre-tax, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
(3) Includes increases to the representation and warranty reserves in the first and second quarter of 2010 due primarily to counterparty activity and our ability to extend the timeframe over which we estimate our repurchase liability in most cases to the full life of the mortgage loans sold by our subsidiaries for groups of loans for which we believe repurchases are probable. More specifically, of the $636 million increase in representation and warranty reserves for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, approximately $407 million resulted from our extension of repurchase liability estimates to the life of the loan effective in the second quarter of 2010.The remaining $229 million reserve accrual related primarily to changing counterparty activity in the form of updated estimates around active and probable litigation, most of which occurred in the first quarter of 2010.
As indicated in Table 27, almost all of the reserves relate to the $11 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans sold directly to the GSEs and to the $13 billion in mortgage loans sold to purchasers who placed them into Active Insured Securitizations.
67 Table of Contents Table 27:Allocation of Representation and Warranty Reserves December 31, 2010 (Dollars in millions, except for loans sold) Loans Sold 2005 to 2008 (1) Reserve Liability GSEs and Active Insured Securitizations $ 24 $ 796 Inactive Insured Securitizations and others 87 20 Total $ 111 $ 816 ______________ (1) Reflects, in billions, the total original principal balance of mortgage loans originated byour subsidiariesand sold to third party investors between 2005 and 2008.
The adequacy of the reserves and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by our subsidiaries will depend on, among other things, actual future mortgage loan performance, the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests (including the extent, if any, to which Inactive Insured Securitizations and other currently inactive investors ultimately assert claims), the actual success rates of claimants, developments in litigation, actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices).
As part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the potential future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not arise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes that would justify an incremental reserve accrual under applicable accounting standards.We believe that the upper end of thereasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond the current accrual levels, including reasonably possible future losses relating to the US Bank Litigation and DBSP Litigation , could be as high as$1.1 billion.Notwithstanding our attempt to estimate a reasonably possibleamount of loss beyond our current accrual levels based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and theamount of reasonably possible losses estimated here.There is still significant uncertainty as to numerous factors that contribute to ultimate liability levels, including, but not limited to, litigation outcomes, future repurchase claims levels, ultimate repurchase success rates, and mortgage loan performance levels.

RISK MANAGEMENT Our business activities expose us to eight major categories of risks: liquidity risk, credit risk, reputational risk, market risk, strategic risk, operational risk, compliance risk and legal risk. Our risk management framework is intended to identify, assess and mitigate risks that affect or have the potential to affect our business in order to target financial returns commensurate with our risk appetite and to avoid excessive risk-taking. We follow four key risk management principles:  Individual businesses take and manage risk in pursuit of strategic, financial and other business objectives.
Independent risk management organizations support individual businesses by providing risk management tools and policies and by aggregating risks; in some cases, risks are managed centrally.
The Board of Directors and senior management review our aggregate risk position, establish the risk appetite and work with management to ensure conformance to policy and adherence to our adopted mitigation strategy.
We employ a top risk identification system to maintain the appropriate focus on the risks and issues that may have the most impact and to identify emerging risks of consequence.
Our approach is reflected in four critical risk management practices of particular importance in the financial services industry due to changing regulatory environments and ongoing economic uncertainty.
First, we seek to mitigateliquidity riskstrategically and tactically. From a strategic perspective, we have acquired and built deposit gathering businesses and significantly reduced our loan to deposit ratio. From a tactical perspective, we have accumulated a very large liquidity reserve comprising cash, high-quality, unencumbered securities, and committed collateralized credit lines and conduit facilities.
68 Table of Contents Second, we recognize that we are exposed to cyclical changes in credit quality. Consequently, we try to ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns. Our most important tool is sound underwriting, using what we deem to be conservative assumptions. In unsecured consumer loan underwriting, we generally assume that loans will be subject to an environment in which losses are significantly higher than those prevailing at the time of underwriting. In commercial underwriting, we insist on strong cash flow, strong collateral, and strong covenants and guarantees. In addition tosound underwriting, we aggressively monitor our portfolio and aggressively collect or work out distressed loans.
Third, we recognize that reputational risk is of particular concern for financial institutions as a result of the aftermath of the recent financial crisis and economic downturn, which has resulted in increased regulation and widespread regulatory changes.Consequently, our Chief Executive Officer and executive team manage both tactical and strategic reputation issues and build our relationships with the government, media, and other constituencies to help strengthen the reputations of both our company and industry.Our actions include taking public positions in support of better consumer practices in our industry and, where possible, unilaterally implementing those practices in our business.
Finally, we recognize that maintaining a strong capital position is essential to our business strategy and competitive position.While capital is not a risk unto itself, understanding and managing risks to our capital position is an underlying objective of all our risk programs.Stress testing and economic capital measurement, both of which incorporate inputs from across the risk spectrum, are key tools for evaluating our capital position and risk adjusted returns.We also consider risks to our reputation and to our ability to access capital markets as part of our process for evaluating our capital plans.See MD&ALiquidity and Capital Management for additional information on our capital adequacy and strength.
Risk Management Roles and Responsibilities The Board of Directors is responsible for establishing our overall risk framework; approving and overseeing execution of the Enterprise Risk Management Policy and key risk category policies; establishing our risk appetite; and regularly reviewing our risk profile.
The Chief Risk Officer, who reports to the CEO, is responsible for overseeing our risk management program and driving appropriate action to resolve any weaknesses. The risk management program begins with a set of policies and risk appetites approved by the Board that are implemented through a system of risk committees and senior executive risk stewards. We have established risk committees at both the corporate and divisional level to identify and manage risk. In addition, we have assigned a senior executive expert to each of eight risk categories (the risk stewards). These executive risk stewards work with the Chief Risk Officer and the risk committees to ensure that risks are identified and given appropriate priority and attention. The Chief Risk Officer aggregates the results of these processes to assemble a view of our risk profile. Both management and the Board regularly review the risk profile.
Risk Management and Control Framework We use a consistent framework to manage risk. The framework applies at all levels, from the development of the Enterprise Risk Management Program itself to the tactical operations of the front-line business team. The framework has six key elements:  Objective Setting;  Risk Assessment;  Control Activities;  Communication and Information;  Program Monitoring; and  Organization and Culture.
Objective Setting is at the beginning of our risk management approach. We set strategic, financial, operational, and other objectives during our strategic and annual planning processes and throughout the year. These objectives cascade through the organization to individual teams of associates. The risk management approach helps identify and manage risks that have the potential to interfere with the achievement of our stated objectives.
Risk Assessment is the process of identifying risks to our objectives, evaluating the impact of those risks and choosing and executing on a response. Responses include avoidance, mitigation, or acceptance. Generally, risk responses are guided by our established risk appetite. For certain risk categories, risk assessment is largely conducted by central risk groups or jointly between business areas and central groups (market, liquidity, legal, credit, compliance). In other risk categories, risk assessment is primarily the responsibility of business areas with more limited central support (strategic, operational, reputation).
Control Activities are the day-to-day backbone of risk management. Controls provide reasonable assurance that legal, regulatory, and business requirements are being met, and identified risks are being mitigated, avoided, or accepted according to our risk response choices and risk appetite. We have practices in place designed to ensure key controls are established, evaluated, and effective in preventing a breakdown. Control activities include the monitoring of adherence to current policy and procedure requirements, sign-offs, and regular reporting to management. . They also include the resolution of regulatory and audit findings and issues and the procedures that trigger objective setting and risk assessments when new business opportunities are evaluated or business hierarchy changes occur.
69 Table of Contents Communication and Information infrastructures must be solid and are necessary to support the objective setting, risk assessment, and control activities described above. Specific reports and communication infrastructure are defined within our individual risk category policies.Our risk governance structure is designed to support solid and ongoing communication.Robust risk management requires well-functioning communication channels to inform associates of their responsibilities, alert them to issues or changes that might affect their activities, and to enable an open flow of information up, down, and across our company. Robust risk management also requires management information to enable controls to work effectively and to support the analysis needed to set objectives and assess risk accurately.
Program Monitoring is critical to our risk management program overall.Program monitoring assesses the accuracy, sufficiency, and effectiveness of current objectives, risk assessments, controls, ownership, communication, and management support. The assessment of a risk program or activity can be qualitative or quantitative.We encourage the use of measurement and metrics, where it is possible and recognizing that some risks or programs cannot be measured quantitatively.Where deficiencies are discovered, we seek to update the risk management program to resolve the deficiencies in a timely manner. Significant deficiencies are escalated to the appropriate risk executive or risk committee.Clear accountability is defined when resolving deficiencies to ensure the desired outcome is achieved. Risk management programs are monitored at every level; from the overall Enterprise Risk Management Program to the individual risk management activities in each business area.
Organization and Culture is intended to create and maintain an effective risk management organization and culture.A strong organization and culture promotes risk management as a key factor in making important business decisions and helps drive risk management activities deeper into the company.An effective risk management culture starts with a well-defined risk management philosophy. It requires established risk management objectives that align to business objectives and make targeted risk management activities part of ongoing business management activities.We believe we staff risk functions at the appropriate levels with qualified associates and effective tools that support risk management practices and activities.Senior management and the Board of Directors are ultimately accountable for promoting adherence to sound risk principles and tolerances.We seek to incent associates at all levels to perform according to corporate policies and risk tolerance and in conformity with applicable laws and regulations.Additionally, management tries to ensure that performance goals, plans, and incentives are designed to promote financial performance within the confines of a sound risk management program and within defined risk tolerances.
We have a corporate Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the Code) (available on the Corporate Governance page of our website at www.capitalone.com/about) under which each associate is obligated to behave with integrity in dealing with customers and business partners and to comply with applicable laws and regulations. We disclose any waivers to the Code on our website. We also have an associate performance management process that emphasizes achieving business results while ensuring integrity, compliance, and sound business management.
Risk Appetite We have a defined risk appetite for each of our eight risk categories that is approved by the Board of Directors.Each risk category has its own risk appetite statement.Stated risk appetites, and the assessment framework that support them, define the guardrails for taking and accepting risks and are used by senior management and the Board to make business decisions.
The risk appetite framework assesses each risk category across three dimensions, using consistent, comprehensive, and understandable measures.The three dimensions are:  Net Risk:Assessment of the level of risk given internal and external factors  Quality of Governance and Controls:Evidence demonstrating the strength (or weakness) of our risk governance structure and/or controls associated with the risk category and our ability to address issues  Mitigation Plan Status:When needed, the status of our key mitigation activity needed to reduce risk All three framework dimensions are assessed and measured using a five-point scale.The assessment language in each scale is customized by each risk steward to reflect the tolerance levels of each of the eight risk categories.
70 Table of Contents Risk Categories Our risk management program is organized around eight risk categories. They are: Liquidity Risk: is the risk that future financial obligations are not met or future asset growth cannot occur because of an inability to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time. The Chief Financial Officer is the accountable executive for liquidity risk. Liquidity strength is assessed by evaluating several different balance sheet metrics under severe stress scenarios to ensure we can withstand significant funding degradation in both deposits and capital marketing funding sources.Management reports liquidity metrics to the Finance and Trust Oversight Committee of the Board no less than quarterly and to Asset/Liability Management Committee on a monthly basis.Breaches in liquidity metric limits are reported to the Treasurer as soon as they are identified and to the Asset/Liability Management Committee at the next regularly scheduled committee meeting, unless the breach activates the Liquidity Contingency Plan. Breaches are also reported to the Finance and Trust Oversight Committee no later than the next regularly scheduled meeting. Detailed processes, requirements and controls are contained in our policies and supporting procedures.
Credit Risk: is the risk of loss from a borrowers failure to meet the terms of any contract or failure to otherwise perform as agreed. There are four primary sources of credit risk: (1)changing economic conditions, which affect borrowers ability to pay and the value of any collateral; (2)a changing competitive environment, which affects customer debt loads, borrowing patterns and loan terms; (3)our underwriting strategies and standards, which determine to whom we offer credit and on what terms; and (4)the quality of our internal controls, which establish a process to test that underwriting conforms to our standards and identifies credit quality issues so we can act upon them in a timely manner. The Chief Risk Officer is the accountable executive for credit risk.
We have quantitative credit risk guidelines for each of our lines of business. We conduct portfolio and decision level monitoring and stress tests using economic and legislative stress scenarios. Credit risk objectives are achieved by establishing a credit governance framework and by establishing policies, procedures, and controls for each step in the credit process. The Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Consumer and Commercial Credit Officers, and Division Presidents have specific accountable roles in the management of credit risk. These include policy approval, creation of credit strategy, review of credit position, delegation of authority, and appointments and responsibilities of key executives and Credit Policy Committee members. Our evolving credit risk position and recommendations to address issues are reviewed by managements Credit Policy Committee and the Board of Directors.
Reputation Risk: is the risk to market value, recruitment, and retention of talented associates and a loyal customer base due to the negative perceptions of our internal and external stakeholders regarding our business strategies and activities. Our General Counsel is the accountable executive for reputation risk.
Reputation risk associated with daily interactions are managed by our business areas.Business area activities are controlled by the frameworks set forth in the Reputation Risk Policy and other risk management policies.Each business area determines how much risk it is willing to accept and when it is prudent to execute mitigation activities.The Reputation Risk Management Policy sets forth the obligation of each business area, with direction and guidance from the Reputation Risk Steward and his or her designee to identify, assess and determine whether and how best to mitigate its reputation risk.The Reputation Risk Steward is responsible for reporting on the assessments of our aggregate reputation risk, as well as the state of our reputation with specific stakeholder groups, to the Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Executive Officer, and the Risk Management Committee as appropriate.
Market Risk: is the risk that earnings or the economic value of equity will under-perform due to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates (market rates), or other financial market asset prices. Our ability to manage market risks contributes to our overall capital management. The Chief Financial Officer is the accountable executive for market risk.
The market risk positions of our banking entities and the company are calculated separately and in total and are reported versus pre-established limits to the Asset/Liability Management Committee and the Finance and Trust Oversight Committee of the Board no less than quarterly. Management is authorized to utilize financial instruments as outlined in our policy to actively manage market risk exposure. Detailed processes, requirements and controls are contained in our policies and supporting procedures.
71 Table of Contents Strategic Risk: is the risk that we fail to achieve short and long-term business objectives because we fail to develop the products, capabilities, and competitive position necessary to attract consumers, succeed against competitors and withstand market volatility. The result is a failure to deliver returns expected by stakeholders (customers, associates, stockholders, investors, communities, and regulators). The Chief Executive Officer is the accountable executive for our strategy.
The Chief Executive Officer develops an overall corporate strategy and leads alignment of the entire organization with this strategy through definition of strategic imperatives and top-down communication. The Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives spend significant time throughout the entire company sharing our strategic imperatives to promote an understanding of our strategy and connect it to day-to-day associate activities to enable effective execution. Division Presidents are accountable for defining business strategy within the context of the overall corporate level strategy and Strategic Imperatives. Business strategies are integrated into the Corporate Strategic Plan and are reviewed and approved separately and together on an annual basis by the Chief Executive Officer and the Board of Directors.
Operational Risk: is the risk of loss, adverse customer experience, or negative regulatory or reputation impact resulting from failed or inadequate processes, associate capabilities or systems, or exposure to external events. The Chief Compliance Officer is the accountable executive for establishment of risk management standards and for governance and monitoring of operational risk at a corporate level. Division Presidents have primary accountability for management of operational risk within their business areas.
While most operational risks are managed and controlled by business areas, the Operational Risk Management Program establishes requirements and control processes that assure certain consistent practices in the management of operational risk, and provides transparency to the corporate operational risk profile. Our Operational Risk Management Program also includes two primary additional functions. Operational Risk Reporting involves independent assessments of the control and sustainability of key business processes at a corporate and business area level, and such assessments are provided to the Chief Risk Officer, managements Risk Management Committee, and the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board. The Operational Risk Capital function, in conjunction with the corporate capital process managed by Global Finance, establishes necessary operational risk capital levels to assure resiliency against extreme operational risk event scenarios.
Operational Risk results and trends are reported to the Risk Management Committee and the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board.
Compliance Risk: is the risk of financial loss due to regulatory fines or penalties, restriction or suspension of business, or cost of mandatory corrective action as a result of failing to adhere to applicable laws, regulations, principles and supervisory guidance as well as our own internal standards intended to adhere to these laws and regulations. Division Presidents are the accountable executives for compliance risk and are responsible for building and maintaining compliance processes. With the Chief Compliance Officer, Division Presidents are jointly accountable for ensuring the Compliance Management Program requirements are met for their division.
We ensure compliance by maintaining an effective Compliance Management Program consisting of sound policies, systems, processes, and reports. The Compliance Management Program provides management with guidance, training, and monitoring to provide reasonable assurance of our compliance with internal and external compliance requirements. Additionally, management and the Corporate Compliance department jointly and separately conduct on-going monitoring and assess the state of compliance. The assessment provides the basis for performance reporting to management and the Board, allows business areas to determine if their compliance performance is acceptable, and confirms effective compliance controls are in place. Business areas embed compliance requirements and controls into their business policies, standards, processes and procedures. They regularly monitor and report on the efficiency of their compliance controls. Corporate Compliance, jointly working with the business, defines and validates a standard compliance monitoring and reporting methodology. Compliance results and trends are reported to managements Risk Management Committee and the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board.
Legal Risk: is the risk of material adverse impact due to: (i)new and changed laws and regulations; (ii)new interpretations of law; (iii)the drafting, interpretation and enforceability of contracts; (iv)adverse decisions or consequences arising from litigation or regulatory scrutiny; (v)the establishment, management and governance of our legal entity structure; and (vi)the failure to seek or follow appropriate legal counsel when needed. Our General Counsel is the accountable executive for monitoring and controlling legal risk.
Our Legal Department serves as our control against legal risk by providing legal evaluation and guidance to the enterprise and business areas.This evaluation and guidance is based on the assessment of legal counsel of the type and degree of legal risk associated with the internal business area practices and activities and of the controls the business has in place to mitigate legal risks.Legal risk is governed by and defined in our Legal Risk Policy.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT Liquidity We have established liquidity guidelines that are intended to ensure that we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to withstand the potential impact of deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in the funding markets. Our guidelines include maintaining an adequate liquidity reserve to cover our potential funding requirements and diversified funding sources to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. Our liquidity reserves consist of cash and cash equivalents, unencumbered available-for-sale securities and undrawn committed securitization borrowing facilities. Table 28 below presents the composition of our liquidity reserves as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Our liquidity reserves decreased by $1.5 billion during 2010 to $37.0 billion as of December 31, 2010.
Table 28: Liquidity Reserves December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 5,249 $ 8,685 Securities available for sale (1) 41,537 38,830 Less: Pledged available for sale securities (9,963 ) (11,883 ) Unencumbered available-for-sale securities 31,574 26,947 Undrawn committed securitization borrowing facilities 207 2,913 Total liquidity reserves $ 37,030 $ 38,545 ____________ (1) The weighted average life of our available-for-sale securities was approximately 5.1 and 4.9 years as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Funding Our funding objective is to establish an appropriate maturity profile using a cost-effective mix of both short-term and long-term funds. We use a variety of funding sources, including deposits, loan securitizations, debt and equity securities, securitization borrowing facilities and FHLB advances.
72 Table of Contents Deposits Our deposits provide a stable and relatively low cost of funds and have become our largest source of funding. We have expanded our opportunities for deposit growth through direct and indirect marketing channels, our existing branch network and branch expansion. These channels offer a broad set of deposit products that include demand deposits, money market deposits, negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit. Table 29 presents the composition of our deposits by type as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.Total deposits increased by $6.4 billion, or 5.5%, in 2010, to $122.2 billion as of December 31, 2010.
Table 29: Deposits December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Non-interest bearing $ 15,048 $ 13,439 NOW accounts 13,536 12,077 Money market deposit accounts 44,485 38,094 Savings accounts 26,077 17,019 Other consumer time deposits 15,753 25,456 Total core deposits 114,899 106,085 Public fund certificates of deposit $100,000 or more 177 579 Certificates of deposit $100,000 or more 6,300 8,248 Foreign time deposits 834 897 Total deposits $ 122,210 $ 115,809 Of our total deposits, approximately $834 million and $897 million were held in foreign banking offices as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Large domestic denomination certificates of deposits of $100,000 or more represented $6.5 billion and $8.8 billion of our total deposits as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our funding and liquidity strategy takes into consideration the scheduled maturities of large denomination time deposits. Of the $6.5 billion in large domestic denomination certificates of deposit as of December 31, 2010, $0.7 billion is scheduled to mature within the next three months; $2.3 billion is scheduled to mature between three and 12 months and $3.5 billion is scheduled to mature over 12 months. Based on past activity, we expect to retain a portion of these deposits as they mature.
We have brokered deposits, which we obtained through the use of third-party intermediaries that are included above in Table 28 in money market deposit accounts and other consumer time deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 limits the use of brokered deposits to well-capitalized insured depository institutions and, with a waiver from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to adequately capitalized institutions. COBNA and CONA were well-capitalized, as defined under the federal banking regulatory guidelines, as of December 31, 2010, and therefore permitted to maintain brokered deposits. Our brokered deposits totaled $14.8 billion, or 12% of total deposits, as of December 31, 2010. Brokered deposits totaled $18.8 billion, or 16% of total deposits, as of December 31, 2009. Based on our historical access to the brokered deposit market, we expect to replace maturing brokered deposits with new brokered deposits or direct deposits and branch deposits.
Table 30 provides a summary of the future maturities of large denomination time deposits. Our funding and liquidity planning factors in the maturities of these deposits. Based on past activity, we expect to retain a portion of these deposits as they mature. Therefore, the expected net cash outflow will be less than reported in the summary table.

These borrowings are generally in the form of federal funds purchased and resale agreements, most of which are overnight borrowings. Other short term borrowings are not a significant portion of our overall funding.Table 32 provides summary information about the amounts borrowed and rates paid on other short term borrowings.
Table 32: Short Term Borrowings (Dollars in millions) Maximum Outstanding as of any Month-End Outstanding as of Year-End Average Outstanding Average Interest Rate Year-End Weighted Average Interest Rate 2010: Federal funds purchased and resale agreements $ 2,469 $ 1,517 $ 1,731 0.23 % 0.13 % 2009: Federal funds purchased and resale agreements $ 3,778 $ 1,140 $ 2,958 0.25 % 0.11 % 74 Table of Contents Other Funding Sources We also access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through loan securitization transactions and the issuance of senior and subordinated debt.In addition, we utilize advances from the FHLB that are secured by our investment securities, residential home loan portfolio, multifamily loans, commercial real-estate loans and home equity lines of credit for our funding needs.
We have committed loan securitization conduit lines of $1.3 billion, of which $1.1 billion was outstanding as of December 31, 2010. Senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings, including FHLB advances, totaled $14.9 billion as of December 31, 2010, down from $17.1 billion as of December 31, 2009.The $2.1 billion decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in FHLB advances.Our FHLB membership is secured by our investment in FHLB stock, which totaled $269 million as of December 31, 2010.We did not issue any senior or subordinated debt during 2010.
Borrowing Capacity As of December 31, 2010, we had an effective shelf registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) under which, from time to time, we may offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depository shares representing preferred stock, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants, units, trust preferred securities, junior subordinated debt securities, guarantees of trust preferred securities and certain back-up obligations. There is no limit under this shelf registration statement to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell. Under SEC rules, the shelf registration statement, which we filed in May 2009, expires three years after filing. We did not issue anysecurities under the shelf registration statement in 2010.
In addition to issuance capacity under the shelf registration statement, we have access to other borrowing programs. Table 33 summarizes our borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2010.

Funding availability under all other sources is subject to market conditions. Capacity is the maximum amount that can be borrowed. Availability is the amount that can still be borrowed against the facility.
(2) Maturity date refers to the date the facility terminates, where applicable.
(3) The ability to draw down funding is based on membership status, and the amount is dependent upon the Banks ability to post collateral.
(4) Committed securitization conduits capacity is set at various dates in conjunction with each arrangement, with the last termination scheduled for November 2011.
Contractual Obligations In the normal course of business, we into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments that affect our short- and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs.Commitments for future cash expenditures primarily relate to deposits, debt securities and other borrowings and operating leases.Table 34 provides aggregated information about the listed categories of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010. The table includes information about undiscounted future cash payments due under these contractual obligations, including the contractual maturity profile of deposits, debt securities and other borrowings reported on our consolidated balance sheet and our operating leases at December 31, 2010. The timing of actual future payments may differ from those presented due to a number of factors, including discretionary debt repurchases.
The table excludes certain obligations such as trade payables and trading liabilities, where the obligation is short-term or subject to valuation based on market factors. The table also excludes the representation and warranty reserve of $816 million.

(2) Other borrowings includes secured borrowings for our on-balance sheet auto loan securitizations, junior subordinated capital securities and debentures, FHLB advances, federal funds purchased and resale agreements and other short-term borrowings.
Covenants In connection with the issuance of certain of our trust preferred securities, we entered into Replacement Capital Covenants (RCCs) granting certain rights to the holders of covered debt which was defined in the RCCs as our 5.35% Subordinated Notes due May 1, 2014.The RCCs prohibited the repayment, redemption or purchase of the trust preferred securities except, with limited exceptions, to the extent that we received specified amounts of proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying securities. We commenced a solicitation of consents from the covered debtholders on November29, 2010, to terminate the RCCs.The RCCs were terminated on December 10, 2010, the expiration date of the consent solicitation, at which time we had received the consent of holders of a majority of the principal amount of the covered debt.
The terms of certain lease and credit facility agreements related to other borrowings and operating leasesinclude several financial covenantsthat requireperformance measures and equity ratios to be met. If these covenants are not met, there may be an acceleration of the payment due dates noted in Table 32. As of December31, 2010, we were not in default of any such covenants.
Capital The level and composition of our equity capital are determined by multiple factors including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and an internal risk-based capital assessment, and may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments.
Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action Bank holding companies and national banks are subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively.The capital adequacy standards set forth minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements that are based on quantitative and qualitative measures of their assets and off-balance sheet items.Under the capital adequacy standards, bank holding companies and banks currently are required to maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4%, and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 4% (3% for banks that meet certain specified criteria, including excellent asset quality, high liquidity, low interest rate exposure and the highest regulatory rating).
Under prompt corrective action capital regulations, a bank is considered to be well capitalized if it maintains a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% (200 basis points higher than the above minimum capital standard), a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6%, a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 5% and not be subject to any supervisory agreement, order, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital reserve. A bank is considered to be adequately capitalized if it meets the above minimum capital ratios and does not otherwise meet the well capitalized definition.Currently, prompt corrective action capital requirements do not apply to bank holding companies.
In addition to disclosing our regulatory capital ratios, we also discloseTier 1 common equity and TCE ratios, which are non-GAAP measures widely used by investors, analysts, rating agencies and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies. There is currently no mandated minimum or well capitalized standard for Tier 1 common equity; instead the risk-based capital rules state voting common stockholders equity should be the dominant element within Tier 1 common equity.Management reviews our Tier 1 common equity and TCE ratios, along with other measures of capital, as part of its financial analyses anddiscloses these non-GAAP capital measures because of current interest in such information on the part of market participants.Please see "Financial Highlights" under "Executive Summary and Business Outlook" for more information on our TCE ratio. Table 35 provides the details of the calculation of our capital ratios, including a reconciliation of the total stockholders equity reported in our consolidated balance sheets to Tier 1 common equity.

(2) Consists primarily of trust preferred securities.
(3) Under regulatory guidelines for risk-based capital, on-balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total risk-weighted assets.
Table 36 provides a comparison of our capital ratios under the Federal Reserves capital adequacy standards; and the capital ratios of the Banks under the OCCs capital adequacy standards as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. As of December 31, 2010, we exceeded minimum capital requirements and would meet the well-capitalized ratio levels specified under prompt corrective action for total risk-based capital and Tier 1 risk-based capital under Federal Reserve capital standards for bank holding companies. As of December 31, 2010, the Banks also exceeded minimum regulatory requirements under the OCCs applicable capital adequacy guidelines and were well-capitalized under prompt corrective action requirements.

Accordingly, we no longer disclose these ratios.
(2) The regulatory framework for prompt corrective action does not apply to Capital One Financial Corp. because it is a bank holding company.
(3) Tier 1 common equity ratio is a non-GAAP measure calculated based on Tier 1 common equity divided by risk-weighted assets.
(4) Calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets.
(5) Calculated based on Total risk-based capital divided by risk-weighted assets.
(6) Calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets, after certain adjustments.
The January 1, 2010 adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards resulted in our consolidating a substantial portion of our securitization trusts and establishing an allowance for loan and lease losses for the assets underlying these trusts, which reduced retained earnings and our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio. In January 2010, banking regulators issued regulatory capital rules related to the impact of the new consolidation accounting standards. Under these rules, we are required to hold additional capital for the assets we consolidated. The capital rules also provided for an optional phase-in of the impact from the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards, including a two-quarter implementation delay followed by a two-quarter partial implementation of the effect on regulatory capital ratios.
We elected the phase-in option, which required us to phase-in 50% of consolidated assets beginning with the third quarter of 2010 for purposes of determining risk-weighted assets.However, the phase-in impact was effectively accelerated over the first three quarters of 2010 due to pay downs of outstanding securitization debt. The phase-in provisions expired after December 31, 2010, and the full impact of the consolidated assets on capital ratios will be realized in the first quarter of 2011.
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, many trust preferred securities will cease to qualify for Tier 1 capital, subject to a three year phase-out period expected to begin in 2013. See Supervision and Regulation for more information.
Dividend Policy The declaration and payment of dividends to our stockholders, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of the our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. As a bank holding company, our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries.
For additional information on dividends, See Item 1. Business  Supervision and Regulation  Dividends, Stock Purchases and Transfer of Funds.
Regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the Banks to transfer funds to us.As of December 31, 2010, funds available for dividend payments from the Banks were $1.4 billion and zero, respectively.Funds available for dividend payments from the Banks in the third quarter of 2010 were $803 million and zero, respectively. Although funds are available for dividend payments from COBNA, we would execute a dividend from COBNA in consultation with the OCC.Additionally, a dividend payment by CONA would require prior approval of the OCC.Applicable provisions that may be contained in our borrowing agreements or the borrowing agreements of our subsidiaries may limit our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to us or our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends.
78 Table of Contents In the fourth quarter of 2010, we participated in a Federal Reserve led Capital Plan Review and stress test along with 19 other top U.S. banks.We will incorporate any feedback from our regulators in response to the Capital Plan Review in our ongoing capital management actions.
MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk generally represents the risk that our earnings and/or economic value of equity may be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities, including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. Market conditions that may change from time to time, thereby exposing us to market risk, include changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, credit spreads and price fluctuation or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of issuers.
Our most significant market risks include our exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk.
We have prescribed risk management policies and limits established by our Asset/Liability Management Committee. Our objective is to manage our asset/liability risk position and exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and prescribed limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. Because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analyses to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings and the economic value of equity.
Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk, which represents exposure to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates, is our most significant market risk exposure. Banks are inevitably exposed to interest rate risk due to d ifferences in the timing between the maturity or repricing of assets and liabilities.
For example, if more assets are repricing than deposits and other borrowings when general interest rates are declining, our earnings will decrease initially.Similarly, if more deposits and other borrowings are repricing than assets when general interest rates are rising, our earnings will decrease initially.
Interest rate risk also results from changes in customer behavior and competitors responses to changes in interest rates or other market conditions.For example, decreases in mortgage interest rates generally results in faster than expected prepayments, which may adversely affect earnings.Increases in interest rates, coupled with strong demand from competitors for deposits, may influence industry pricing.Such competition may affect customer decisions to maintain balances in the deposit accounts, which may require replacing lower cost deposits with higher cost alternative sources of funding.
We employ several strategies to manage our interest rate risk, which include, but are not limited to, changing the maturity and re-pricing characteristics of our various assets and liabilities and using interest rate derivatives.We consider the impact on both earnings and economic value of equity in measuring and managing our interest rate risk.
Our earnings sensitivity measure estimates the impact on net interest income and the valuation of our mortgage servicing rights (net of derivatives) as a result of movements in interest rates.Our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net preset value of our assets and liabilities, including derivatives, as a result of movements in interest rates.Our earnings sensitivity and economic value of equity measurements are based on our existing assets and liabilities, including our derivatives, and do not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected plans for funding mix changes. However, we also assess the potential impact of growth assumptions, changing business activities, alternative interest rate scenarios and changing market environments, which we factor into our interest rate risk management decisions.
Under our current asset/liability management policy, we seek to limit the potential decrease in our projected net interest income resulting from a gradual plus or minus 200 basis point change in forward rates to less than 5% over the next 12 months. Our current asset/liability management policy also includes limiting the adverse change in the economic value of our equity due to an instantaneous parallel interest rate shock to spot rates of plus or minus 200 basis points to less than 12%. The federal funds rate remained at a target range of zero to 0.25% throughout 2010. Given the level of short-term rates as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, a scenario where interest rates would decline by 200 basis points is not plausible.We therefore revised our customary declining interest rate scenario of 200 basis points to a 50 basis point decrease.
Table 37 compares the estimated impact on net interest income and the economic value of equity of our selected hypothetical interest rate scenarios as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. All changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and economic value of our equity at the base interest rate scenario.Our earnings and economic value sensitivity measures were low and within our prescribed asset/liability policy limits as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.
79 Table of Contents Table 37: Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis December 31, 2010 2009 Impact to projected base-line net interest income: + 200 basis points (1) (0.7 )% (0.4 )% - 50 basis points (1) (0.2 ) (0.1 ) Impact to economic value of equity: + 200 basis points (2) (3.8 )% (3.2 )% - 50 basis points (2) 0.1 0.3 _______________ (1) These sensitivities include our net interest income and mortgage servicing rights valuation change (net of hedges).For net interest income, the rate scenarios are based on a hypothetical gradual increase in interest rates of 200 basis points and a hypothetical gradual decrease of 50 basis points to forward rates over the next 9 months. For the mortgage servicing rights valuation change (net of hedges), the rate scenarios are based on a hypothetical instantaneous parallel rate shock of plus 200 basis points and minus 50 basis points to spot rates.
(2) Based on a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of plus 200 basis points and minus 50 basis points to spot rates.
The interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information,internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and deposit behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments.Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities.
There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The above sensitivity analyses contemplate only certain movements in interest rates and are performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet, and do not incorporate other factors that may have a significant effect, most notably future business activities and strategic actions that management may take to manage interest rate risk. Actual earnings and economic value of equity could differ from the above sensitivity analyses.
Foreign Exchange Risk We are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates, which may impact the earnings of our foreign operations. Our asset/liability management policy requires that we use derivatives to hedge material foreign currency denominated transactions to limit our earnings exposure to foreign exchange risk.The estimated reduction in our 12-month earnings due to adverse foreign exchange rate movements corresponding to a 95% probability was less than 2% as of December31, 2010 and 2009.The precision of this estimate is limited due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying forecast assumptions.
Derivative Instruments Derivatives are one of the primary tools we use in managing interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We execute our derivative contracts in both over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivative markets.Although the majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps, we also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk.The outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts totaled $50.8 billion as of December 31, 2010, compared with $59.2 billion as of December 31, 2009.See Note 11Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for additional information on our derivatives activity.

96 Table of Contents CA PITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company Capital One Financial Corporation, which was established in 1995, is a diversified financial services holding company headquartered in McLean, Virginia.Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through branches, the internet and other distribution channels. Our principal subsidiaries include Capital One Bank (USA), National Association (COBNA) and Capital One, National Association (CONA).The Company and its subsidiaries are hereafter collectively referred to as we, us or our.CONA and COBNA are hereafter collectively referred to as the Banks. As one of the top 10 largest banks in the United States based on deposits, we serve banking customers through branch locations primarily in New York, New Jersey, Texas, Louisiana, Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia.In addition to bank lending and depository services, we offer credit and debit card products, mortgage banking and treasury management services. We offer our products outside of the United States principally through operations in the United Kingdom and Canada.
Our principal operations are currently organized into three primary business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served:Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking.
Credit Card: Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending, domestic small business lending, national closed end installment lending and the international card lending businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom.
Consumer Banking: Consists of our branch-based lending and deposit gathering activities for consumer and small businesses, national deposit gathering, national automobile lending and consumer home loan lending and servicing activities.
Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending, deposit gathering and treasury management services to commercial real estate and middle market customers.
Certain activities that are not part of a segment are included in the Other category.The results of our individual businesses are prepared based on our internal management accounting system and reflect the manner in which management measures and evaluates performance.The accounting policies with respect to activities specifically attributable to each business segment are generally the same as those used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.However, the preparation of business line results requires management to allocate funding costs and benefits, expenses and other financial elements to each line of business.F or details of our business segment accounting policies, allocation methodologies and business segment results, see Note 20Business Segments.
Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements.While management makes its best judgment, actual amounts or results could differ from these estimates.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Capital One Financial Corporation and all other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest.All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity (VIE).
97 Table of Contents Voting Interest Entities Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that give them the power to make significant decisions relating to the entitys operations.The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest.Accordingly, we consolidate our majority-owned subsidiaries and other voting interest entities in which we hold, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or where we exercise control through other contractual rights.
Investments in entities where we do not have a controlling financial interest but we have significant influence over the entitys financial and operating decisions (generally defined as owning a voting interest of 20% to 50%) are accounted for under the equity method.
If we own less than 20% of a voting interest entity, we generally carry the investment at cost, except marketable equity securities, which we carry at fair value with changes in fair value included in accumulated other comprehensive income.We typically report investments accounted for under the equity or cost method in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, and include our share of income or loss in other non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income.
Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) VIEs are entities that lack one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity.Either the entity does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest.
The entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE.
Prior to January1, 2010, the primary beneficiary was the entity that would absorb a majority of the economic risks and rewards of the VIE based on an analysis of projected probability-weighted cash flows.
On January 1, 2010, we implemented new consolidation accounting guidance that amended several key consolidation provisions related to VIEs. The new guidance eliminated the concept of qualified special purpose entities (QSPEs), which were previously exempt from consolidation, and introduced a new framework for determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Under the new guidance, the primary beneficiary is the entity that has (i) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE.The new consolidation guidance also requires companies to continually reassess whether they are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, whereas the previous rules only required reconsideration upon the occurrence of certain triggering events.We discuss the impact from the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance below under Special Purpose Entities and Variable Interest Entities.
In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the nature, size and form of our involvement with the VIE, such as our role in establishing the VIE and our ongoing rights and responsibilities; our economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE; the design of the VIE, including the capitalization structure, subordination of interests, payment priority, relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIEs capital structure and the reasons why the interests are held by us.
We perform on-going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting-interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and are therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework and whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding our involvement with a VIE result in a change in ourconsolidation conclusion regarding the VIE to change. Our reassessment process considers whether we have acquired or divested the power to direct the activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. The reassessment also considers whether we have acquired or disposed of a financial interest that could be significant to the VIE, or whether an interest in the VIE has become significant or is no longer significant. The consolidation status of the VIEs with which we are involved may change as a result of such reassessments.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and resale agreements and interest-bearing deposits at other banks, all of which, if applicable, have stated maturities of three months or less when acquired. Cash payments for interest expense totaled $2.9 billion, $3.1 billion and $4.0 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $0.3 billion, $0.4 billion and $1.2 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
98 Table of Contents Resale and Repurchase Agreements Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, principally U.S. government and agency obligations, are generally not accounted for as sales but as collateralized financing transactions and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold, plus accrued interest. We receive securities purchased under agreements to resell, make delivery of securities sold under agreements to repurchase, continually monitor the market value of these securities and deliver or obtain additional collateral as appropriate.
Investment Securities Our investment securities consist primarily of fixed-income debt securities and equity securities.
We regularly evaluate our securities whose value has declined below amortized cost to assess whether the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary.Amortized cost reflects historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums, accretion of discounts and other-than-temporary impairment writedowns.
We discuss the techniques we use in determining the fair value of our investment securities in Note 19Fair Value of Financial Instruments.We discuss our assessment of and accounting for other-than-temporary impairment in Note 4Investment Securities.Unamortized premiums and discounts on our investment securities are recognized in interest income over the contractual life of the security using the interest method.Realized gains and losses from the sales of debt securities are determined on a trade date basis using the specific identification method and included in non-interest income.
Investment Securities Classification We classify securities as available for sale or held to maturity based on our investment strategy and managements assessment of our intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity.The accounting and measurement framework for our investment securities differs depending on the security classification.The classification criteria and accounting and measurement framework for our investment securities are described below.
Securities Available for Sale We classify securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time and may sell prior to maturity in response to changes in our investment strategy, liquidity needs, interest rate risk profile or for other reasons as available for sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized net gains or losses, net of taxes, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity.All of our investment securities were classified as available for sale as of December 31, 2010.
Securities Held to Maturity We classify securities that we have the intent and ability to hold until maturity as held to maturity.Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost.In connection with the acquisition of Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B. ("Chevy Chase Bank"), certain investment securities were classified as held to maturity at the date of our acquisition.We currently do not have any securities classified as held to maturity, although we may elect to do so in the future.
Loans Our loan portfolio consists of credit card, other consumer and commercial loans.Other consumer loans consist of automobile, home, and retail banking loans.Commercial loans consist of commercial and multifamily real estate, middle market, specialty lending and small-ticket commercial real estate loans.We historically have securitized credit card loans, auto loans, home loans and installment loans through trusts we established to purchase the loans; however, we did not securitize any loans during 2010.
The primary purposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy investor demand and generate liquidity.Prior to January 1, 2010, the transfers of these loans to securitization trusts were generally accounted for as sales and the sold assets were removed from our consolidated balance sheets, which resulted in favorable regulatory capital treatment.As a result of our January 1, 2010 adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards, we have consolidated these securitization trusts. The loans underlying consolidated trusts are reported on our consolidated balance sheet under restricted loans for securitization investors.
Loan Classification We classify loans as held for investment or held for sale based on our investment strategy and managements assessment of our intent and ability to hold loans for the foreseeable future or until maturity.Managements intent and ability with respect to certain loans may change from time to time depending on a number of factors, including economic, liquidity and capital conditions.The accounting and measurement framework for loans differs depending on the loan classification and whether the loans are originated or purchased. The accounting for purchased loans also differs depending on whether the loan is considered credit-impaired at the date of acquisition.The classification criteria and accounting and measurement framework for loans held for investment, loans held for sale and purchased-credit impaired loans are described below.
99 Table of Contents Loans Held for Investment Loans that we have the ability and intent to hold for the foreseeable future or to maturity and loans associated with on-balance sheet securitization transactions accounted for as secured borrowings are classified as held for investment.The substantial majority of our loans, which include unrestricted loans and restricted loans for securitization investors, are classified as held for investment.
Credit card loans classified as held for investment are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balance plus uncollected billed interest and fees net of billed interest and fees deemed uncollectible.Other loans classified as held for investment, except for purchased credit-impaired loans, are reported at amortized cost.Amortized cost is measured based on the outstanding unpaid principal amount, net of unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs and charge-offs.We generally defer certain loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs on originated loans, premiums and discounts on purchased loans and loan commitment fees and recognize these amounts in interest income as yield adjustments over the life of the loan and/or commitment period using the level yield interest method.
Interest income is recognized on loans held for investment, other than purchased credit-impaired loans, on an accrual basis. We establish an allowance for loan losses for probable losses inherent in our held for investment loan portfolio as of each balance sheet date.
Cash flows related to unrestricted loans held for investment are included in cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows regardless of a subsequent change in intent.Because our securitization transactions are accounted for under the new consolidation accounting standards as secured borrowings, the cash flows from these transactions are presented as cash flows from financing activities rather than as cash flows from operating or investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows beginning in 2010.
Loans Held for Sale Loans that we intend to sell or for which we do not have the ability and intent to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as held for sale. We historically classified c redit card loans necessary to support new securitization transactions expected to take place in the next three months as held for sale.Management limited the timeframe in which it believed it could reasonably estimate the amount of existing credit card loans to support securitization transactions to three months because of the uncertainity ofcustomer repayment behavior and the revolving nature of credit cards.
Loans classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of amortized cost or fair value as determined on an aggregate homogeneous portfolio basis, with any write-downs or recoveries in fair value up to the amortized cost recorded in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest income.We recognize interest on loans held for sale classified as performing on an accrual basis. Because loans held for sale are reported at lower of cost or fair value, an allowance for loan losses is not established for loans held for sale.
The fair value of loans held for sale is estimated based on secondary market prices for loan portfolios with similar characteristics.
In certain circumstances, we may transfer loans to/from held for sale or held for investment based on a change in strategy.We transfer these loans at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer and establish a new cost basis upon transfer.Write-downs on loans transferred from held for investment to held for sale are recorded as charge-offs at the time of transfer.
We execute whole loan sales with either servicing rights released to the buyer or retained.When loans are sold and the servicing rights are released to the buyer, the gain or loss recognized on the sale is calculated based on the difference between the proceeds received and the carrying value of the loans sold.When loans are sold and the servicing rights are retained, the fair value attributed to the retained servicing rights impacts the gain or loss recognized on the sale. We report g ains or losses on loans held for sale when realized in other non-interest income.
Loans Acquired All purchased loans, including loans transferred in a business combination, acquired on or after January 1, 2009, are initially recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected.Accordingly, any related allowance for loan losses cannot be carried over or established at acquisition. Prior to January 1, 2009, non-impaired purchased loans aquired in a business combinationwere generally recorded at the present value of amounts received, determined at appropriate current interest rates, less allowances for uncollectibility and collection costs, if necessary.
100 Table of Contents Loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at the date of acquisition that we will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments are considered purchased credit impaired (PCI) loans.Evidence of credit deterioration as of the acquisition date may include statistics such as delinquency and accrual status; current loan-to-value ratio; the geographic location of the borrower or collateral and internal risk ratings.In connection with the acquisition of Chevy Chase Bank on February 27, 2009, we concluded that the substantial majority of loans we acquired from Chevy Chase Bank were PCI.See Note 2Acquisitions and Restructuring Activities and Note 5Loans for additional information.
In determining the fair value of purchased credit-impaired loans at acquisition, we first determine the contractually required payments due, which represent the total undiscounted amount of all uncollected principal and interest payments, adjusted for the effect of estimated prepayments.We then estimate the undiscounted cash flows we expect to collect. We incorporate several key assumptions to estimate cash flows expected to be collected, including default rates, loss severities and the amount and timing of prepayments.We calculate the fair value by discounting the estimated cash flows we expect to collect using an observable market rate of interest, when available, adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider in determining fair value.Purchasers are permitted to aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools if the loans have common risk characteristics. A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate fair value and expected cash flows.
The difference between contractually required payments due and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. The nonaccretable difference, which is neither accreted into income nor recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, reflects estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan.The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value of purchased credit-impaired loans is referred to as the accretable yield. This amount is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, but is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans, using the effective yield method.
Subsequent to acquisition, we complete quarterly evaluations of expected cash flows.Decreases in expected cash flows attributable to credit will generally result in an impairment charge to the provision for loan and lease losses and the establishment of an allowance for loan and lease losses. Increases in expected cash flows will generally result in a reduction in any allowance for loan and lease losses established subsequent to acquisition and an increase in the accretable yield through a reclassification from the nonaccretable difference.The adjusted accretable yield is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans. Disposals of loans, which may include sales of loans to third parties, receipt of payments in full or part by the borrower, and foreclosure of the collateral result in removal of the loan from the purchased credit-impaired loan portfolio at its carrying amount.
Because the initial fair value of PCI loans recorded at acquisition includes an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, we separately track and report PCI loans and exclude these loans from our delinquency and nonperforming loan statistics.Even though substantially all of these loans are 90 days or more contractually past due, they are considered to be accruing because the interest income on these loans relates to the establishment of an accretable yield that is accreted into interest income over the estimated life of the purchased credit-impaired loans using the effective yield method.
For acquired loans that are not deemed impaired at acquisition, subsequent to acquisition we recognize the difference between the initial fair value at acquisition and the undiscounted expected cash flows in interest incomeover the life of the loans using the effective yield method.
Loan Modifications and Restructurings As part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may make loan modifications that are intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral.We may provide short-term (three to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term loan performance and collectability.Our modifications typically include a reduction in the borrowers initial monthly or quarterly principal and interest payment through an extension of the loan term, a reduction in the interest rate, or a combination of both.For credit card loan agreements, such modifications may include canceling the customers available line of credit on the credit card, reducing the interest rate on the card, and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. These modifications may result in our receiving the full amount due, or certain installments due, under the loan over a period of time that is longer than the period of time originally provided for under the terms of the loan.In some cases, we may curtail the amount of principal owed by the borrower.
101 Table of Contents A loan modification in which a concession is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty is accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR).We describe our accounting for and measurement of impairment on restructured loans below under Impaired Loans.See Note 5Loans for additional information on our loan modifications and restructurings.
Delinquent and Nonperforming Loans The entire balance of a loan is considered contractually delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by thefirst statement cycle date equal to or following the due date specified on the customers billing statement.Delinquency is reported on loans that are 30 are more days past due.Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, if applicable. We generally place loans on nonaccrual status when we believe the collectability of interest and principal is not reasonably assured.
Nonperforming loans generally include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and certain restructured loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty.We do not report loans accounted for under the fair value option and loans held for sale as nonperforming.
Our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming, by loan category, are as follows:  Credit card loans: As permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), our policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being classified as nonperforming as these loans are generally charged off in the period the account becomes 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, we generally continue to accrue interest and fees on delinquent credit card loans until the loans are charged-off.When we do not expect full payment of billed finance charges and fees, we reduce the balance of the credit card account by the estimated uncollectible portion of any billed finance charges and fees and exclude this amount from revenue.
Consumer loans: We classify other non-credit card consumer loans as nonperforming at the earlier of the date when we determine that the collectability of interest or principal on the loan is not reasonably assured or in the period in which the loan becomes 90 days past due for automobile and mortgage loans,180 days past due for unsecured small business revolving lines of credit and120 days past due for all other non-credit card consumer loans, including installment loans.
Commercial loans : We classify commercial loans as nonperforming at the earlier of the date we determine that the collectability of interest or principal on the loan is not reasonably assured or in the period that the loan becomes 90 days past due.
Modified loans and troubled debt restructurings: Modified loans, including TDRs, that are current at the time of the restructuring remain on accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and continued performance under the modified terms is expected. Otherwise, the modified loan is classified as nonperforming and placed on nonaccrual status until the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance over several payment cycles, generally six months of consecutive payments, under the modified terms of the loan.
Purchased credit-impaired loans : PCI loans primarily include loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank, which we recorded at fair value at acquisition.Because the initial fair value of these loans included an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, our subsequent accounting for PCI loans differs from the accounting for non-PCI loans.We therefore separately track and report PCI loans and exclude these loans from our delinquency and nonperforming loan statistics.
Interest and fees accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status are reversed against earnings.In addition, the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended.Interest and fee income is subsequently recognized only upon the receipt of cash payments. However, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of loan principal, all cash received is applied against the principal balance of the loan. Nonaccrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when all principal and interest is current and repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured or when the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection and collectability is no longer doubtful.
Impaired Loans A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. Loans with insignificant delays or insignificant short falls in the amount of payments expected to be collected are not considered to be impaired. Income recognition on impaired loans is consistent with that of nonaccrual loans discussed above under Delinquent and Nonperforming Loans.
102 Table of Contents Loans defined as individually impaired, based on applicable accounting guidance, include larger balance nonperforming loans and TDR loans.
Our policies for reporting loans as individually impaired, by loan category, are as follows:  Credit card loans: Credit card loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring are accounted for and reported as individually impaired.
Consumer loans: Consumer loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring are accounted for and reported as individually impaired.
Commercial loans: Commercial loans classified as nonperforming and commercial loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring are reported as impaired.
Purchased credit-impaired loans :We track and report PCI loans separately from other impaired loans.
We do not report nonperformingconsumer loans that have not been modified in a TDR as individually impaired, as we collectively evaluate these smaller-balance homogenous loans for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.
Held for sale loans are also not reported as impaired, as these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value.
All individually impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance.Once a loan is modified in a troubled debt restructuring, the loan is generally considered impaired until maturity regardless of whether the borrower performs under the modified terms.Although the loan may be returned to accrual status if the criteria above under Delinquent and Nonperforming Loans are met, the loan would continue to be evaluated for an asset-specific allowance for loan losses and we would continue to report the loan as impaired.
We generally measure impairment and the related asset-specific allowance for individually impaired loans based on the difference between the recorded investment of the loan and present value of the loans expected future cash flows, discounted at the effective original interest rate of the loan at the time of modification or the loans observable market price. If the loan is collateral dependent, we measure impairment based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral, which we determine based on the current fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs, instead of discounted cash flows.Loans are identified as collateral dependent if we believe that collateral is the sole source of repayment.
If the fair value of the loan is less than the recorded investment, we recognize impairment by establishing an allowance for the loan or by adjusting an allowance for the impaired loan. See Note 6Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses for additional information on the asset-specific component of our allowance.
Charge-Offs Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and fraud losses from charge-offs.Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Costs incurred to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expense and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense. Our charge-off time frame for loans, which varies based on the loan type, is presented below.
Credit card loans: We generally charge-off credit card loans when the account is 180 days past due from the statement cycle date. Credit card loans in bankruptcy are charged-off within 30 days of receipt of a complete bankruptcy notification from the bankruptcy court, except for U.K. credit card loans, which are charged-offs within 60 days.Credit card loans of deceased account holders are charged-off within 60 days of receipt of notification.
Consumer loans: Wegenerally charge-off consumer loans at the earlier of the date when the account is a specified number of days past due or upon repossession of the underlying collateral. Our charge-off time frame is 180 days for mortgage loans and unsecured small business lines of credit and 120 days for auto and other non-credit cardconsumer loans.We calculate the charge-off amount for mortgage loans based on the difference betweenour recorded investment in the loanand thefair value of the underlying property and estimated selling costsas of the date of the charge-off. We update our home value estimates on a regular basis and recognize additional charge-offs for declines in home values below our initial fair value and selling cost estimate at the date mortgage loans are charged-off.Consumer loans in bankruptcy, except for auto and mortgage loans, generally arecharged-off within 40 days of receipt ofnotification from the bankruptcy court.Auto and mortgage loans in bankruptcyare charged-off in the period that the loan is both 60 days or more past due and 60 days or more past the bankruptcy notification date or in the period theloan becomes 120 days past due for auto loans and 180 days past due for mortgage loans regardless of the banruptcy notification date. Consumer loans of deceased account holders are charged-off within 60 days of receipt of notification.
103 Table of Contents  Commercial loans : We charge-off commercial loans in the period we determine that the unpaid principal loan amounts are uncollectible.
Purchased credit-impaired loans :We do not record charge-offs on PCI loans that are performing in accordance with or better than our expectations as of the date of acquisition, as the fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component.We record charge-offs on purchased credit-impaired loans only if actual losses exceed estimated losses incorporated into the fair value recorded at acquisition.
Foreclosed Property and Repossessed Assets Foreclosed property and repossessed assets are comprised of any asset or property acquired through loan restructurings, workouts, foreclosure proceeding or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.Acquired p roperty may include commercial and residential real estate properties or personal property, such as autos.
Upon repossession of property acquired in satisfaction of a loan, we reclassify the loan to repossessed assets and record the acquired property at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs.
We estimate fair values primarily based on appraisals, when available, or quoted market prices on liquid assets. Anticipated recoveries from private mortgage insurance and government guarantees are also considered in evaluating the potential impairment of loans at the date of transfer. When the anticipated future cash flows associated with a loan are less than its net carrying value, a charge-off is recognized against the allowance for loan losses.
We regularly evaluate the fair value of acquired property and subsequently record at the lower of the amount recorded at acquisition or the current fair value less estimated disposition costs. Any valuation adjustments on acquired property or gains or losses realized from disposition of the property are reflected in non-interest expense.
Foreclosed property and repossessed assets, which we report in our consolidated balance sheet under other assets, totaled $306 million and $20 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2010, compared with $234 million and $24 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2009.
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses We maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses (the allowance) that represents managements best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent in our held-for-investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date.
We do not maintain an allowance for held-for-sale loans or purchased-credit impaired loans that are performing in accordance with or better than our expectations as of the date of acquisition, as the fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component.The allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for loan and lease losses and reduced by net charge-offs.The provision for loan and lease losses, which is charged to earnings, reflects credit losses we believe have been incurred and will eventually be reflected over time in our charge-offs.Charge-offs of uncollectible amounts are deducted from the allowance and subsequent recoveries are added.
In determining the allowance for loan and lease losses, we disaggregate loans in our portfolio with similar credit risk characteristics into portfolio segments.Management performs quarterly analysis of these portfolios to determine if impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowance based on historical and current trends and other factors affecting credit losses. We apply documented systematic methodologies to separately calculate the allowance for our consumer loan and commercial loan portfolio and for loans within each of these portfolios that we identify as individually impaired. Our allowance for loan and lease losses consists of three components that are allocated to cover the estimated probable losses in each loan portfolio based on the results of our detailed review and loan impairment assessment process:(1) a formula-based component for loans collectively evaluated for impairment; (2) an asset-specific component for individually impaired loans; and (3) a component related to purchased credit-impaired loans that have experienced significant decreases in expected cash flows subsequent to acquisition.
Our consumer loan portfolio consists of smaller-balance, homogeneous loans, divided into four primary portfolio segments:credit card loans, auto loans, residential home loans and retail banking loans.Each of these portfolios is further divided by our business units into pools based on common risk characteristics, such as origination year, contract type, interest rate and geography, that are collectively evaluated for impairment. The commercial loan portfolio is primarily composed of larger-balance, non-homogeneous loans.These loans are subject to individual reviews that result in risk ratings.In assessing the risk rating of a particular loan, among the factors we consider are the financial condition of the borrower, geography, collateral performance, historical loss experience, and industry-specific information that management believes is relevant in determining the occurrence of a loss event and measuring impairment. These factors are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, and involve subjective assessment and interpretation. Emphasizing one factor over another or considering additional factors could impact the risk rating assigned to that loan.
104 Table of Contents The formula-based component of the allowance for credit card and other consumer loans that we collectively evaluate for impairment is based on a statistical calculation. Because of the homogenous nature of our consumer loan portfolios, the allowance is based on the aggregated portfolio segment evaluations. The allowance is established through a process that begins with estimates of incurred losses in each pool based upon various statistical analyses. Loss forecast models are utilized to estimate incurred losses and consider several portfolio indicators including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, account seasoning, the value of collateral underlying secured loans, estimated foreclosures or defaults based on observable trends, delinquencies, bankruptcy filings, unemployment and credit bureau scores, and general economic and business trends. Management believes these factors are relevant in estimating incurred losses and also considers an evaluation of overall portfolio credit quality based on indicators such as changes in our credit evaluation, underwriting and collection management policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment, general economic conditions and business trends and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance. We update our consumer loss forecast models and portfolio indicators on a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflective of the current economic environment.
The formula-based component of the allowance for commercial loans that we collectively evaluate for impairment is based on our historical loss experienceforloans with similar risk characteristics and consideration of the current credit quality of the portfolio, supplemented by management judgment and interpretation. We apply internal risk ratings to commercial loans, which we use to assess credit quality and derive a total loss estimate based on an estimatedprobability of default (default rate) and loss given default (loss severity). We generally use the prior four-year actual portfolio credit loss experience to develop our estimate of credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of each balance sheet date.Management may also apply judgment to adjust the loss factors derived, taking into consideration both quantitative and qualitative factors, including general economic conditions, specific industry and geographic trends, portfolio concentrations, trends in internal credit quality indicators and current and past underwriting standards that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the historical data underlying our loss estimates.
The asset-specific component of the allowance covers smaller-balance homogenous credit card and consumer loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR and larger balance nonperforming, non-homogenous commercial loans.
As discussed above under Impaired Loans, w e measure the asset-specific component of the allowance based on the difference between the recorded investment of individually impaired loans and the present value of expected future cash flows.
When the present value is lower than the carrying value of the loan, impairment is recognized through the provision for loan and lease losses.
The asset specific component of the allowance for smaller-balance impaired loans is calculated on a pool basis using historical loss experience for the respective class of assets. T he asset-specific component of the allowance for larger-balance, commercial loans is individually calculated for each loan.Key considerations in determining the allowance include the borrowers overall financial condition, resources and payment history, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, and when applicable, the estimated realizable value of any collateral.
Purchased credit-impaired loans are recorded at fair value at acquisition and applicable accounting guidance prohibits the carry over or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting for impaired loans acquired in a transfer. Subsequent to acquisition, decreases in expected principal cash flows of purchased impaired loans are recorded as a valuation allowance included in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Subsequent increases in expected principal cash flows result in a recovery of any previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses, to the extent applicable. Write-downs on purchased impaired loans in excess of the nonaccretable difference are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses.See Note 5Loans for information on purchased credit-impaired portfolios associated with acquisitions.
In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit and financial guarantees, and binding unfunded loan commitments. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments excludes commitments accounted for under the fair value option.The provision for unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for loan and lease losses on our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.Unfunded lending commitments are subject to individual reviews and are analyzed and segregated by risk according to our internal risk rating scale.We assess these risk classifications, in conjunction with historical loss experience, utilization assumptions, current economic conditions, performance trends within specific portfolio segments and other pertinent information to estimate the reserve for unfunded lending commitments.
105 Table of Contents While we attribute portions of the allowance to components across our lending portfolios, the entire allowance is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in our total lending portfolio.Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowances for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments in future periods.
Special Purpose Entities and Variable Interest Entities In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued two new accounting standards that amended guidance applicable to the accounting for transfers of financial assets and the consolidation of VIEs.The guidance in these new consolidation accounting standards was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. We adopted the new consolidation accounting standards on January 1, 2010.Prior to January 1, 2010, our securitization trusts generally met the definition of a QSPE and were therefore not subject to consolidation. The new consolidation accounting standards eliminated the concept of a QSPE, requiring that entities previously considered as QSPEs be evaluated for consolidation.Based on our evaluation, we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of all of our credit card and auto securitization trusts, one installment loan securitization trust and certain mortgage securitization trusts because of the combination of our power over the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts through the right to service the securitized loans and our obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the trusts through our retained interests.Therefore, effective January 1, 2010, we consolidated on our balance sheet the underlying assets and liabilities of these trusts.We recorded the assets and liabilities of the credit card and installment loan securitization trusts at their carrying amounts as of January 1, 2010.We recorded the assets and liabilities of the mortgage trusts at their unpaid principal balances as of January 1, 2010, with accrued interest, allowance for loan and lease losses or other-than-temporary impairment recognized as appropriate, using the practical expedient permitted upon adoption because we determined that calculation of carrying values was not practical.
Below we present the impact on our January 1, 2010 consolidated balance sheet from the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards: (Dollars in millions) January1, 2010 VIE Consolidation Impact December31, 2009 Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 12,683 $ 3,998 $ 8,685 Loans held for investment 138,184 47,565 90,619 Less: Allowance for loan and lease losses (8,391 ) (4,264 ) (1) (4,127 ) Net loans held for investment 129,793 43,301 86,492 Accounts receivable from securitizations 166 (7,463 ) 7,629 Other assets 68,869 2,029 66,840 Total assets $ 211,511 $ 41,865 $ 169,646 Liabilities: Securitized debt obligations $ 48,300 $ 44,346 $ 3,954 Other liabilities 139,560 458 139,102 Total liabilities 187,860 44,804 143,056 Total stockholders equity 23,651 (2,939 ) (1) 26,590 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 211,511 $ 41,865 $ 169,646 ____________ (1) In the second quarter of 2010, an adjustment of $53 million was made to increase the allowance for loan and lease losses for the impact of impairment on consolidated loans accounted for as troubled debt restructurings, and a related $34 million, net of taxes, was recorded as a reduction to stockholders' equity. These adjustments are not reflected in the above table.
Consolidation of $47.6 billion in securitized loan receivables and $44.3 billion in related debt securities issued from the trusts to third party investors. Included in the total loan receivables is $1.5 billion of mortgage loan securitizations related to the Chevy Chase Bank acquisition which had not been included in our historical managed financial statements. Also included in total loan receivables are $2.6 billion of retained interests, previously classified as accounts receivable from securitizations.
Reclassification of $0.7 billion of net finance charge and fee receivables from accounts receivable from securitizations to loans held for investment.
Reclassification of $4.0 billion in accounts receivable from securitization to cash restricted for securitization investors.
106 Table of Contents  Recording a $4.3 billion allowance for loan and lease losses for the newly consolidated loan receivables. Previously, the losses inherent in the off-balance sheet loans were captured as a reduction in the valuation of retained residual interests.
Recording derivative assets of $0.3 billion and derivative liabilities of $0.5 billion, representing the fair value of interest rate swaps and foreign currency derivatives entered into by the trusts.
Recording net deferred tax assets of $1.6 billion, largely related to establishing an allowance for loan and lease losses on the newly consolidated loan receivables.
Subsequent to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards, our earnings no longer reflect securitization and servicing income related to the consolidated loans underlying our securitization trusts. Instead, we report interest income, provision for loan and lease losses and certain other income associated with consolidated securitized loans and interest expense associated with the debt securities issued from the trusts to third party investors. Amounts are recorded in the same categories as non-securitized loan receivables and corporate debt. Additionally, we treat consolidated securitized loans as secured borrowings.Therefore, we will no longer recognizegains on loans transferred in a securitization transaction unless the transfer qualifies for sale accounting and meets the criteria for deconsolidation under the new consolidation accounting standards.
On January 21, 2010, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Reserve Board (the Federal Reserve) announced a final rule regarding capital requirements related to the adoption of new consolidation guidance which requires additional capital in relation to our consolidated assets and any associated creation of loan loss reserves to be held. The rule allows for two quarter deferral in implementing the capital requirements with a phase out of the deferral beginning in the third quarter of 2010 and ending in the first quarter of 2011. We are utilizing this available deferral and the capital ratios reflect this treatment.
We recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $2.9 billion in stockholders equity on January 1, 2010 from the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards. The table below summarizes the impact on certain regulatory capital ratios resulting from January 1, 2010 adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards: January1, 2010 December31, 2009 Change Tier 1 capital 9.93 % 13.75 % (3.82 )% Total capital 17.58 17.70 (0.12 ) Tier 1 leverage 5.84 10.28 (4.44 ) Securitization of Loans We primarily securitize credit card loans, auto loans, home loans and installment loans. Securitizations have historically been utilized for liquidity and funding purposes. See Note 7Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations and Note 8Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional details.Loan securitization involves the transfer of a pool of loan receivables from our portfolio to a trust from which the trust sells an undivided interest in the pool of loan receivables to third-party investors through the issuance of debt securities. The debt securities are collateralized by the transferred receivables from our portfolio, and we receive proceeds from the third-party investors in consideration for the loans transferred. We remove loans from our consolidated balance sheet when securitizations qualify as sales to non-consolidated VIEs. Alternatively, when the transfer does not qualify as a sale but instead is considered a secured borrowing or when the sale is to a consolidated VIE, the asset will remain on our consolidated financial statements with an offsetting liability recognized for the amount of proceeds received.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to January 1, 2009 represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired.Goodwill resulting from business combinations after January 1, 2009, is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. Rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on our consolidated balance sheets.
We have elected October 1 as the date to perform our annual goodwill impairment test.Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized either on a straight-line or on an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives and evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.
107 Table of Contents Other Assets We report our investment in Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock, which totaled $269 million and $264 million as of December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and our investment in Federal Reserve stock, which totaled $861 million and $778 million, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. We carry these investments at cost and assess for other-than-temporary impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance for evaluating impairment. We did not recognize any impairment on these investments in 2010 or 2009.
Mortgage Servicing Rights Mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) are recorded at fair value when mortgage loans are sold or securitized in the secondary market and the right to service these loans is retained for a fee. Changes in fair value are recognized in mortgage servicing and other income. We continue to operateamortgage servicing business andreport the changes in the fair value of MSRs in earnings. To evaluate and measure fair value, the underlying loans are stratified based on certain risk characteristics, including loan type, note rate and investor servicing requirements. We determine the fair value of MSRs based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows of net servicing income. We use assumptions in the valuation model that market participants use when estimating future net servicing income, including prepayment speeds, discount rates, default rates, cost to service, escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late fees. This model is highly sensitive to changes in certain assumptions. Different anticipated prepayment speeds, in particular, can result in substantial changes in the estimated fair value of MSRs. If actual prepayment experience differs from the anticipated rates used in the model, this difference could result in a material change inthevalue of our MSRs.
MSRs, which are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $141 million and $240 million as of December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Our acquisition of Chevy Chase Bank resulted in additional mortgage servicing rights of $110 million as of the acquisition date. See Note 8Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Note 7Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations for additional information.
Upon adoption of the accounting consolidation guidance, certain mortgage loans that had been securitized and accounted for as a sale were subject to consolidation and accounted for as a secured borrowing. Accordingly, effective January1, 2010, mortgage securitization trusts that contain approximately $1.6 billion of mortgage loans and related debt securities issued to third party investors were consolidated and the retained interests and mortgage servicing rights related to these newly consolidated trusts were eliminated in consolidation. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies andNote 8Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional information.
Fair Value Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date (also referred to as an exit price).The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. Fair value measurement of afinancial asset or liability is assigned to a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant tothe fair value measurementin its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Observable market-based inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs.
Under the fair value accounting guidance, an entity has the irrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-contract basis, to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at inception of the contract and thereafter, with any changes in fair value recorded in current earnings. We did not make any material fair value option elections as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
See Note 19Fair Value of Financial Instruments for additional information.
108 Table of Contents Representation and Warranty Reserve In connection with their sales of mortgage loans, our subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the loans compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser, including underwriting guidelines and the ongoing existence of mortgage insurance, and the loans compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. We may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan, indemnify the investor or insurer, or reimburse the investor for credit losses incurred on the loan in the event of a material breach of contractual representations or warranties.
We have established representation and warranty reserves for losses that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary, including both litigation and non-litigation liabilities.The reserve-setting process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires the application of judgment.In establishing the representation and warranty reserves, we consider a variety of factors, depending on the category of purchaser and rely on historical data.We evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis.Losses incurred on loans that we are required to either repurchase or make payments to the investor under the indemnification provisions are charged against the reserve. The representation and warranty reserve is included in other liabilities. Changes to the representation and warranty reserve related to GreenPoint are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.See Note 21Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees for additional information related to our representation and warranty reserve.
Rewards Liability We offers products, primarily credit cards, that provide reward program members with various rewards such as airline tickets, free or deeply discounted products or cash rebates, based on account activity. We establish a rewards liability based upon points earned which are ultimately expected to be redeemed and the average cost per point redemption. As points are redeemed, the rewards liability is relieved. The estimated cost of reward programs is primarily reflected as a reduction to interchange income. The cost of reward programs related to securitized loans is deducted from servicing and securitizations income.Rewards liability totaled $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion as of December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities In accordance with applicable accounting standards, all derivative financial instruments, whether designated for hedge accounting or not, are reported at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities.
Derivatives in a net asset position are included on in other assets, and derivatives in a net liability position are included in other liabilities.
Our policy is not to offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value executed with the same counterparty under master netting arrangements. As of December31, 2010 and 2009, we had recorded $229 million and $254 million, respectively, for the right to retain cash collateral and $668 million and $338 million, respectively, for the obligation to return cash collateral. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains and losses) of a derivative instrument differs based on whether the derivative has been designated as a qualifying accounting hedge and the type of accounting hedge.For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments we must designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in current earnings during the period of the change in fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item, if any, is recognized in current earnings during the period of change. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, the gain or loss is reported in other comprehensive income as part of the cumulative translation adjustment to the extent it is effective. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss is recognized in current earnings during the period of change in the fair value.
We also enter into derivative agreements with our customers to transfer, modify or reduce their interest rate or foreign exchange risks. As part of this process, we consider the customers suitability for the risk involved, and the business purpose for the transaction. These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and are considered trading derivatives with changes in fair value recognized in current period earnings. See Note 11Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for additional detail.
109 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition We recognize earned finance charges, interest income and fees on loans in interest income in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements.As discussed above under LoansDelinquent and Nonperforming Loans, interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, if applicable. Interest and fees accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status are reversed against earnings.
Finance charges and fees on credit card loans are included in loan receivables when billed to the customer. We continue to accrue finance charges and fees on credit card loans until the account is charged-off.However, when we do not expect full payment of billed finance charges and fees, we reduce the balance of our credit card loan receivables by the amount of finance charges billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue.Our methodology for estimating the uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for incurred principal losses on our credit card loan receivables. Revenue wasreduced by $950 million, $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, for the estimated uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees.
Interchange income is a discount on the payment due from the card-issuing bank to the merchant bank through the interchange network. Interchange rates are set by MasterCard International Inc. (MasterCard) and Visa U.S.A. Inc. (Visa) and are based on cardholder purchase volumes. We recognize interchange income as earned.Annual membership fees and direct loan origination costs specific to credit card loans are deferred and amortized over one year on a straight-line basis.Fees and origination costs and premiums are deferred and amortized over the average life of the related loans using the interest method for auto, home loan and commercial loan originations. Direct loan origination costs consist of both internal and external costs associated with the origination of a loan. Unamortized deferred fees, net of deferred costs, totaled $250 million and $148 million as of December31, 2010 and 2009.
Marketing Expense We expense marketing costs as incurred. Television advertising costs are expensed during the period in which the advertisements are aired.We recognized marketing expense of $1.0 billion, $0.6 billion and $1.1 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Fraud Losses We experience fraud losses from the unauthorized use of credit cards, debit cards and customer bank accounts. Additional fraud losses may be incurred when loans are obtained through fraudulent means. Transactions suspected of being fraudulent are charged to non-interest expense after an investigation period.Recoveries of fraud losses also are also included in non-interest expense. See Note 15Other Non-Interest Expense for additional information. .
Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with the accounting guidance for income taxes, recognizing the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. See Note 18Income Taxes for additional details.
Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards We adopted the following recently issued accounting standards in 2010.
Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses In July 2010, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that requires additional disclosures about an entitys allowance for credit losses and the credit quality of its loan portfolio.The guidance requires additional disclosure to facilitate financial statement users evaluation of the following: (1)the nature of credit risk inherent in the entitys loan portfolio, (2)how that risk is analyzed and assessed in arriving at the allowance for loan losses, and (3)the changes and reasons for those changes in the allowance for loan losses. The increased disclosures as of the end of a reporting period are effective for periods ending on or after December15, 2010. Increased disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after December31, 2010. We adopted the accounting standard as of December 31, 2010, except for certain activity-related disclosures for which the adoption date is yet to be determined by the FASB. The adoption of this new standard enhanced the information provided on our loans and allowance for loan and lease losses in Note 5Loans and Note 6Allowance for Loan and Lease Lossesbut did not have an impact on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
110 Table of Contents Effect of a Loan Modification When the Loan Is Part of a Pool That Is Accounted for as a Single Asset In April 2010, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on loan modifications inside a pool of loans accounted for as a single asset.This new guidance states that loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality, which are accounted for within pools, and are modified will not trigger the removal of those loans from the pool even if the modification of those loans would otherwise be considered a TDR. An entity will continue to be required to consider whether the pool of assets in which the loan is included is impaired if expected cash flows for the pool change.Upon initial adoption,an entityis allowedto make a one-time election to terminate its accounting for loans as a pool. This guidance iseffective for our first fiscal quarter ending on or after July 15, 2010, and is to be applied prospectively.The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our accounting or disclosures regarding our acquired loan portfolio.
Scope Exception for Embedded Credit Derivatives In March 2010, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on embedded credit derivatives.This new accounting guidance clarifies the scope exception for embedded credit derivatives and defines which embedded credit derivatives are required to be evaluated for bifurcation and separate accounting.The guidance is effective on the first day of the first fiscal quarter beginning after June 15, 2010. In the third quarter, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings of $16 million, related to the adoption of this accounting guidance.
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements In January 2010, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on improving disclosures about fair value measurements which amends the guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures. The new guidance requires disclosure of significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2009 and requires separate disclosures be presented for the gross amount of Level 3 activity for purchases, sales, issuances and settlements for fiscal years beginning December 15, 2010. The adoption of this new accounting guidance to disclose significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2and activity inLevel 3 ofthe fair value hierarchy did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation of VIEs In June 2009, the FASB issued two new accounting standards that amended guidance applicable to the accounting for transfers of financial assets and the consolidation of VIEs. The guidance in these standards was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. The accounting standard for transfers of financial assets was applicable on a prospective basis to new transfers, while the accounting standard relating to consolidation of VIEs was required to be applied prospectively to all entities within its scope as of the date of adoption. Effective January 1, 2010, we prospectively adopted these new accounting standards.As shown above under Special Purpose Entities and Variable Interest Entities, the adoption of these new consolidation accounting standards on January 1, 2010 resulted in a cumulative effect after-tax charge to retained earnings of $2.9 billion.
NOTE 2ACQUISITIONS AND RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES Acquisitions On February27, 2009, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Chevy Chase Bank in exchange for our common stock and cash with a total value of $476 million. Under the terms of the stock purchase agreement, Chevy Chase Bank common stockholders received $445 million in cash and 2.56million shares of our common stock. In addition, to the extent that losses on certain of Chevy Chase Banks mortgage loans are less than the level reflected in the net expected principal losses estimated at the time the deal was signed, we will share a portion of the benefit with the former Chevy Chase Bank common stockholders (the earn-out). The maximum payment under the earn-out is $300 million and would occur after December31, 2013.We have not recognized a liability related to this earn-out as of December31, 2010 or 2009, and we currently do not expect to make any payments associated with the earn-out based on estimated credit losses related to this portfolio. Subsequent to the closing of the acquisition all of the outstanding shares of preferred stock of a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevy Chase Bank and the subordinated debt of its wholly-owned REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) subsidiary, were redeemed.Subsequent to acquisition, Chevy Chase Banks results of operations are reflected in our consolidated financial statements.
111 Table of Contents Restructuring Activities In 2009, we completed the broad-based initiative started in 2007 to reduce expenses and improve our competitive cost position . Restructuring initiatives leveraged the capabilities of infrastructure projects in several of our businesses. The scope and timing of the cost reductions were the result of an ongoing, comprehensive review of operations within and across our businesses.
Total incurred charges exceeded the original estimate of $300 million by $63 million. The increase occurred because we extended the initiative past the original timeline due to the continued economic deterioration. Approximately half of these charges were related to severance benefits, while the remaining charges were associated with items such as contract and lease terminations and consolidation of facilities and infrastructure. We recognized restructuring expense of $119 million and $134 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively.We did not recognize any restructuring expense in 2010.
NOTE 3DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Shutdown of Mortgage Origination Operations of Wholesale Mortgage Banking Unit In the third quarter of 2007, we closed the mortgage origination operationsof our wholesale mortgage banking unit, acquired by us in December 2006 as part of the North Fork acquisition. The results of the mortgage origination operations and wholesale banking unit have been accounted for as a discontinued operation and therefore not included in our results from continuing operations in 2010, 2009 and 2008. We have no significant continuing involvement in these operations.
The loss from discontinued operations for 2010, 2009 and 2008 includes an expense of $432 million ($304 million net of tax), $162 million ($120 million net of tax) and $104 million ($68 million net of tax) , respectively, recorded in non-interest expense, primarily attributable to provisions for mortgage loan repurchase losses related to representations and warranties provided on loans previously sold to third parties by the wholesale banking unit.
The following table summarizes the results from discontinued operations related to the closure of our wholesale mortgage banking unit: Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net interest income (expense) $ (1 ) $ (2 ) $ 7 Non-interest expense (475 ) (157 ) (209 ) Income tax benefit 169 56 71 Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes $ (307 ) $ (103 ) $ (131 ) The discontinued mortgage origination operations of our wholesale home loan banking unit had remaining assets of $ 362 million and $24 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, consisting primarily of mortgage loans held for sale and liabilities of $ 585 million and $229 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively consisting primarily of obligations for representations and warranties that we provided on loans previously sold to third parties.

All of our agency securities were rated AAA as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The table below presents information on the credit ratings of our non-agency CMOs, non-agency MBS and asset-backed securities, which account for the substantial majority of the unrealized losses related to our investment securities portfolio as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairment We evaluate all securities in an unrealized loss position at least quarterly, and more often as market conditions require, to assess whether the impairment is other-than-temporary.Our OTTI assessment is a subjective process requiring the use of judgments and assumptions.Accordingly, we consider a number of qualitative and quantitative criteria in our assessment, including the extent and duration of the impairment; recent events specific to the issuer and/or industry to which the issuer belongs; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings and the failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments; the value of underlying collateral; and current market conditions.
Effective April 1, 2009, we adopted new accounting guidance that changed our method for assessing, measuring and recognizing OTTI. Under this guidance, if we determine that impairment on our debt securities is other-than-temporary and we have made the decision to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, we recognize the entire portion of the impairment in earnings.If we have not made a decision to sell the security and we do not expect that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis, we recognize only the credit component of OTTI in earnings. The remaining unrealized loss due to factors other than credit, or the non-credit component, is recorded in AOCI.We determine the credit component based on the difference between the securitys amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows, discounted based on the purchase yield.The non-credit component represents the difference between the securitys fair value and the present value of expected future cash flows.Prior to the adoption of this new accounting guidance, the entire unrealized loss amount related to a security that was determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired was recognized in earnings.
The following table summarizes other-than-temporary impairment losses on debt securities recognized in earnings in 2010, 2009 and 2008.
Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Total OTTI losses $ 128 $ 287 $ 11 Less:Non-credit component of OTTI losses recorded in AOCI (63 ) (255 ) 0 Net OTTI losses recognized in earnings $ 65 $ 32 $ 11 As indicated in the table above, we recorded credit related losses in earnings totaling $65 million and $32 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The cumulative non-credit related portion of OTTI on these securities recorded in AOCI totaled $105 million and $181 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. We estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model, and we estimate the expected cash flows from the underlying collateral using industry-standard third party modeling tools.These tools take into consideration security specific delinquencies, product specific delinquency roll rates and expected severities.Key assumptions used in estimating the expected cash flows include default rates, loss severity and prepayment rates.Assumptions used can vary widely based on the collateral underlying the securities and are influenced by factors such as collateral type, loan interest rate, geographical location of the borrower, and borrower characteristics.
116 Table of Contents We believe the gross unrealized losses related to all other securities of $176 million and $368 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, are attributable to issuer specific credit spreads and changes in market interest rates and asset spreads.We therefore do not expect to incur any credit losses related to these securities. In addition, we have no intent to sell these securities with unrealized losses and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost.Accordingly, we have concluded that the impairment on these securities is not other-than-temporary.

NOTE 5LOANS Loan Portfolio Composition Our total loan portfolio consists of loans we own and loans underlying our securitization trusts.Prior to our January 1, 2010 adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards, loans underlying our securitization trusts were accounted for as off-balance sheet.These loans are now reported on our consolidated balance sheet under restricted loans for securitization investors.The table below presents the composition of our held-for investment loan portfolio, including restricted loans for securitization investors, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.
The substantial increase in loans held for investment reported on our consolidated balance sheets was due to the addition of $47.6 billion of loans held for investment, primarily consisting of credit card loan receivables underlying our securitization trusts, to our consolidated balance sheet on January 1, 2010 as a result of the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards.After taking into consideration the January 1, 2010 consolidation impact, loans held for investment decreased by $12.2 billion, or 10%, in 2010 to $125.9 billion as of December 31, 2010.
The decline was primarily due to the run-off of loans in businesses that we either exited or repositioned early in the economic recession, elevated charge-offs and weak consumer demand. Additionally, the decline was attributable to the sale of a portion of the small-ticket commercial real estate loan portfolio in 2010. The decline was partially offset by the acquisition of the $807 million legacy Sony Card portfolio in the third quarter of 2010.

118 Table of Contents Credit Quality We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk.
Trends in delinquency ratios are an indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within our loan portfolios. The level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses.Accordingly, key metrics we track and use in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates, as well as charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance, commercial loans. High unemployment, the decline in home prices and other weak economic conditions resulting from the recent recession adversely affected the ability of consumers and businesses to meet their debt obligations and resulting in deterioration across all of our loan portfolios in 2009. As economic conditions began to improve in 2010, credit performance across our loan categories began to improve and stabilize.
The tablefollowing summarizes the payment status of loans in our total loan portfolio, including an aging of delinquent loans, loans 90 days or more past due continuing to accrue interest and loans classified as nonperforming. We present information below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, by major loan category, including key metrics that we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of each of our loan portfolios. The delinquency aging includes all past due loans, both performing and nonperforming, as of December 31, 2010.

For 2009 loans underlying our securitization trust are excludedas they were consolidated on January 1, 2010 uponour adoption of the new consolidation accountingguidance. Loans classified as nonperforming totaled $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
119 Table of Contents Credit Card Our credit card loan portfolio is generally highly diversified across millions of accounts and multiple geographies without significant individual exposures.We therefore generally manage credit risk on a portfolio basis. The risk in our credit card portfolio is correlated with broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, and home values, as well as customer liquidity, which can have a material effect on credit performance.The primary factors we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our credit card portfolio are delinquency and charge-off trends, including an analysis of the migration of loans between delinquency categories over time.The table below displays the geographic profile of our credit card loan portfolio and delinquency statistics as of December 31, 2010.We also present net-charge offs in 2010.

The 30-day delinquency rate for our entire credit card loan portfolio, which consists of loans we own and loans underlying our securitization trusts that were accounted for as off-balance sheet prior to our January 1, 2010 adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards, decreased to 4.29% as of December 31, 2010, from 5.88% as of December 31, 2009.
Consumer Banking Our consumer banking loan portfolio consists of auto, home loan and retail banking loans.Similar to our credit card loan portfolio, the risk in our consumer banking loan portfolio is correlated with broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, and home values, as well as customer liquidity, which can have a material effect on credit performance.Delinquency, nonperforming loans and charge-off trends are key factors we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our consumer banking loan portfolio. The table below displays the geographic profile of our consumer banking loan portfolio, including PCI loans acquired from Chevy Chase Bank.We also present the delinquency and nonperforming loan rates of our consumer banking loan portfolio, excluding PCI loans, as of December 31, 2010 and net-charge offs in 2010.

(2) Credit performance statistics exclude PCI loans, which were recorded at fair value at acquisition.Although PCI loans may be contractually delinquent, we separately track these loans and do not include them in our delinquency and nonperforming loan statistics as the fair value recorded at acquisition included an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans.
Home Loan Our home loan portfolio consists of both first-lien and second-lien residential mortgage loans.
In evaluating the credit quality and risk of our home loan portfolio, we continually monitor a variety of mortgage loan characteristics that may affect the default experience on our overall home loan portfolio, such as vintage, geographic concentrations, lien priority and product type.Certain loan concentrations have experienced higher delinquency rates as a result of the significant decline in home prices since the home price peak in 2006 and rise in unemployment.These loan concentrations include loans originated during 2008, 2007 and 2006 in an environment of decreasing home sales, broadly declining home prices and more relaxed underwriting standards and loans on properties in Arizona, California, Florida and Nevada, which have experienced the most severe decline in home prices.The following table presents the distribution of our home loan portfolio as of December 31, 2010 based on selected key risk characteristics.

Commercial Banking We evaluate the credit risk of commercial loans individually and use a risk-rating system to determine the credit quality of our commercial loans.We assign internal risk grades to loans based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt.In determining the risk rating of a particular loan, among the factors considered are the borrowers current financial condition, historical credit performance, projected future credit performance, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends.T he ratings scale based on our internal risk-rating system is as follows:  Noncriticized: Loans that have not been designated as criticized, frequently referred to as pass loans.
Criticized performing :Loans in which the financial condition of the obligor is stressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or collateral values.The borrower currently has adequate capacity to meet near-term obligations; however, the stress, left unabated, my result in deterioration of the repayment prospects at some future date.
Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any.Loans classified as criticized nonperforming have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, which jeopardize the repayment of the debt.These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain a credit loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
122 Table of Contents We use our internal risk-rating system for regulatory reporting, determining the frequency of review of the credit exposures and evaluation and determination of the allowance for commercial loans.Loans of $1 million or more designated as criticized performing and criticized nonperforming are reviewed quarterly by management for further deterioration or improvement to determine if they are appropriately classified/graded and whether impairment exists. All other loans greater than $1 million are specifically reviewed at least annually to determine the appropriate loan grading.In addition, during the renewal process of any loan, as well if a loan becomes past due, we evaluate the risk rating.

Impaired Loans and Troubled Debt Restructurings A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. Loans with insignificant delays or insignificant short falls in the amount of payments expected to be collected are not considered to be impaired.
Loans defined as individually impaired, based on applicable accounting guidance, include larger balance nonperforming loans and TDR loans.
The following table presents information about our impaired loans, excluding purchased credit-impaired loans, which are reported separately and discussed below: 123 Table of Contents December 31, 2010 (Dollars in millions) With an Allowance Without an Allowance Total Recorded Investment Related Allowance Net Recorded Investment Unpaid Principal Balance Average Recorded Investment Interest Income Recognized Credit card: Domestic $ 753 $ 0 $ 753 $ 253 $ 500 $ 739 $ 644 $ 76 International 160 0 160 133 27 154 128 0 Total credit card 913 0 913 386 527 893 772 76 Consumer: Auto 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Home loan 57 0 57 1 56 57 28 1 Retail banking 23 17 40 1 39 51 46 1 Total consumer 80 17 97 2 95 108 74 2 Commercial: Commercial and multifamily real estate 40 283 323 6 317 436 385 4 Middle market 25 95 120 7 113 156 109 1 Specialty lending 1 20 21 0 21 22 35 0 Total commercial lending 66 398 464 13 451 614 529 5 Small-ticket commercial real estate 16 20 36 2 34 73 41 1 Total commercial 82 418 500 15 485 687 570 6 Other: Other loans 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Total $ 1,075 $ 435 $ 1,510 $ 403 $ 1,107 $ 1,688 $ 1,416 $ 84 TDR loans accounted for $1.1 billion of impaired loans as of December 31, 2010. Consumer and commercial TDR loans classified as performing totaled $79 million and $970 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2010.
We had $1.0 billion in total impaired loans as of December 31, 2009, consisting of impaired credit card and other consumer loans of $323 million and impaired commercial loans of $724 million.TDR loans accounted for $280 million of the impaired loans as of December 31, 2009. Consumer and commercial TDR loans classified as performing totaled $21 million and $239 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2009.The average recorded investment in consumer and commercial impaired loans was $839 million and $686 million, respectively, in 2009.The recorded investment in impaired loans requiring an allowance was $512 million as of December 31, 2009, and the related allowance was $131 million. Interest income recognized on impaired loans totaled $63 million in 2009.
Purchased Credit Impaired Loans In connection with the acquisition of Chevy Chase Bank on February 27, 2009, we acquired loans with a contractual outstanding unpaid principal and interest balance at acquisition of $15.4 billion.We recorded these loans on our consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair value at the date of acquisition of $9.0 billion.We concluded that the substantial majority of the loans we acquired from Chevy Chase Bank were PCI loans. PCI loans are acquired loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination for which it is probable at the date of purchase that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments.The Chevy Chase Bank loans that we concluded were credit impaired had a contractual outstanding unpaid principal and interest balance at acquisition of $12.0 billion and an estimated fair value of $6.3 billion.These loans consisted of Chevy Chase Banks entire portfolio of option-adjustable rate mortgage loans, hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage loans and construction-to-permanent mortgage loans.We also concluded that Chevy Chase Banks portfolio of commercial loans, auto loans, fixed-mortgage loans, home equity loans and other consumer loans included segments of PCI loans.
Initial Fair Value and Accretable Yield of Acquired Loans At acquisition, we estimated the cash flows we expected to collect on these loans. Under the accounting guidance for the PCI loans, the difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. This difference is neither accreted into income nor recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans, using the effective yield method.The table below displays the contractually required principal and interest, cash flows expected to be collected and fair value at acquisition related to the Chevy Chase Bank loans we acquired.The table also displays the nonaccretable difference and the accretable yield at acquisition.

Outstanding Balance and Carrying Value of Acquired Loans The table below presents the outstanding contractual balance and the carrying value of the Chevy Chase Bank acquired loans as of December 31, 2010 and 2009: December 31, 2010 2009 (Dollars in millions) Total Acquired Loans Purchased Credit Impaired Loans Non-Impaired Loans Total Acquired Loans Purchased Credit- Impaired Loans Non-Impaired Loans Contractual balance $ 7,054 $ 5,546 $ 1,508 $ 9,264 $ 7,114 $ 2,150 Carrying value $ 5,554 $ 4,165 $ 1,389 $ 7,251 $ 5,256 $ 1,995 Changes in Accretable Yield of Acquired Loans Subsequent to acquisition, we are required to periodically evaluate our estimate of cash flows expected to be collected. These evaluations, performed quarterly, require the continued use of key assumptions and estimates, similar to the initial estimate of fair value. Subsequent changes in the estimated cash flows expected to be collected may result in changes in the accretable yield and nonaccretable difference or reclassifications from nonaccretable yield to accretable. Increases in the cash flows expected to be collected will generally result in an increase in interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool of loans. Decreases in expected cash flows due to further credit deterioration will generally result in an impairment charge recognized in our provision for loan and lease losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.We recorded impairment through our provision for loan and lease losses of $33 million in 2010 related to these loans.We did not recognize any impairment on these acquired loans in 2009.
125 Table of Contents The following table presents changes in the accretable yield related to the acquired Chevy Chase Bank loans: (Dollars in millions) Total Acquired Loans Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans Non- Impaired Loans Accretable yield as of December 31, 2008 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 Additions from new acquisitions 2,360 1,861 499 Accretion recognized in earnings (293 ) (119 ) (174 ) Accretable yield as of December 31, 2009 2,067 1,742 325 Accretion recognized in earnings (405 ) (299 ) (106 ) Reclassifications from nonaccretable difference for loans with improvement in expected cash flows 350 311 39 Accretable yield as of December 31, 2010 $ 2,012 $ 1,754 $ 258 Unfunded Lending Commitments We manage the potential risk in credit commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements, both by individual customer and in total, by monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios and by applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities. Unused credit card lines available to our customers totaled $161.5 billion and $154.9 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.While these amounts represented the total available unused credit card lines, we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, that all of our customers will access their entire available line at any given point in time.
In addition to available unused credit card lines, we enter into commitments to extend credit that are legally binding conditional agreements having fixed expirations or termination dates and specified interest rates and purposes. These commitments generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards. Collateral requirements and loan-to-value ratios are the same as those for funded transactions and are established based on managements credit assessment of the customer. Commitments may expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future funding requirements. The outstanding unfunded commitments to extend credit other than credit card lines were approximately $13.2 billion and $12.0 billion as of December, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
We maintain a reserve for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit to absorb estimated probable losses related to these unfunded credit facilities in other liabilities, which is presented below in Note 6Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.
NOTE 6ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES We maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses that represents managements best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent in our held-for-investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date.
In determining the allowance for loan and lease losses, we disaggregate loans in our portfolio with similar credit risk characteristics into portfolio segments. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information.
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Activity The allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for loan and lease losses and reduced by net charge-offs.The provision for loan and lease losses, which is charged to earnings, reflects credit losses we believe have been incurred and will eventually be reflected over time in our charge-offs.Charge-offs of uncollectible amounts are deducted from the allowance and subsequent recoveries are included. The table below summarizes changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses, by portfolio segment, for 2010 and 2009.

(2) The carrying amount of liabilities of securitization related VIEs is comprised of obligations to fund negative amortization bonds associated with the securitization of option arm mortgage loans and obligations on certain swap agreements associated with the securitization of manufactured housing loans.
(3) The maximum exposure to loss represents the amount of loss we would incur in the unlikely event that all of our assets in the VIEs became worthless and we were required to meet our maximum remaining funding obligations.
Securitization Related VIEs The majority of our VIE activity is related to our securitization programs which have historically been utilized for liquidity and funding purposes. We receive the proceeds from third party investors for debt securities issued from securitization trusts which are collateralized by transferred receivables from our portfolio. We remove loans from our consolidated balance sheet when securitizations qualify as sales to non-consolidated VIEs. Alternatively, when the transfer does not qualify as a sale, but instead is considered a secured borrowing, or when the sale is to a consolidated VIE, the assets will remain on our consolidated financial statements with an offsetting liability recognized for the amount of proceeds received.
For periods prior to January 1, 2010, we used QSPEs to conduct the majority of our securitization transactions. Those transactions previously qualified as sales to non-consolidated trusts, resulting in off-balance sheet treatment of all of the assets and liabilities of the trusts, including the securitized loans and the securities issued to third parties. Effective January 1, 2010, we adopted the new consolidation guidance which removed the concept of a QSPE resulting in the consolidation of our credit card trusts, one installment loan trust, and certain mortgage trusts. We were considered to be the primary beneficiary of the impacted trusts due to the combination of power over the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts through the right to service the securitized loans and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the trusts through our retained interests.
128 Table of Contents The following table presents the external debt and receivable balances of our securitization programs, information regarding our ongoing involvement in the structures, and any gains/losses recognized on transferred assets for the periods ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.

(2) See information below regarding on-going involvement in the GreenPoint Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) securitizations .
(3) We continue to service some of the outstanding balance of securitized mortgage receivables .
Non-Mortgage Securitizations Prior to consolidation of the applicable QSPEs, the consolidated balance sheet included retained interests in the securitized loans in the form of interest-only strips, retained tranches, cash collateral accounts, cash reserve accounts and unpaid interest and fees on the investors portion of the transferred principal receivables. We also included on our consolidated balance sheet a retained transferors interest in credit card loan receivables transferred to the trusts, carried on a historical cost basis and reported as loans held for investment.
See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for more detail on the impacts of consolidation on our financial statements.See "Mortgage Securitization"below for details relating to our consolidation and de-consolidation of Chevy Chase Bank mortgage securitizations.
On September 15, 2010 we exercised our clean-up call option and paid off the balance of the outstanding notes on the one installment loan securitization program that remained off-balance sheet subsequent to the adoption of the new consolidation guidance.Accordingly, as of December 31, 2010, all remaining non-mortgage securitization structures are consolidated on our financial statements.
Mortgage Securitizations We had previously securitized option arm mortgage loans by transferring loan receivables to trusts, which in turn issued mortgage-backed securities to investors. The outstanding balance of debt securities held by external investors at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $1.3 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. There were no loans transferred into new trusts and no gains recognized during the periods ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 related to securitization activity.
We continue to service some of the outstanding balance of securitized mortgage receivables. We also retain rights to future cash flows arising from the receivables, the most significant being certificated interest-only bonds issued by the trusts, certain of which we sold during the year ended December 31, 2010. We generally estimate the fair value of these retained interests based on the estimated present value of expected future cash flows from securitized and sold receivables, using our best estimates of the key assumptions  credit losses, prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved.
129 Table of Contents In connection with the securitization of certain option arm mortgage loans, a third party is obligated to advance a portion of any negative amortization resulting from monthly payments that are less than the interest accrued for that payment period. We have an agreement in place with the third party that mirrors this advance requirement. The amount advanced is tracked through mortgage-backed securities retained as part of the securitization transaction. As the borrowers make principal payments, these securities receive their net pro rata portion of those payments in cash, and advances of negative amortization are refunded accordingly. As advances occur, we record an asset in the form of negative amortization bonds, which are classified as available-for-sale securities. We have also entered into certain derivative contracts related to the securitization activities. These are classified as free standing derivatives, with fair value adjustments recorded in non-interest income. See Note 11Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for further details on these derivatives.
Prior to January 1, 2010, 21 mortgage securitization trusts were off-balance sheet due to the QSPE exemption from the consolidation provisions of the previous consolidation guidance. Upon the adoption of the new consolidation guidance on January 1, 2010, we were required to consolidate 15 of the mortgage trusts because we were considered the primary beneficiary of the impacted trusts, due to the power held through our servicing rights and due to the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the trusts through the interest-only bonds we retained. As a result of consolidation, we recorded a $1.5 billion increase to loans held for investment, a $73 million increase to the allowance for loan losses, a $1.5 billion increase to securitized debt obligations, a $29 million decrease to other net assets, and a $114 million reduction in stockholders equity. As part of the consolidation, we eliminated retained interests from our consolidated balance sheet, including mortgage servicing rights, interest-only bonds and negative amortization bonds. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
On March 10, 2010, we sold the interest-only bonds associated with each of the consolidated mortgage trusts to a third party. While continuing to service the related loans, we are no longer considered the primary beneficiary of the mortgage trusts because without the interest-only bonds, we no longer have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant nor the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. Therefore, we deconsolidated the mortgage trusts as of March 10, 2010. Deconsolidation resulted in the removal of all trust assets and liabilities from the consolidated balance sheet including $1.5 billion of mortgage loan receivables along with the related allowance of $73 million, debt securities held by third party investors of $1.5 billion, and other net assets of $52 million. It also resulted in the recognition on the consolidated balance sheet of $64 million of interests in the mortgage securitization that continued to be retained after the sale of the interest-only bonds, including mortgage servicing rights, negative amortization bonds, and other interests. The deconsolidation resulted in an increase to non-interest income of $128 million.
The remaining mortgage trusts with $3.0 billion of outstanding mortgage loans and $3.1 billion of securities issued to third parties were not consolidated because we are no longer servicing the mortgage loans and are not considered to be the primary beneficiary of the mortgage trusts. These trusts were not consolidated upon initial adoption because the insurer of the mortgage securitization had the power to remove us as the servicer of the loans prior to the adoption of the new consolidation standards and formally exercised that right during the first quarter of 2010.
GreenPoint Mortgage HELOCs Our discontinued wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint, previously sold home equity lines of credit in whole loan sales and subsequently acquired a residual interest in certain trusts which securitized some of those loans. As the residual interest holder, GreenPoint is required to fund advances on the home equity lines of credit when certain performance triggers are met due to deterioration in asset performance. We have funded $26 million in advances through December 31, 2010, all of which has been expensed as funded.Our unfunded commitment related to these residual interests was $13 million as of December 31, 2010. We did not consolidate the trusts because the residual certificates did not provide the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the trusts.
GreenPoint Mortgage Manufactured Housing We retain the primary obligation for certain provisions of corporate guarantees, recourse sales and clean-up calls related to the discontinued manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit LLC (GPC) which was sold to a third party in 2004. Although we are the primary obligor, recourse obligations related to former GPC whole loan sales, commitments to exercise mandatory clean-up calls on certain GPC securitization transactions and servicing were transferred to a third party in the sale transaction. We do not consolidate the trusts used for the securitization of manufactured housing loans because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts since we no longer service the loans.
130 Table of Contents We were required to fund letters of credit in 2004 to cover losses, and are obligated to fund future amounts under swap agreements for certain transactions. We have the right to receive any funds remaining in the letters of credit after the securities are released. The amount available under the letters of credit was $183 million and $205 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The fair value of the expected residual balances on the funded letters of credit was $35 million and $46 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Our maximum exposure under the swap agreements was $27 million and $33 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The value of our obligations under these swaps was $18 million at both December 31, 2010 and 2009, and is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
The principal balance of manufactured housing securitization transactions where we are the residual interest holder was $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In the event the third party does not fulfill on its obligations to exercise the clean-up calls on certain transactions, the obligation reverts to us and we would assume approximately $420 million of loans receivable upon our execution of the clean-up call with the requirement to absorb any losses on the loans receivable. There have been no instances of non-performance to date by the third party.
Management monitors the underlying assets for trends in delinquencies and related losses and reviews the purchasers financial strength as well as servicing performance. These factors are considered in assessing the adequacy of the liabilities established for these obligations and the valuations of the assets.
Accounts Receivable from Securitizations Retained interests in off-balance sheet securitizations are reported as accounts receivable from securitizations on the consolidated balance sheet and are comprised of interest-only strips, retained tranches, cash collateral accounts, cash reserve accounts and unpaid interest and fees on the investors portion of the transferred principal receivables.
As a result of consolidation of certain trusts, the related interest-only strip and retained tranches were eliminated and the remaining retained interests were reclassified to either loans held for investment, accrued interest receivable or restricted cash for these trusts. The following table provides details of accounts receivable from securitizations as of December 31, 2010 and 2009: December31, 2010 2009 (Dollars in millions) Mortgage (3) Non-Mortgage (2) Mortgage (3) Total Interest-only strip classified as trading $ 75 $ 22 $ 223 $ 245 Retained interests classified as trading: Retained notes 34 573 0 573 Cash collateral 8 138 3 141 Investor accrued interest receivable 0 898 0 898 Total retained interests classified as trading 42 1,609 3 1,612 Retained notes classified as available for sale 0 2,088 0 2,088 Other retained interests 3 0 12 12 Total retained residual interests 120 3,719 238 3,957 Payments due to investors for interest on the notes 0 (61 ) (1 ) (62 ) Collections on deposit for off-balance sheet securitizations (1) 0 3,233 0 3,233 Total accounts receivable from securitizations $ 120 $ 6,891 $ 237 $ 7,128 _____________ (1) Collections on deposit for off-balance sheet securitizations include $2.2 billion of principal collections accumulated for expected maturities of securitization transactions as of December 31, 2009. There were no collections on deposit for off-balance sheet securitizations as of December 31, 2010. Collections on deposit for secured borrowings are included in restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2010 and thereafter .
(2) As of December 31, 2009, non-mortgage related accounts receivable from securitizations includes credit card, installment loan and auto trusts .
(3) The mortgage securitization transactions relate to the Chevy Chase Bank acquisition which occurred on February 27, 2009.
Our retained residual interests are generally restricted or subordinated to investors interests, their value was subject to substantial credit, repayment and interest rate risks. As such, the interest-only strip and retained subordinated interests were classified as trading assets, and changes in the estimated fair value were recorded in servicing and securitization income. Additionally, we retained other tranches in certain of the securitization transactions which are considered to be higher investment grade securities and subject to lower risk of loss. Those retained tranches were classified as available-for-sale securities, and changes in the estimated fair value were recorded in other comprehensive income.
131 Table of Contents We recognized a net loss of $19 million, $161 million and $260 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to changes in the fair value of retained interests.
The table below displays the components of the net loss for each year.
Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 (1) 2009 2008 Interest only strip valuation changes $ (6 ) $ (96 ) $ (225 ) Fair value adjustments related to spread accounts 5 3 (3 ) Fair value adjustments related to investors accrued interest receivable 0 (11 ) 0 Fair value adjustments related to retained subordinated notes (18 ) (57 ) (32 ) Net loss recognized in earnings $ (19 ) $ (161 ) $ (260 ) _____________ (1) 2010 contains both mortgage related amounts representing valuation changes of mortgage interest only strips, spread accounts, and retained interests held at December 31, 2010 and non-mortgage related amounts representing the one installment loan securitization that remained off-balance sheet through September 15, 2010.
The majority of the change in 2010 was due to the elimination or reclassification of retained interests on January 1, 2010 as a result the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards and the subsequent pay down of the off-balance sheet installment loan trust. The changes in the fair value of retained interests in prior periods were primarily driven by rate assumption changes and volume fluctuations. All of these retained residual interests were subject to loss in the event assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value did not prevail, or if borrowers default on the related securitized receivables and our retained subordinated tranches are used to repay investors. See the table below for key assumptions and sensitivities for retained interest valuations.
The gain on sale recorded from off-balance sheet securitizations was based on the estimated fair value of the assets sold and retained and liabilities incurred, and was recorded at the time of sale, net of transaction costs, in servicing and securitizations income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The related receivable was the interest-only strip, which was based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows from excess finance charges and past-due fees over the sum of the return paid to security holders, estimated contractual servicing fees and credit losses. We periodically reviewed the key assumptions and estimates used in determining the value of the interest-only strip and other retained interests. We classified the interest-only strip as a trading asset. We recognized all changes in the fair value of the interest-only strip immediately in servicing and securitizations income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The interest component of cash flows attributable to retained interests in securitizations was recorded in other interest income.
Key Assumptions and Sensitivities for Retained Interest Valuations The key assumptions used in determining the fair value of the interest-only strip and other retained residual interests include the weighted average ranges for net charge-off rates, principal payment rates, lives of receivables and discount rates, all of which are included in the following table. The net charge-off rates were determined using forecasted net charge-offs expected for the trust calculated consistently with our other net charge-off forecasts. The principal repayment rate assumptions were determined using actual and forecast trust principal payment rates based on the collateral. The lives of receivables were determined as the number of months necessary to repay the investors given the principal payment rate assumptions. The discount rates were determined using primarily trust specific statistics and forward rate curves, and were reflective of what market participants would use in a similar valuation. Additionally, accrued interest receivable, cash reserve and spread accounts were discounted over the estimated life of the assets.
If these assumptions are not met, or if they change, the interest-only strip, retained interests and related servicing and securitizations income would be affected. The following adverse changes to the key assumptions and estimates are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the figures indicate, any change in fair value based on a 10% or 20% variation in assumptions cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of a change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the interest-only strip is calculated independently from any change in another assumption. However, changes in one factor may result in changes in other factors, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities.
132 Table of Contents For the periods ending December 31, 2010 and 2009, the assumptions and sensitivities shown below included all credit card and installment loan securitizations.

(2) Does not include liquidity swap related to the negative amortization bonds of $19 million.
Static pool credit losses were calculated by summing the actual and projected future credit losses and dividing them by the original balance of each pool of assets. Due to the short-term revolving nature of the loan receivables, the weighted average percentage of static pool credit losses was not considered materially different from the assumed charge-off rates used to determine the fair value of the retained interests.
We act as a servicing agent and receive contractual servicing fees of between 0.5% and 4% of the investor principal outstanding, based upon the type of assets serviced. For off-balance sheet securitizations, we generally did not record material servicing assets or liabilities for these rights since the contractual servicing fee approximates market rates.
Cash Flows Related to the Off-Balance Sheet Securitizations The following provides the details of the cash flow related to securitization transactions that qualified as off-balance sheet for the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009: December31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Proceeds from new securitizations $ 0 $ 12,068 Collections reinvested in revolving securitizations N/A 70,896 Repurchases of accounts from the trust 0 9 Servicing fees received 14 879 Cash flows received on retained interests (1) 116 5,252 _____________ (1) Includes all cash receipts of excess spread and other payments (excluding servicing fees) from the program. Cash flows in 2009include securitizations that no longer qualify as off-balance sheet. Results for 2010 include the impact from the clean-up call payment for the liquidation of the off-balance sheet installment loan trust.
Supplemental Loan Information The table below displays the unpaid principal balance as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 of off-balance sheet single-family residential loans we serviced.We also display the unpaid principal balance of loans past due 90 days or more and the net credit losses associated with these loans in 2010 and 2009.
133 Table of Contents December31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Total principal amount of loans $ 1,396 $ 4,642 Principal amount of loans past due 90 days or more $ 257 $ 1,247 Net credit losses $ 136 $ 217 Other VIEs Affordable Housing Entities As part of our community reinvestment initiatives, we invest in private investment funds that make equity investments in multi-family affordable housing properties. We receive affordable housing tax credits for these investments. The activities of these entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. As a result of the new consolidation guidance, certain investment funds are no longer considered to be VIEs and are not included in the December 31, 2010 balances. For those investment funds considered to be VIEs, we are not required to consolidate if we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of those entities. We record our interests in these unconsolidated VIEs in loans held for investment, other assets and other liabilities.As of December 31, 2010 and 2009 our interests consisted of assets of approximately $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to our variable interests in the entities and is $1.7 million as of December 31, 2010. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit and we do not provide additional financial or other support during the period that we were not previously contractually required to provide. The total assets of the unconsolidated investment funds that were VIEs at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were approximately $7.5 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively. The remaining investment funds where we have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance were consolidated as of January 1, 2010; the net consolidation impact to retained earnings was $3 million.
Entities that Provide Capital to Low-Income and Rural Communities We hold variable interests in entities (Investor Entities) that invest in community development entities (CDEs) that provide debt financing to businesses and non-profit entities in low-income and rural communities. Investments of the consolidated Investor Entities are also our variable interests. The activities of the Investor Entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. The activities of the CDEs are financed solely with invested equity capital. We receive federal and state tax credits for these investments. We consolidate the VIEs in which we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. The assets of the VIEs that we consolidated at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were approximately $230 million and $155 million, respectively. The assets and liabilities of these consolidated VIEs were recorded in cash, loans held for investment, interest receivable, other assets and other liabilities. The total assets of the VIEs that we held an interest in but were not required to consolidate at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were approximately $7.5 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively. We record our interests in these unconsolidated VIEs in loans held for investment and other assets. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009 our interests consisted of assets of approximately $6 million and $58 million, respectively.Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to our variable interests in the entities and is $6 million as of December 31, 2010.The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support during the period that we were not previously contractually required to provide.
Other We also have a variable interest in a trust that has a royalty interest in certain oil and gas properties. The activities of the trust are financed solely with debt. The total assets of the trust at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $395 million and $430 million, respectively. We are not required to consolidate the trust because we do not have the power to direct the activities of the trust that most significantly impacts the trusts economic performance. We record our interest in the trust in loans held for investment. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009 our interests consisted of assets of approximately $174 million and $203 million, respectively.Our maximum exposure to the trust is limited to our variable interest and is $174 million as of December 31, 2010. The creditors of the trust have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support during the period that we were not previously contractually required to provide.
134 Table of Contents NOTE 8 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS The table below displays the components of goodwill and other intangible assets, including mortgage servicing rights, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009: December31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Goodwill $ 13,591 $ 13,596 Other intangible assets: Core deposit intangibles 650 849 Lease intangibles 26 31 Purchased credit card relationship intangible (1) 42 0 Trust intangibles 6 6 Other intangibles 9 20 Total other intangible assets 733 906 Total goodwill and other intangible assets $ 14,324 $ 14,502 Mortgage servicing rights $ 141 $ 240 _____________ (1) Relates to the acquisition of the legacy Sony Card portfolio in the third quarter of 2010.
Goodwill During the first quarter of 2009, we acquired Chevy Chase Bank, the largest retail branch presence in the Washington, D.C. region, which created $1.6 billion of goodwill. During 2009, we realigned our business segment reporting structure to better reflect the manner in which the performance of our operations is evaluated. We now report the results of our business through three operating segments: Credit Card which consist of Domestic Card and International Card; Consumer Banking which consist of Auto Finance, Home Loans and Other Retail; and Commercial Banking which consist of Commercial and Multifamily Real Estate, Middle Market, Specialty Lending and Small-ticket Commercial Real Estate. As a result of the segment reorganization, goodwill was reassigned to the new reporting units using a relative fair value allocation approach, and the goodwill associated with the Chevy Chase Bank acquisition was assigned to the Commercial Banking and Consumer Banking segments. Prior to the segment reorganization in 2009, goodwill associated with the acquisition was included in the Other category. See Note 2  Acquisitions and Restructuring Activities for information regarding the Chevy Chase Bank acquisition.
In accordance with accounting guidance, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is at the operating segment level or one level below an operating segment. Impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or circumstances change, such as adverse changes in the business climate, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Goodwill is assigned to one or more reporting units at the date of acquisition. Our reporting units are Domestic Card, International Card, Auto Finance, other Consumer BankingandCommercial Banking. The goodwill impairment test, performed at October1 of each year, is a two-step test. The first step identifies whether there is potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the second step of the impairment test is required to measure the amount of any impairment loss.
For the 2010 annual impairment test, the fair value of reporting units was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis, a form of the income approach, using each reporting units internal forecast and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate reflecting the nominal growth rate of the economy as a whole and appropriate discount rates for the respective reporting units. Cash flows were adjusted as necessary in order to maintain each reporting units equity capital requirements. Our discounted cash flow analysis required management to make judgments about future loan and deposit growth, revenue growth, credit losses, and capital rates. The cash flows were discounted to present value using reporting unit specific discount rates that are largely based on our external cost of equity with adjustments for risk inherent in each reporting unit. Discount rates used for the reporting units ranged from 10.0% to 14.6 %. The key inputs into the discounted cash flow analysis were corroborated with market data, where available, indicating that assumptions used were within a reasonable range of observable market data.
Based on the comparison of fair value to carrying amount, as calculated using the methodology summarized above, fair value exceeded the carrying amount for all reporting units as of our annual testing date.Therefore, the goodwill of our reporting units was considered not impaired, and the second step of impairment testing was unnecessary. However, assuming all other factors were held constant, a 34 % decline in the fair value of the Domestic Card reporting unit, a 14 % decline in the fair value of the International Card reporting unit, a 37 % decline in the fair value of the Auto Finance reporting unit,a 21 % decline in the fair value of the other Consumer Bankinganda 30% decline in the fair value of the other Commercial Banking reporting unitreporting unit would have caused the carrying amount for those reporting units to be in excess of fair value which would require the second step to be performed.
135 Table of Contents As part of our annual impairment test, we assessed our market capitalization based on the average market price relative to the aggregate fair value of our reporting units and determined that any excess fair value in our reporting units at that time could be attributed to a reasonable control premium compared to historical control premiums seen in the industry.During 2009, the lack of liquidity in the financial markets and the continued economic deterioration led to a decline in market capitalization resulting in significantly higher control premiums than what had been seen historically.Throughout 2010, our capitalization rate increased resulting in a decline in our implied control premium.We will continue to regularly monitor our market capitalization in 2011, overall economic conditions and other events or circumstances that may result in an impairment of goodwill in the future.

Other Intangible Assets In connection with the acquisition of Chevy Chase Bank, we recorded intangible assets of $278 million that consisted of core deposit intangibles, trust intangibles, lease intangibles, and other intangibles, which are subject to amortization.
The core deposit and trust intangibles reflect the estimated value of deposit and trust relationships. The lease intangibles reflect the difference between the contractual obligation under current lease contracts and the fair market value of the lease contracts at the acquisition date. The purchased credit card relationship reflects the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the credit card loans acquired in the Sony acquisition.The other intangible items relate to customer lists and brokerage relationships.
136 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our intangible assets subject to amortization: December 31, 2010 (Dollars in millions) Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Remaining Amortization Period Core deposit intangibles $ 1,562 $ (912 ) $ 650 7.0 years Lease intangibles 54 (28 ) 26 21.7 years Purchased credit card relationship intangible (1) 47 (5 ) 42 6.1 years Trust intangibles 11 (5 ) 6 12.9 years Other intangibles 35 (26 ) 9 3.3 years Total $ 1,709 $ (976 ) $ 733 December 31, 2009 (Dollars in millions) Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Remaining Amortization Period Core deposit intangibles $ 1,562 $ (713 ) $ 849 8.0 years Lease intangibles 54 (23 ) 31 22.7 years Trust intangibles 11 (5 ) 6 13.9 years Other intangibles 35 (15 ) 20 3.2 years Total $ 1,662 $ (756 ) $ 906 _____________ (1) Relates to the acquisition of the legacy Sony Card portfolio in the third quarter of 2010.
Intangible assets, which are reported in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives on an accelerated basis using the sum of the year's digits methodology.Intangible a mortization expense, which is included in non-interest expense on our consolidated statements of income, totaled $220 million, $235 million and $201 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
The weighted average amortization period for purchase accounting intangibles is 7.4 years as of December 31, 2010.
The following table summarizes the estimated future amortization expense for intangible assets as of December 31, 2010: (Dollars in millions) Estimated Future Amortization Amounts 2011 $ 196 2012 161 2013 130 2014 100 2015 71 Thereafter 75 Total $ 733 Mortgage Servicing Rights MSRs are recognized at fair value when mortgage loans are sold or securitized in the secondary market and the right to service these loans is retained for a fee. MSRs are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded as a component of mortgage servicing and other income. We may enter into derivatives to economically hedge changes in fair value of MSRs. We have no other loss exposure on MSRs in excess of the recorded fair value.
We continue to operate the mortgage servicing business and to report the changes in the fair value of MSRs in continuing operations. To evaluate and measure fair value, the underlying loans are stratified based on certain risk characteristics, including loan type, note rate and investor servicing requirements.
137 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the changes in the fair value of MSRs during the year ended December31, 2010 and 2009: December31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Balance at beginning of period $ 240 $ 151 Acquired in acquisitions (1) 0 110 Originations 12 16 Sales (42 ) 0 Change in fair value, net (69 ) (37 ) Balance at end of period $ 141 $ 240 Ratio of mortgage servicing rights to related loans serviced for others 0.71 % 0.81 % Weighted average service fee $ 0.28 $ 0.29 _____________ (1) Related to the Chevy Chase Bank acquisition completed on February 27, 2009.
MSR fair value adjustments in 2010 and 2009 included decreases of $28 million and $31 million, respectively, due to run-off and cash collections, and decreases of $41 million and $6 million, respectively, due to changes in the valuation inputs and assumptions.
The significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the MSRs as of December31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows: December31, 2010 2009 Weighted average prepayment rate (includes default rate) 14.25 % 17.61 % Weighted average life (in years) 6.07 5.15 Discount rate 10.23 % 11.46 % The decrease in the weighted average prepayment rate and the corresponding increase in weighted average life, were both driven by a reduction in voluntary attrition due to market conditions.
At December 31, 2010, the sensitivities to immediate 10% and 20% increases in the weighted average prepayment rates would decrease the fair value of mortgage servicing rights by $6 million and $12 million, respectively.
At December 31, 2010, the sensitivities to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in servicing costs would decrease the fair value of mortgage servicing rights by $11 million and $23 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2010, our mortgage loan servicing portfolio consisted of mortgage loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $30.8 billion, of which $20.2 billion was serviced for other investors. As of December 31, 2009, our mortgage loan servicing portfolio consisted of mortgage loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $43.0 billion, of which $30.3 billion was serviced for other investors.
NOTE 9PREMISES, EQUIPMENT & LEASE COMMITMENTS Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We capitalize direct costs (including external costs for purchased software, contractors, consultants and internal staff costs) for internally developed software projects that have been identified as being in the application development stage. Depreciation and amortization expenses are computed generally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful lives for premises and equipment are as follows: Premises & Equipment Useful Lives Buildings and improvement 5-39 years Furniture and equipment 3-10 years Computers and software 3-7 years 138 Table of Contents Premises and equipment were as follows: December31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Land $ 562 $ 583 Buildings and improvements 1,948 1,836 Furniture and equipment 1,315 1,237 Computer software 921 922 In process 258 239 5,004 4,817 Less: Accumulated depreciation and amortization (2,255 ) (2,081 ) Total premises and equipment, net $ 2,749 $ 2,736 Depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations was $327 million, $327 million, and $331 million, for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
As discussed in Note 2  Acquisitions and Restructuring Activities, we completed the acquisition of Chevy Chase Bank in February 2009. The acquisition added $159 million in land, $248 million in buildings and improvements, $69 million of furniture and equipment, $42 million of computer software and $11 million of construction in process at December31, 2009, which are reflected in the table above.
Lease Commitments Certain premises and equipment are leased under agreements that expire at various dates through 2056, without taking into consideration available renewal options. Many of these leases provide for payment by the lessee of property taxes, insurance premiums, cost of maintenance and other costs. In some cases, rentals are subject to increases in relation to a cost of living index. Total rent expenses from continuing operations amounted to approximately $191 million, $183 million, and $164 million for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Future minimum rental commitments as of December31, 2010, for all non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more are as follows: (Dollars in millions) Estimated Future Minimum Rental Commitments 2011 $ 159 2012 152 2013 145 2014 135 2015 122 Thereafter 785 Total $ 1,498 Minimum sublease rental income of $28 million due in future years under non-cancelable leases has not been included in the table above as a reduction to minimum lease payments.
NOTE 10DEPOSITS AND BORROWINGS Customer Deposits Our customer deposits, which have become our largest source of funding for our operations and asset growth, consist of non-interest bearing and interest-bearing deposits, including demand deposits, money market deposits, negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit.
As of December31, 2010, we had $107.2 billion in interest-bearing deposits of which $6.5 billion represents large denomination certificates of $100,000 or more. As of December31, 2009, we had $102.4 billion in interest-bearing deposits, of which $8.8 billion represents large denomination certificates of $100,000 or more.
On July26, 2009, we sold our U.K. deposits business. The amount of deposits sold totaled approximately $1.2 billion, and we recorded a minimal loss on the sale.
139 Table of Contents Borrowings We also access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through loan securitization transactions and the issuance of senior and subordinated debt.As of December 31, 2010, we had an effective shelf registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) under which, from time to time, we may offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depository shares representing preferred stock, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants, units, trust preferred securities, junior subordinated debentures, guarantees of trust preferred securities and certain back-up obligations. There is no limit under this shelf registration statement to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell. Under SEC rules, the shelf registration statement, which we filed in May 2009, expires three years after filing. We did not issue anysecurities under the shelf registration statement during 2010.
In addition to issuance capacity under the shelf registration statement, we have access to other borrowing programs, including advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank.Our FHLB membership is secured by our investment in FHLB stock, which totaled $269 million and $264 million, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Securitized Debt Obligations As a result of the January 1, 2010 prospective adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards, we consolidated the substantial majority of our securitization trusts, which significantly increased our securitized debt obligations of the consolidated trusts.Effective January 1, 2010, we added to our consolidated balance sheet $41.9 billion of assets, consisting primarily of credit card loan receivables underlying the consolidated securitization trusts, along with $44.3 billion of related debt issued by these trusts to third-party investors.As of December 31, 2010, we had $79 million in fair value hedging gains related to securitized debt obligations which are disclosed on the consolidated balance sheet in other liabilities.
Senior and Subordinated Debt Under the Senior and Subordinated Global Bank Note Program, COBNA has the ability to issue debt securities to both U.S. and non-U.S. lenders and to raise funds in U.S. and foreign currencies.The Senior and Subordinated Global Bank Note Program had $820 million and $1.3 billion outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.As of December 31, 2010, we had $8.7 billion of senior and subordinated notes outstanding, which included $578 million in fair value hedging losses. As of December 31, 2009, we had $9.0 billion of senior and subordinated notes outstanding, which included $300 million of fair value hedging losses. Two senior notes totaling $671 million matured during the year ended December 31, 2010 .
See Note 11Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for information about our fair value hedging activities.
Junior Subordinated Debentures We had $3.6 billion and $3.7 billion of outstanding junior subordinated debentures as of both December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.There were no junior subordinated borrowings that were called or matured during the year ended December 31, 2010.On August5, 2009, we issued $1.0 billion of 10.25% trust preferred securities, due 2039.On November13, 2009, we issued $1.0 billion of 8.875% trust preferred securities, due 2040.
FHLB Advances We had outstanding FHLB advances, which are secured by our investment securities, residential mortgage loan portfolio, multifamily loans, commercial real-estate loans and home equity lines of credit, totaling $1.1 billion and $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Composition of Customer Deposits, Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt The table below summarizes the components of our deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Our total short-term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings with a remaining contractual maturity of one year or less.Our long-term debt consists of borrowings with a remaining contractual maturity of greater than one year.The amounts presented for outstanding borrowings include unamortized debt premiums and discounts, net of fair value hedge accounting adjustments.

NOTE 11DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Use of Derivatives We manage our asset/liability risk position and exposure to market risk in accordance with prescribed risk management policies and limits established by our Asset Liability Management Committee and approved by our Board of Directors.Our primary market risk stems from the impact on our earnings and our economic value of equity from changes in interest rates, and to a lesser extent, changes in foreign exchange rates.We manage our interest rate sensitivity through several techniques, which include, but are not limited to, changing the maturity and re-pricing characteristics of various balance sheet categories and by entering into interest rate derivatives. Derivatives are also utilized to manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates.Derivative instruments may be privately negotiated contracts, which are often referred to as over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, or they may be listed and traded on an exchange. We execute our derivative contracts in both the OTC and exchange-traded derivative markets.In addition to interest rate swaps, we use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk.From time to time, we enter into customer-accommodation derivative transactions. We engage in these transactions as a service to our commercial banking customers to facilitate their risk management objectives.We typically offset the market risk exposure to our customer-accommodation derivatives through derivative transactions with other counterparties.
142 Table of Contents Accounting for Derivatives We account for derivatives pursuant to the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging.The outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts totaled $50.8 billion and $59.2 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We previously entered into interest rate swaps with one of the securitization trusts and essentially offset the derivatives with separate interest rate swaps with third parties. Upon consolidation of the trusts on January 1, 2010, the interest rate swap agreements between the Company and the trust are considered intercompany agreements, with a notional value of approximately $6.5 billion as of December 31, 2009, and any related receivables and payables are eliminated in consolidation, leading to the reduction in notional balance seen in the period.The notional amount provides an indication of the volume of our derivatives activity and is used as the basis on which interest and other payments are determined; however, it is generally not the amount exchanged.Derivatives are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets.The fair value of a derivative represents our estimate of the amount at which a derivative could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between market participants.We report derivatives in a gain position, or derivative assets, in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets.We report derivatives in a loss position, or derivative liabilities, in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities.Our policy is to report derivative asset and liability amounts on a gross basis based on individual contracts, which does not take into consideration the effects of master counterparty netting agreements or collateral netting.The fair value of derivative assets and derivative liabilities reported in our consolidated balance sheet was $1.3 billion and $636 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2010, compared with $1.1 billion and $407 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2009.
Our derivatives are designated as either qualifying accounting hedges or free-standing derivatives.Free-standing derivatives consist of customer-accommodation derivatives and economic hedges that we enter into for risk management purposes that are not linked to specific assets or liabilities or to forecasted transactions and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting.Qualifying accounting hedges are designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives as fair value hedges to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, which fluctuate in value as a result of movements in interest rates. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings together with offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item and any resulting ineffectiveness.Our fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps that are intended to modify our exposure to interest rate risk on various fixed-rate senior notes, subordinated notes, brokered certificates of deposits and U.S. agency investments. These hedges have maturities through 2019 and have the effect of converting some of our fixed-rate debt, deposits and investments to variable rate.
Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of AOCI, to the extent that the hedge relationships are effective, and amounts are reclassified from AOCI to earnings as the forecasted transactions occur. To the extent that any ineffectiveness exists in the hedge relationships, the amounts are recorded in current period earnings. Our cash flow hedges consist of interest rate swaps that are intended to hedge the variability in interest payments on some of our variable-rate debt issuances and assets through 2017.These hedges have the effect of converting some of our variable-rate debt and assets to a fixed rate. We also have entered into forward foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to foreign-currency denominated debt.These hedges are used to hedge foreign exchange exposure on foreign-currency denominated debt by converting the funding currency to the same currency as the assets being financed.
Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment hedges, primarily forward foreign exchange contracts, to manage the exposure related to our net investments in consolidated foreign operations that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar.Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recorded in the translation adjustment component of AOCI.
Free-Standing Derivatives: We use free-standing derivatives, or economic hedges, to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of residential MSRs, mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments and other interests held.We also categorize our customer-accommodation derivatives and the related offsetting contracts as free-standing derivatives.Changes in the fair value of free-standing derivatives are recorded in earnings as a component of servicing and securitizations income or as a component of other non-interest income.
143 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Presentation The following table summarizes the fair value and related outstanding notional amounts of derivative instruments reported in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The fair value amounts are segregated by derivatives that are designated as accounting hedges and those that are not, and are further segregated by type of contract within those two categories.

Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges The table below shows the net gains (losses) related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for 2010 and 2009.
Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Gain (loss) recorded in AOCI : (1) Cash flow hedges: Interest rate contracts $ 83 $ 175 Foreign exchange contracts (1 ) 11 Subtotal 82 186 Net investment hedges: Foreign exchange contracts 0 (7) Net derivatives gain recognized in AOCI $ 82 $ 179 Gain (loss) recorded in earnings: Cash flow hedges: Gain (loss) reclassified from AOCI into earnings: Interest rate contracts (2) $ (74 ) $ (89 ) Foreign exchange contracts (3) 0 (3 ) Subtotal (74 ) (92 ) Gain (loss) recognized in earnings due to ineffectiveness: Interest rate contracts (3) 1 (1 ) Foreign exchange contracts (3) 0 0 Subtotal 1 (1 ) Net investment hedges: Gain (loss) reclassified from AOCI into earnings: (1) Foreign exchange contracts 0 0 Net derivatives loss recognized in earnings $ (73 ) $ (93 ) ______________ (1) Amounts represent the effective portion.
(2) Amounts reclassified are recorded in our consolidated statements of income in interest income or interest expense.
(3) Amounts reclassified are recorded in our consolidated statements of income in other non-interest income.
145 Table of Contents We expect to reclassify net after-tax gains of $2 million recorded in AOCI as of December 31, 2010, related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges to earnings over the next 12 months, which we expect to offset against the cash flows associated with the hedged forecasted transactions.The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions were hedged was 7 years as of December 31, 2010.The amount we expect to reclassify into earnings may change as a result of changes in market conditions and ongoing actions taken as part of our overall risk management strategy.
Credit Default Swaps We have credit exposure on credit default swap agreements that we entered into to manage our risk of loss on certain manufactured housing securitizations issued by GreenPoint Credit LLC in 2000. Our maximum credit exposure related to these swap agreements totaled $27 million and $33 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.These agreements are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities.The value of our obligations under these swaps was $18 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.See Note 7Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations for additional information about our manufactured housing securitization transactions.
Credit Risk-Related Contingency Features Certain of our derivative contracts include provisions requiring that our debt maintain a credit rating of investment grade or above by each of the major credit rating agencies.In the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade, some of our derivative counterparties would have the right to terminate the derivative contract and close-out the existing positions.Other derivative contracts include provisions that would, in the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade, allow our derivative counterparties to demand immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization on derivative instruments in a net liability position. Certain of our derivative contracts may allow, in the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating of any kind, our derivative counterparties to demand additional collateralization on such derivative instruments in a net liability position. The fair value of derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in a net liability position was $66 million and $117 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We were required to post collateral, consisting of a combination of cash and securities, totaling $229 million and $254 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.If our debt credit rating had fallen below investment grade, we would have been required to post additional collateral of $39 million and $28 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Derivative Counterparty Credit Risk Derivative instruments contain an element of credit risk that arises from the potential failure of a counterparty to perform according to the contractual terms of the contract.Our exposure to derivative counterparty credit risk at any point in time is represented by the fair value of derivatives in a gain position, or derivative assets, assuming no recoveries of underlying collateral.To mitigate the risk of counterparty default, we maintain collateral agreements with certain derivative counterparties.These agreements typically require both parties to maintain collateral in the event the fair values of derivative financial instruments exceed established thresholds. We received cash collateral from derivatives counterparties totaling $668 million and $338 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.We posted cash collateral in accounts maintained by derivatives counterparties totaling $229 million and $254 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
We record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on our derivative assets to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparty.We consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining the counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment, which may be adjusted in future periods due to changes in the fair value of the derivative contract, collateral and creditworthiness of the counterparty.The cumulative counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in the derivative asset balance was $22 million and $5 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.We also adjust the fair value of our derivative liabilities to reflect the impact of our credit quality.We calculate this adjustment by comparing the spreads on our credit default swaps to the discount benchmark curve.The cumulative credit risk valuation adjustment related to our credit quality recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as reduction in the derivative liability balance was $2 million and $1 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
146 Table of Contents NOTE 12STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Preferred Shares On November14, 2008, we entered into an agreement (the Securities Purchase Agreement) to issue 3,555,199 Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Shares, Series A, par value $0.01 per share (the Series A Preferred Stock), to the United States Department of the Treasury (U.S. Treasury) as part of our participation in the Capital Purchase Program (the CPP) , having a liquidation amount per share equal to $1,000. The Series A Preferred Stock paid cumulative dividend at a rate of 5%per year for the first five years and thereafter at a rate of 9%per year. In addition, we issued a warrant (the Warrants) to purchase 12,657,960 of our common shares to the U.S. Treasury as part of the Securities Purchase Agreement. The Warrants have an exercise price of $42.13 per share and expires ten years from the issuance date.
In 2009, we repurchased all 3,555,199 preferred shares at par, under theCPP for approximately $3.6 billion including accrued dividends. With the repurchase, the remaining accretion of the discount of $462 million was accelerated and treated as dividend which reduced income available to common stockholders. On December9, 2009, the Warrants were sold by the U.S. Treasury for $11.75 per warrant. The sale by the U.S. Treasury had no impact on our equity and the warrants remain outstanding and are included in paid in capital.
Common Shares Secondary Equity Offering On May11, 2009, we raised $1.5 billion through the issuance of 56,000,000 shares of common stock at $27.75 per share.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) The following table presents the cumulative balances of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred tax of $143 million, $67 million, and $522 million as of December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively: Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net unrealized gains (losses) on securities (1) $ 333 $ 199 $ (797 ) Net unrecognized elements of defined benefit plans (29 ) (29 ) (42 ) Foreign currency translation adjustments (36 ) (26 ) (228 ) Unrealized losses on cash flow hedging instruments (52 ) (60 ) (154 ) Other-than-temporary impairment not recognized in earnings on securities 49 0 0 Initial application of measurement date provisions for postretirement benefits other than pensions (1 ) (1 ) (1 ) Initial application from adoption of consolidation standards (16 ) 0 0 Total accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ 248 $ 83 $ (1,222 ) _____________ (1) Includes net unrealized gains (losses) on securities available for sale and retained subordinated notes. Unrealized losses not related to credit on other-than-temporarily impaired securities of $105 million (net of income tax of $68 million) and $181 million (net of income tax of $117 million) was reported in other comprehensive income as of December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
NOTE 13REGULATORY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY Regulation and Capital Adequacy Bank holding companies and national banks are subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively.The capital adequacy standards set forth minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements that are based on quantitative and qualitative measures of their assets and off-balance sheet items.Under the capital adequacy standards, bank holding companies and banks currently are required to maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4%, and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 4% (3% for banks that meet certain specified criteria, including excellent asset quality, high liquidity, low interest rate exposure and the highest regulatory rating).
147 Table of Contents Under prompt corrective action capital regulations, a bank is considered to be well capitalized if it maintains a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% (200 basis points higher than the above minimum capital standard), a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6%, a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 5% and not be subject to any supervisory agreement, order, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital reserve. A bank is considered to be adequately capitalized if it meets the above minimum capital ratios and does not otherwise meet the well capitalized definition.Currently, prompt corrective action capital requirements do not apply to bank holding companies. We are also subject to minimum cash reserve requirements by the Federal Reserve totaling approximately $915 million as of December31, 2010.
The table below provides a comparison of our capital ratios as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.As of December 31, 2010, we exceeded minimum capital requirements and would meet the well-capitalized ratio levels specified under prompt corrective action for total risk-based capital and Tier 1 risk-based capital under Federal Reserve capital standards for bank holding companies. As of December 31, 2010, the Banks also exceeded minimum regulatory requirements under the OCCs applicable capital adequacy guidelines and were well-capitalized under prompt corrective action requirements.

Accordingly, we no longer disclose these ratios.
(2) The regulatory framework for prompt corrective action does not apply to Capital One Financial Corp. because it is a bank holding company.
(3) Calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets.
(4) Calculated based on Total risk-based capital divided by risk-weighted assets.
(5) Calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets, after certain adjustments.
Regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the Banks to transfer funds to us.As of December 31, 2010, funds available for dividend payments from the Banks were $1.4 billion and zero, respectively.Although funds are available for dividend payments from COBNA, we would execute a dividend from COBNA in consultation with the OCC.Additionally, a dividend payment by CONA would require prior approval of the OCC.Applicable provisions that may be contained in our borrowing agreements or the borrowing agreements of our subsidiaries may limit our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to us or our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends.
The January 1, 2010 adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards resulted in our consolidating a substantial portion of our securitization trusts and establishing an allowance for loan and lease losses for the assets underlying these trusts, which reduced retained earnings and our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio. In January 2010, banking regulators issued regulatory capital rules related to the impact of the new consolidation accounting standards. Under these rules,we arerequired to hold additional capital for the assets we consolidated. The capital rules also provided for an optional phase-in of the impact from the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards, including a two-quarter implementation delay followed by a two-quarter partial implementation of the effect on regulatory capital ratios.
We elected the phase-in option, which required us to phase-in 50% of consolidated assets beginning with the third quarter of 2010 for purposes of determining risk-weighted assets.However, the phase-in impact was effectively accelerated over the first three quarters of 2010 due to pay downs of outstanding securitization debt. The phase-in provisions expired after December 31, 2010, and the full impact of the consolidated assets on our capital ratios will be realized in the first quarter of 2011.

NOTE 15OTHER NON-INTEREST EXPENSE The following table represents the components of non-interest expense for 2010, 2009 and 2008: Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Professional services $ 916 $ 796 $ 806 Collections 596 599 569 Fraud losses 80 86 106 Bankcard association assessments 221 215 195 Core deposit intangible amortization 203 216 191 Other 667 629 1,102 Total $ 2,683 $ 2,541 $ 2,969 149 Table of Contents NOTE 16STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLAN Stock Plans We have one active stock-based employee compensation plan. Under the plan, we reserve common shares for issuance in various forms including incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and performance share units.
The following table provides the number of reserved common shares and the number of common shares available for future issuance for our active stock-based compensation plan as of December31, 2010 and 2009. The ability to issue grants from the 1999 Non-Employee Directors Stock Incentive Plan was terminated in 2009.
Available For Issuance (In thousands) December 31 Plan Name Shares Reserved 2010 2009 2008 2004 Stock Incentive Plan 40,000 (1) 16,225 17,789 4,506 _____________ (1) On April20, 2009 the Board authorized an increase in shares reserved of 20million shares to 40million shares in total.
Generally the exercise price of stock options, or value of restricted stock awards, will equal the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The maximum contractual term for options is ten years, and option vesting is determined at the time of grant. The vesting for most options is 33 1/3 percent per year beginning with the first anniversary of the grant date. For restricted stock granted before 2010, the vesting was usually 25 percent on the first and second anniversaries of the grant date and 50 percent on the third anniversary date.For restricted stock granted in 2010, the vesting is usually 33 1/3 percent per year beginning with the first anniversary of the grant date.
We also issue cash equity units which are recorded as liabilities as the expense is recognized. Cash equity units are settled with a cash payment for each unit vested equal to the average fair market value of our common stock for the 20 trading days preceding the vesting date. Because they are settled in cash with no opportunity for any shares to be issued at vesting or settlement, cash equity units are not included in shares reserved or available for issuance.For cash equity units granted before 2010, the vesting was usually 25 percent on the first and second anniversaries of the grant date and 50 percent on the third anniversary date. For cash equity units granted in 2010, vesting will usually be 33 1/3 percent per year beginning with the first anniversary of the grant date.
We recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the entire awards vesting period for any awards with graded vesting attributes. Total compensation expense recognized for stock-based compensation during the years 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $149 million, $146 million and $112 million, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of income for stock-based compensation arrangements during the years 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $52 million, $51 million and $39 million, respectively.
Stock option expense is based on the fair value per stock option, estimated at the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of stock options granted during 2010, 2009 and 2008 was estimated using the weighted average assumptions summarized below: Year Ended December 31, Assumptions 2010 2009 2008 Dividend yield (1) 1.49 % 4.79 % 3.20 % Volatility factors of stocks expected market price 38 43 28 Risk-free interest rate 2.49 1.79 2.89 Expected option lives (in years) 5.0 5.0 5.0 _____________ (1) In 2010, 2009, and 2008, we paid dividends at the annual rate of $0.20, $0.53, and $1.50 per share, respectively .

The weighted-average fair value of options granted during the years 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $11.78, $4.56 and $9.94, respectively. Cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were $13 million, $9 million, and $71 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock options were $4 million, $1 million and $9 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The total fair value of restricted stock vesting was $62 million, $41 million and $34 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.We expect to recognize the unrecognized compensation cost for unvested restricted awards of $50 million as of December31, 2010 over the next three years.
Cash equity units vesting in2010, 2009, and 2008 resulted in cash payments to associates of $48 million, $10 million, and $30 million, respectively.These cash payments reflect the number of units vesting based on our stock price as of or for some defined period prior to the vest date.We expect to recognize the unrecognized compensation cost for unvested cash equity units of $54 million as of December31, 2010, which calculated based on the average quarterly stock price, over the next 3 years.

Accelerated Vesting Option Grants Associate Stock Purchase Plan We maintain an Associate Stock Purchase Plan (the Purchase Plan) which is a compensatory plan under the accounting guidance for stock-based compensation.We recognized $4 million in compensation expense for each of the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 under the Purchase Plan.
Under the Purchase Plan, our associates are eligible to purchase common stock through monthly salary deductions of a maximum of 15% and a minimum of 1% of monthly base pay. To date, the amounts deducted are applied to the purchase of our unissued common or treasury stock at 85% of the current market price. Shares may also be acquired on the market. An aggregate of 8.0million shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance under the 2002 Associate Stock Purchase Plan, of which 2.6million and 3.4 million shares were available for issuance as of December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan In 2002, we implemented our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (2002 DRP), which allows participating stockholders to purchase additional shares of our common stock through automatic reinvestment of dividends or optional cash investments.

152 Table of Contents NOTE 17EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Retirement Plans Defined Contribution Plan We sponsor a contributory Associate Savings Plan (the Plan) in which substantially all full-time and certain part-time associates are eligible to participate. We make contributions to each eligible associates account, match a portion of associate contributions and make discretionary contributions based upon our meeting a certain earnings per share target or other performance metrics.In June 2010, we announced that we were implementing a new company contribution structure and several administrative enhancements to the Plan that were effective July 1, 2010. The new contribution structure provides a company contribution through a combination of basic and matching company contributions. We transitioned to the new contribution structure on July 1, 2010, as such, any of our discretionary contribution payout for 2010 was prorated for the period January 1, 2010 to June 30, 2010.Our contributions to this plan amounted to $118 million, $79 million and $110 million for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Effective December 31, 2009, the Hibernia Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan (Hibernia ESOP) was merged into the Plan, and the Hibernia ESOP net assets of $34 million as of December 31, 2009 were transferred into the Plan.As a result, we had no contributions of cash or shares of our common stock to this plan in 2010 or 2009. We recognized compensation expense of $4 million in 2008 related to the ESOP.
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans We sponsor defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. Pension plans include a legacy frozen cash balance plan and plans assumed in the North Fork acquisition, including two qualified defined benefit pension plans and several non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. Our legacy pension plan and the two qualified pension plans from the North Fork acquisition were merged into a single plan effective December31, 2007. Other postretirement benefit plans, including a legacy plan and plans assumed in the Hibernia and North Fork acquisitions, all of which provide medical and life insurance benefits, which were merged into a single plan effective January1, 2008.
Our pension plans and the other postretirement benefit plans are valued using a December31 measurement date.Our policy is to amortize prior service amounts on a straight-line basis over the average remaining years of service to full eligibility for benefits of active plan participants.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, consideration was given to the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets assumption for the portfolio.
155 Table of Contents Assumed health care trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: Year ended December 31, 2010 2009 1%Increase 1%Decrease 1%Increase 1%Decrease Effect on year-end postretirement benefit obligation $ 6 $ (5 ) $ 6 $ (5 ) Effect on total service and interest cost components 0 0 1 (1 ) Plan Assets The qualified defined benefit pension plan asset allocations as of the annual measurement dates are as follows: December 31, 2010 2009 Common collective trusts (1) 73.9 % 69.4 % Money market fund 3.2 30.1 Limited partnerships 0.0 0.5 Corporate bonds (S&P rating of A or higher) 0.8 0.0 Corporate bonds (S&P rating of lower than A) 1.7 0.0 Government securities 20.1 0.0 Mortgage backed securities 0.3 0.0 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % _____________ (1) Common collective trusts include domestic and international equity securities.
The investment guidelines provide the following asset allocation targets and ranges: domestic equity target of 50% and allowable range of 45% to 55%, international equity target of 20% and allowable range of 15% to 25%, and fixed income securities target of 30% and allowable range of 25% to 40%.
Plan assets are invested using a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equity securities and debt securities are used to preserve asset values, diversify risk and enhance our ability to achieve our long-term investment return benchmark. Investment strategies and asset allocations are based on careful consideration of plan liabilities, the plans funded status and our financial condition. Investment performance and asset allocation are measured and monitored on a quarterly basis.
Plan assets are managed in a balanced portfolio comprised of three major components: a domestic equity portion, an international equity portion and a domestic fixed income portion. The expected role of plan equity investments is to maximize the long-term real growth of fund assets, while the role of fixed income investments is to generate current income, provide for more stable periodic returns and provide some protection against a prolonged decline in the market value of fund equity investments.
Fair Values Measurement For information on fair value measurements, including descriptions of Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation methods we utilize, see Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 19Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

NOTE 18INCOME TAXES We account for income taxes in accordance with the accounting guidance prescribed by the FASB, recognizing the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements using the provisions of enacted tax laws. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
Significant components of the provision for income taxes attributable to continuing operations were as follows: Year Ended December31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Current income tax provision: Federal taxes $ (152 ) $ 278 $ 1,069 State taxes 31 35 53 International taxes 122 22 32 Total current provision $ 1 $ 335 $ 1,154 Deferred income tax provision: Federal taxes $ 1,121 $ 9 $ (644 ) State taxes 87 (6 ) (3 ) International taxes 71 11 (10 ) Total deferred provision (benefit) $ 1,279 $ 14 $ (657 ) Total income tax provision $ 1,280 $ 349 $ 497 158 Table of Contents Income tax benefits of $2 million, $793 million and $32 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were allocated directly to reduce goodwill from acquisitions.
Income tax provision (benefit) reported in stockholders equity was as follows: Year Ended December31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Foreign currency translation gains (losses) $ 6 $ (9 ) $ 7 Net unrealized securities gains (losses) 48 521 (421 ) Other-than-temporary impairment on securities 27 0 0 Net unrealized derivative gains 5 61 28 Adoption of new consolidation accounting standards (1,642 ) 0 0 Employee stock plans 10 16 11 Employee retirement plans 0 7 (55 ) Total income tax provision (benefit) $ (1,546 ) $ 596 $ (430 ) The reconciliation of income tax attributable to continuing operations, computed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, to income tax expense was: YearEndedDecember31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Income tax at U.S. federal statutory tax rate 35.00 % 35.00 % 35.00 % State taxes, net of federal benefit 1.28 2.40 3.45 Resolution of federal income tax issues and audits (2.54 ) (4.63 ) 0 Other foreign tax differences, net (0.54 ) (0.20 ) 1.97 Goodwill impairment 0 0 47.67 Other, including nontaxable income and general business tax credits (3.64 ) (6.41 ) (2.62 ) Income taxes 29.56 % 26.16 % 85.47 % During 2010, 2009 and 2008, our income tax expense was reduced by $110 million, $62 million and zero, respectively, due to the resolution of certain tax issues and audits for prior years with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This reduction represented the release of previous accruals for potential audit and litigation adjustments which were subsequently settled or eliminated and further refinement of existing tax exposures.
Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows: December31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Deferred tax assets: Allowance for loan and lease losses $ 1,950 $ 1,496 Unearned income 85 206 Net unrealized losses on securities and derivative instruments 0 0 Employee stock plans 162 147 Rewards& sweepstakes programs 525 473 Valuation difference of acquired loans 503 690 Representation & warranty reserve 302 86 Employee benefits 119 123 Securitizations 13 91 Foreign tax credit carryforward 87 131 Other foreign deferred taxes 50 0 Other assets 287 378 Subtotal 4,083 3,821 Valuation allowance (130 ) (109 ) Total deferred tax assets 3,953 3,712 Deferred tax liabilities: 159 Table of Contents December31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Original issue discount 574 715 Property& equipment 66 39 Prepaid expenses 13 9 Leasing activities 46 23 Core deposit and other intangibles 348 406 Servicing assets 48 83 Net unrealized gains on securities and derivative instruments 36 32 Other foreign deferred taxes 0 39 Other liabilities 107 90 Total deferred tax liabilities 1,238 1,436 Net deferred tax assets $ 2,715 $ 2,276 We have state net operating loss carryforwards with a tax value of $143 million that expire from 2011 to 2030.We have foreign tax credit carryforwards of $87 million that expire in 2014 through 2018.
The valuation allowance was increased by $21 million to adjust the tax benefit of certain state deferred tax assets and net operating loss carryforwards to the amount that we have determined is more likely than not to be realized.
The deferred tax liability for original issue discount represents interchange, late fees, cash advance fees and overlimit fees. These items are generally treated as original issue discount (OID) for tax purposes and recognized over the life of the related credit card receivables. These items are recognized in the income statement as income in the year earned. For income statement purposes, late fees are reported as interest income, and interchange, cash advance fees and overlimit fees are reported as non-interest income.
December31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Original Issue discount: OIDlate fees $ 387 $ 512 OIDall other 1,192 1,461 Gross original issue discount 1,579 1,973 Net deferred tax liability $ 574 $ 715 The accounting guidance for income taxes clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The guidance also provides rules on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.
We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, $(62) million, $(7) million and $30million, respectively, of net interest and penalties was included in income tax expense. The accrued balance of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits is presented in the table below.
160 Table of Contents A reconciliation of the change in unrecognized tax benefits from January1, 2009 to December31, 2010 is as follows: (Dollars in millions) Gross Unrecognized Tax Benefits Accrued Interestand Penalties Gross Tax, Interestand Penalties Balance at January1, 2009 $ 561 $ 176 $ 737 Additions for tax positions related to the current year 8 0 8 Additions for tax positions related to prior years 43 35 78 Reductions for tax positions related to prior years due to IRS and other settlements (255 ) (110 ) (365 ) Additions for tax positions related to acquired entities in prior years, offset to goodwill 7 1 8 Other reductions for tax positions related to prior years (5 ) (2 ) (7 ) Balance at December31, 2009 359 100 459 Additions for tax positions related to the current year 0 0 0 Additions for tax positions related to prior years 0 8 8 Reductions for tax positions related to prior years due to IRS and other settlements (72 ) (43 ) (115 ) Additions for tax positions related to acquired entities in prior years, offset to goodwill 0 0 0 Other reductions for tax positions related to prior years (2 ) 0 (2 ) Balance at December31, 2010 $ 285 $ 65 $ 350 Portion of balance at December31, 2010 that, if recognized, would impact the effective income tax rate $ 108 $ 42 $ 150 We are subject to examination by the IRS and other tax authorities in certain countries and states in which we have significant business operations. The tax years subject to examination vary by jurisdiction. The IRS is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the years 2007 and 2008.During 2009, we made cash payments to the IRS related to concluded examinations for 2005 and 2006, which resulted in a reduction of approximately $195 million in the balance of net unrecognized tax benefits. During 2010, no payments were made to the IRS to reduce the balance of net unrecognized tax benefits.
On April 9, 2010, the U.S. Tax Court entered a decision in our pending case with respect to certain tax issues for the years 1995 to 1999, with both parties prevailing on certain issues. On July 6, 2010, we appealed two issues to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. The IRS prevailed on these issues in the Tax Court. The IRS did not appeal the two issues for which the Tax Court ruled in our favor and the Tax Courts decision on those issues is final. As a result of the non-appeal by the IRS, we reduced the amount of unrecognized tax benefits with respect to these issues by approximately $56 million. With respect to the issues still pending on appeal, the ultimate outcome remains uncertain and may also impact tax years after 1999. It is reasonably possible that a settlement related to these timing issues may be made within twelve months of the reporting date. At this time, an estimate of the potential change to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits resulting from such a settlement cannot be made.
As of December31, 2010, U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $633 million of unremitted earnings of our subsidiaries operating outside the U.S., in accordance with the guidance for accounting for income taxes in special areas. These earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely. Upon repatriation of these earnings, we could be subject to both U.S. income taxes (subject to possible adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability and foreign withholding tax on these unremitted earnings is not practicable at this time because such liability is dependent upon circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.
As of December31, 2010, U.S. income taxes have not been provided for approximately $287 million of previously acquired thrift bad debt reserves created for tax purposes as of December31, 1987. These amounts, acquired as a result of the merger with North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. and the acquisition of Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B., are subject to recapture in the unlikely event that CONA, as successor to North Fork Bank and Chevy Chase Bank F.S.B., makes distributions in excess of earnings and profits, redeems its stock, or liquidates.
NOTE 19FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Under applicable accounting guidance, fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We determine the fair values of our financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established under applicable accounting guidance which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. We did not make any material fair value option elections as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. For a detailed discussion regarding the fair value hierarchy and how we measures fair value, see Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
161 Table of Contents Level 1, 2 and 3 Valuation Techniques Financial instruments are considered Level 1 when the valuation can be based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 financial instruments are valued using quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or models using inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data of substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Financial instruments are considered Level 3 when their values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques, and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable and when determination of the fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.
The following table displays our assets and liabilities measured on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2010 and 2009: Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis December 31, 2010 Fair Value Measurements Using Assets/ Liabilities (Dollars in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 at Fair Value Assets Securities available for sale: U.S. Treasury and other U.S. Agency $ 386 $ 314 $ 0 $ 700 Collateralized mortgage obligations 0 13,277 308 13,585 Mortgage-backed securities 0 16,394 270 16,664 Asset-backed securities 0 9,953 13 9,966 Other 293 322 7 622 Total securities available for sale 679 40,260 598 41,537 Other assets: Mortgage servicing rights 0 0 141 141 Derivative receivables (1) (2) 8 1,265 46 1,319 Retained interests in securitization 0 0 117 117 Total Assets $ 687 $ 41,525 $ 902 $ 43,114 Liabilities Other liabilities: Derivative payables (1) $ (18 ) $ (575 ) $ (43 ) $ (636 ) Total Liabilities $ (18 ) $ (575 ) $ (43 ) $ (636 ) 162 Table of Contents December 31, 2009 Fair Value Measurements Using Assets/ Liabilities (Dollars in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 at Fair Value Assets Securities available for sale: U.S. Treasury and other U.S. Agency $ 392 $ 477 $ 0 $ 869 Collateralized mortgage obligations 0 8,656 982 9,638 Mortgage-backed securities 0 20,198 486 20,684 Asset-backed securities 0 7,179 13 7,192 Other 73 349 25 447 Total securities available for sale 465 36,859 1,506 38,830 Other assets: Mortgage servicing rights 0 0 240 240 Derivative receivables (1)(2) 4 625 440 1,069 Retained interests in securitizations 0 0 3,945 3,945 Total Assets $ 469 $ 37,484 $ 6,131 $ 44,084 Liabilities Other liabilities: Derivative payables (1) (2) $ 8 $ 366 $ 33 $ 407 Total Liabilities $ 8 $ 366 $ 33 $ 407 ___________ (1) We do not offset the fair value of derivative contracts in a loss position against the fair value of contracts in a gain position.We also do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement.
(2) D oes not reflect $20 million and $4 million recognized as a net valuation allowance on derivative assets and liabilities for non-performance risk as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Non-performance risk is reflected in other assets/liabilities on the balance sheet and offset through the income statement in other income .
The determination of the classification of financial instruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy is performed at the end of each reporting period. We consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs. Based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the Level 3 inputs to the instruments fair value measurement in its entirety. If Level 3 inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. The process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions.
During 2010, we had minimal movements between Levels 1 and 2. In connection with the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards on January 1, 2010, retained interests in securitizations, which were considered a Level 3 security, were reclassified to loans held for investment when the underlying trusts were consolidated.
Level 3 Instruments Only Financial instruments are considered Level 3 when their values are determined using pricing models, which include comparison of prices from multiple sources, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable or there is significant variability among pricing sources. Level 3 financial instruments also include those for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. The table below presents a reconciliation for all assets and liabilities measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).

(2) An end of quarter convention is used to measure derivative activity, resulting in end of quarter values being reflected as purchases, issuances and settlements for derivatives having a zero fair value at inception. Gains (losses) related to Level 3 derivative receivables and derivative payables are reported in other non-interest income, which is a component of non-interest income.
(3) An end of quarter convention is used to reflect activity in retained interests in securitizations, resulting in all transactions and assumption changes being reflected as if they occurred on the last day of the quarter. Gains (losses) related to Level 3 retained interests in securitizations are reported in servicing and securitizations income, which is a component of non-interest income.
(4) Thetransfer out of Level 3 for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily driven by greater consistency amongst multiple pricing sources. The transfer into Level 3 were primarily driven by less consistency amongst vendor pricing on individual securities for non-agency MBS .
(5) The amount presented for unrealized gains (loss) for assets still held as of the reporting date primarily represents impairments for available-for-sale securities and accretion on certain fixed maturity securities, and are reported in total other-than-temporary losses as a component of non-interest income.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis We are required to measure and recognize certain other financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the consolidated balance sheet. These financial assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when we evaluate impairment).Fair value adjustments for loans held for sale, foreclosed assets, and other assets are recorded in other non-interest expense, and fair value adjustments for loans held for investment are recorded in provision for loan and lease losses in the consolidated statement of income.
165 Table of Contents For assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and still held on the consolidated balance sheet, the following table provides the fair value measures by level of valuation assumptions used and the gains or losses recognized for these assets as a result of fair value measurements.

The following describes the valuation techniques used in estimating the fair value of our financial instruments as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. We applied the fair value provisions , to the financial instruments not recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, which include loans held for investment, interest receivable, non-interest bearing and interest bearing deposits, other borrowings, senior and subordinated notes, and interest payable. The provisions requiring us to maximize the use of observable inputs and to measure fair value using a notion of exit price were factored into our selection of inputs of our established valuation techniques.
Financial Assets Cash and Cash Equivalents The carrying amounts of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and resale agreements and interest-bearing deposits at other banks approximate fair value.
Restricted Cash or Securitization Investors The carrying amounts of restricted cash for securitization investors approximate their fair value due to their relatively short-term nature.
Securities Held To Maturity The carrying amounts of securities held to maturity, which consists of negative amortization bonds, approximate fair value. We recorded these securities at fair value on the date of acquisition. Fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow method, a form of the income approach. Discount rates were determined considering market rates at which similar instruments would be sold to third parties.
Securities Available For Sale Quoted prices in active markets are used to measure the fair value of U.S. Treasury securities. For other investment categories, we utilize multiple third party pricing services to obtain fair value measures for the large majority of our securities. A pricing service may be considered as the primary pricing provider for certain types of securities, and the designation of the primary pricing provider may vary depending on the type of securities. The determination of the primary pricing provider is based on our experience and validation benchmark of the pricing services performance in terms of providing fair value measurement for the various types of securities.
167 Table of Contents Certain securities available for sale are classified as Level 2 and 3, the majority of which are collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed securities. Classification indicates that significant valuation assumptions are not consistently observable in the market. When significant assumptions are not consistently observable, fair values are derived using the best available data. Such data may include quotes provided by a dealer, the use of external pricing services, independent pricing models, or other model-based valuation techniques such as calculation of the present values of future cash flows incorporating assumptions such as benchmark yields, spreads, prepayment speeds, credit ratings, and losses. The techniques used by the pricing services utilize observable market data to the extent available. Pricing models may be used, which can vary by asset class and may incorporate available trade, bid and other market information. Across asset classes, information such as trader/dealer input, credit spreads, forward curves, and prepayment speeds are used to help determine appropriate valuations. Because many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, the evaluated pricing applications may apply available information through processes such as benchmarking curves, like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing to prepare valuations. In addition, model processes are used by the pricing services to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios.
We validate the pricing obtained from the primary pricing providers through comparison of pricing to additional sources, including other pricing services, dealer pricing indications in transaction results, and other internal sources. Pricing variances among different pricing sources are analyzed and validated.
As of December 31, 2010, we saw significant improvements in the market value of our portfolio holdings driven by stabilization of the financial markets and reduced risk premiums as compared to 2009. The decrease in the amount of Level 3 securities reflected continued run-off of the securities, the liquidation of our CMBS and MBS securities, and improvement in pricing consistency.
Loans Held For Sale Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost, net of deferred fees, deferred origination costs and effects of hedge accounting, or fair value. The fair value of loans held for sale is determined using current secondary market prices for portfolios with similar characteristics. The carrying amounts as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 approximate fair value.
Loans Held For Investment, Net The fair values of credit card loans, installment loans, auto loans, home loans and commercial loans were estimated using a discounted cash flow method, a form of the income approach. Discount rates were determined considering rates at which similar portfolios of loans would be made under current conditions and considering liquidity spreads applicable to each loan portfolio based on the secondary market. The fair value of credit card loans excluded any value related to customer account relationships. The increase in fair value above carrying amount at December 31, 2010 was primarily due to a tightening of liquidity spreads and improved credit performance noted in our credit card, auto and commercial loan portfolios.
Commercial loans are considered impaired when it is probable that all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms will not be collected. From time to time, we record nonrecurring fair value adjustments to reflect the fair value of the loans collateral. See table of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis above.
Interest Receivable The carrying amount of interest receivable approximates the fair value of this asset due to its relatively short-term nature.
Accounts Receivable from Securitizations Accounts receivable from securitizations include the interest-only strip, retained notes accrued interest receivable, cash reserve accounts and cash spread accounts for those securitization structures achieving off-balance sheet treatment. Refer to Note 7Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations for discussion regarding the adoption of the new accounting consolidation standards on January 1, 2010. We use a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future cash flows. The model incorporates our estimate of assumptions market participants use in determining fair value, including estimates of payment rates, defaults, and discount rates including adjustments for liquidity, and contractual interest and fees. Other retained interests related to securitizations are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. The valuation technique for these securities is discussed in more detail in Note 7Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations.
168 Table of Contents Derivative Assets Most of our derivatives are not exchange traded, but instead traded in over the counter markets where quoted market prices are not readily available. The fair value derived for those derivatives using models that use primarily market observable inputs, such as interest rate yield curves, credit curves, option volatility and currency rates are classified as Level 2. Any derivative fair value measurements using significant assumptions that are unobservable are classified as Level 3, which include interest rate swaps whose remaining terms do not correlate with market observable interest rate yield curves. The impact of counterparty non-performance risk is considered when measuring the fair value of derivative assets. These derivatives are included in other assets on the balance sheet.
We validate the pricing obtained from the internal models through comparison of pricing to additional sources, including external valuation agents and other internal sources. Pricing variances among different pricing sources are analyzed and validated.
Mortgage Servicing Rights MSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. Accordingly, we determine the fair value of MSRs using a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The model incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income, including estimates of prepayment spreads, discount rate, cost to service, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late fees. We record MSRs at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurements of MSRs use significant unobservable inputs and, accordingly, are classified as Level 3. The valuation technique for these securities is discussed in more detail in Note 8Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Financial liabilities Interest Bearing Deposits The fair value of other interest-bearing deposits was determined based on discounted expected cash flows using discount rates consistent with current market rates for similar products with similar remaining terms.
Non-Interest Bearing Deposits The carrying amount of non-interest bearing deposits approximates fair value.
Senior and Subordinated Notes We engage multiple third party pricing services in order to estimate the fair value of senior and subordinated notes. The pricing service utilizes a pricing model that incorporates available trade, bid and other market information. It also incorporates spread assumptions, volatility assumptions and relevant credit information into the pricing models.
Securitized Debt Obligations We utilized multiple third party pricing services to obtain fair value measures for the large majority of our securitized debt obligations.The techniques used by the pricing services utilize observable market data to the extent available; and pricing models may be used which incorporate available trade, bid and other market information as described in the above section.We used internal pricing models, discounted cash flow models or similar techniques to estimate the fair value of certain securitization trusts where third party pricing was not available.
Other Borrowings The carrying amount of federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, and other short-term borrowings approximates fair value. The fair value of junior subordinated borrowings was estimated using the same methodology as described for senior and subordinated notes. The fair value of other borrowings was determined based on trade information for bonds with similar duration and credit quality, adjusted to incorporate any relevant credit information of the issuer. The increase in fair value of other borrowings above carrying values at December 31, 2010 was primarily due to interest rate spreads across the industry and the discounts in secondary trading activity exhibited in the junior subordinated borrowings during the second quarter of 2010.
Interest Payable The carrying amount of interest payable approximates the fair value of this liability due to its relatively short-term nature.
169 Table of Contents Derivative Liabilities Most of our derivatives are not exchange traded, but instead traded in over the counter markets where quoted market prices are not readily available. The fair value of those derivatives, derived using models that use primarily market observable inputs, such as interest rate yield curves, credit curves, option volatility and currency rates, are classified as Level 2. Any derivative fair value measurements using significant assumptions that are unobservable are classified as Level 3, which include interest rate swaps whose remaining terms do not correlate with market observable interest rate yield curves. The impact of counterparty non-performance risk is considered when measuring the fair value of derivative assets. These derivatives are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
We validate the pricing obtained from the internal models through comparison of pricing to additional sources, including external valuation agents and other internal sources. Pricing variances among different pricing sources are analyzed and validated.
Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit These financial instruments are generally not sold or traded. The fair value of the financial guarantees outstanding and included in other liabilities as ofDecember 31, 2010 and 2009 that have been issued since January 1, 2003 was $3 million. The estimated fair values of extensions of credit and letters of credit are not readily available. However, the fair value of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements with comparable credit risks and the current creditworthiness of the counterparties. Commitments to extend credit issued by us are generally short-term in nature and, if drawn upon, are issued under current market terms and conditions for credits with comparable risks. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there was no material unrealized appreciation or depreciation on these financial instruments.
NOTE 20BUSINESS SEGMENTS Segment Description Our principal operations are currently organized into three primary business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served:Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking.The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment are included in the Other category.
Credit Card: Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending,national small business lending, national closed end installment lending and the international card lending businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom.
Consumer Banking: Consists of our branch-based lending and deposit gathering activities for consumer and small businesses, national deposit gathering, national automobile lending and consumer home loan lending and servicing activities.
Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending, deposit gathering and treasury management services to commercial real estate and middle market customers.
Other Category: Includes the residual impact of the allocation of our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management, to our business segments.Accordingly, net gains and losses on our investment securities portfolio and certain trading activities are included in the Other category.The Other category also includes foreign exchange-rate fluctuations related to the revaluation of foreign currency-denominated investments; certain gains (losses) on the sale and securitization of loans; unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as acquisition and restructuring charges;provisions for representation and warranty reserves related to continuing operations; certain material items that are non-recurring in nature; and offsets related to certain line-item reclassifications.
170 Table of Contents Basis of Presentation We report the financial results of our business segments on a continuing operations basis.See Note 3Discontinued Operations for a discussion of discontinued operations.The results of our individual businesses, which are prepared on an internal management accounting and reporting basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources.We refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our managed presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on GAAP.There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the managed basis presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial service companies.In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with GAAP.
Prior to January 1, 2010, our managed-basis presentation assumed that our securitized loans had not been sold and that the earnings from securitized loans were classified in our results of operations in the same manner as the earnings on loans that we owned.Our managed results also reflected differences in accounting for the valuation of retained interests and the recognition of gains and losses on the sale of interest-only strips. Our managed results did not include the addition of an allowance for loan and lease losses for the loans underlying our off-balance sheet securitization trusts. The adoption on January 1, 2010 of the new consolidation accounting standards resulted in accounting for the loans in our securitization trusts in our reported financial statements in a manner similar to how we account for these loans on a managed basis.As a result, our total reported and managed basis presentations are generally comparable for periods beginning after January 1, 2010.
Business Segment Reporting Methodology The results of our business segments are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand-alone business.We have developed allocation methods for use in our internal management accounting and reporting process to assign certain managed balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment.These allocation methods include funds transfer pricing and various other internally-developed methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of each business segment.Due to the integrated nature of our business segments, estimates and judgments have been made in allocating certain revenue and expense items. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods.
Following is a description of the principles and methodologies used in preparing our business segment results.
Net interest income: Interest income from loans held for investment and interest expense from deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities are reflected within each applicable business segment.Because funding and asset/liability management are managed centrally by our Corporate Treasury Group, net interest income for our business segments also includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that is intended to allocate a cost of funds used or credit for funds provided to all business segment assets and liabilities, respectively, using a matched funding concept.Also, taxable-equivalent benefit of tax-exempt products is allocated to each business unit with a corresponding increase in income tax expense.
Non-interest income: Non-interest fees and other revenue associated with loans or customers managed by each business segment and other direct revenues are accounted for within each business segment.
Provision for loan and lease losses: The provisions for loan and lease losses are directly attributable to the business segment in which the loans are managed.
Non-interest expense: Non-interest expenses directly managed and incurred by a business segment are accounted for within each business segment.We allocate certain non-interest expenses indirectly incurred by business segments, such as corporate support functions, to each business segment based on various factors, including the actual cost of the services from the service providers, the utilization of the services, the number of employees or other relevant factors.
Goodwill and other intangible assets: Goodwill and other intangible assets are assigned to business segments based on the relative fair value of each segment.Intangible amortization is included in the results of the applicable segment.
Income taxes: Income taxes are assessed for each business segment based on a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in the Other category.
171 Table of Contents  Loans held for investment: Loans are reported within each business segment based on product or customer type.
Deposits: Deposits are reported within each business segment based on product or customer type.
Segment Results and Reconciliation The following tables provide a summary of our business segment results for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 and selected balance sheet data as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.Total consolidated assets are not allocated among our business segments in the information that is reviewed by our chief operating decision maker.The total of our business segment results and Other category, or Total Managed, differs from our total consolidated reported results. The impact of these differences is reflected in the Securitization Adjustments category.The securitization adjustments remove the impact of presenting off-balance sheet securitized loans in our business segment results in the same manner as on-balance sheet loans to reconcile to our total consolidated reported results.
We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment.

(2) Reflects the impact of adjustments to reconcile our total business segment results, which are presented on a managed basis, to our reported GAAP results.These adjustments primarily consist of: (i) the reclassification of finance charges, past due fees, other interest income and interest expense amounts included in non-interest income for management reporting purposes to net interest income for GAAP reporting purposes and (ii) the reclassification of net charge-offs included in non-interest income for management reporting purposes to the provision for loan and lease losses for GAAP reporting purposes .
(3) In 2009, we completed the restructuring of our operations, which was initiated in 2007 to reduce expenses and improve our competitive cost position.

These adjustments primarily consist of the elimination from total managed loans held for investment credit card loans that have been securitized and accounted for as off-balance sheet transactions in accordance with GAAP to reconcile to our reported loans held for investment.
NOTE 21COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES Letters of Credit We issue letters of credit (financial standby, performance standby and commercial) to meet the financing needs of our customers. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party in a borrowing arrangement. Commercial letters of credit are short-term commitments issued primarily to facilitate trade finance activities for customers and are generally collateralized by the goods being shipped to the client. Collateral requirements are similar to those for funded transactions and are established based on managements credit assessment of the customer. Management conducts regular reviews of all outstanding letters of credit and customer acceptances, and the results of these reviews are considered in assessing the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses.
We had contractual amounts of standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit of $1.8 billion at December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, financial guarantees had expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2016.The fair value of the guarantees outstanding at December 31, 2010 that have been issued since January 1, 2003, was $3 million and was included in other liabilities.
173 Table of Contents Chevy Chase Bank Acquisition On February 27, 2009, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Chevy Chase Bank in exchange for our common stock and cash.In addition, to the extent that losses on certain of Chevy Chase Banks home loans are less than the level reflected in the net credit mark estimated at the time the deal was signed, we are obligated to share a portion of the benefit with the former Chevy Chase Bank common stockholders (the earn-out). The maximum payment under the earn-out is $300 million and would occur after December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, we have not recognized a liability with the earn-out based on our expectation of credit losses on the portfolio.
Potential Mortgage Representation & Warranty Liabilities In recent years, we acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold them to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts.These subsidiaries are Capital One Home Loans, which was acquired in February 2005; GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. (GreenPoint), which was acquired in December 2006 as part of the North Fork acquisition; and Chevy Chase Bank, which was acquired in February 2009 and subsequently merged into CONA.
In connection with their sales of mortgage loans, the subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the loans compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser, including underwriting guidelines and the ongoing existence of mortgage insurance, and the loans compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws.The representations and warranties do not address the credit performance of the mortgage loans, but mortgage loan performance often influences whether a claim for breach of representation and warranty will be asserted and has an effect on the amount of any loss in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty.
Each of these subsidiaries may be required to repurchase mortgage loans in the event of certain breaches of these representations and warranties.In the event of a repurchase, the subsidiary is typically required to pay the then unpaid principal balance of the loan together with interest and certain expenses (including, in certain cases, legal costs incurred by the purchaser and/or others). The subsidiary then recovers the loan or, if the loan has been foreclosed, the underlying collateral.The subsidiary is exposed to any losses on the repurchased loans after giving effect to any recoveries on the collateral. In some instances, rather than repurchase the loans, a subsidiary may agree to make a cash payment to make an investor whole on losses or to settle repurchase claims. In addition, our subsidiaries may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur as a result of certain breaches of representations and warranties. In some cases, the amount of such losses could exceed the repurchase amount of the related loans.
These subsidiaries, in total, originated and sold to non-affiliates approximately $111 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans between 2005 and 2008, which are the years (or vintages) with respect to which our subsidiaries have received the vast majority of the repurchase requests and other related claims.
The following table sets forth the original principal balance of mortgage loan originations by vintage for the three general categories of purchasers of mortgage loans: Original Principal Balance of Mortgage Loans Originated and Sold to Third Parties Based on Category of Purchaser (Dollars in billions) 2005 2006 2007 2008 Total Government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) (1) $ 3 $ 3 $ 4 $ 1 $ 11 Insured Securitizations 9 8 1 0 18 Uninsured Securitizations and Other 33 30 16 3 82 Total $ 45 $ 41 $ 21 $ 4 $ 111 _______________ (1) GSEs include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
174 Table of Contents Between 2005 and 2008, our subsidiaries sold an aggregate amount of $11 billion in original principal balance mortgage loans to the GSEs.
Of the $18 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans sold directly by our subsidiaries to private-label purchasers who placed the loans into securitizations supported by bond insurance (Insured Securitizations), approximately $13 billion original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have made repurchase requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries (Active Insured Securitizations), and the remaining approximately $5 billion original principalbalance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have not made repurchase requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries (Inactive Insured Securitizations).Insured Securitizations often allow the monoline bond insurer to act independently of the investors.Bond insurers typically have indemnity agreements directly with both the mortgage originators and the securitizers, and they often have super-majority rights within the trust documentation that allow them to direct trustees to pursue mortgage repurchase requests without coordination with other investors.
Because we do not service most of the loans our subsidiaries sold to others, we do not have complete information about the current ownership of the $82 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans not sold directly to GSEs or placed in Insured Securitizations.We have determined from third-party databases that about $39 billion original principal balance of these mortgage loans are currently held by private-label publicly issued securitizations not supported by bond insurance (Uninsured Securitizations).In contrast with the bond insurers in Insured Securitizations, investors in Uninsured Securitizations often face a number of legal and logistical hurdles before they can direct a securitization trustee to pursue mortgage repurchases, including the need to coordinate with a certain percentage of investors holding the securities and to indemnify the trustee for any litigation it undertakes. An additional approximately $30 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans were initially sold to private investors as whole loans.Of this amount, we believe approximately $10 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans were ultimately purchased by GSEs.For purposes of our reserves-setting process, we consider these loans to be private-label loans rather than GSE loans.We do not have information about the current holders or disposition of the remaining $13 billion original principal balance mortgage loans in this category.
With respect to the $111 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans originated and sold to others between 2005 and 2008, we estimate that approximately $45 billion in unpaid principal balance remains outstanding, approximately $12 billion in losses have been realized, and approximately $13 billion in unpaid principal balance is at least 90 days delinquent.Because we do not service most of the loans we sold to others, we do not have complete information about the underlying credit performance levels of these mortgage loans, but these amounts reflect our best estimates based on available data, including extrapolated estimates for the $13 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans about which we do not have information about the current holders.These estimates could change as we get additional data or refine our analysis.
As of December 31, 2010, the subsidiaries had open repurchase requests relating to approximately $1.6 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans as compared with $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2009.
Over the last year, the vast majority of new repurchase demands received and, as discussed below, almost all of our $816 million reserves, relate to the $24 billion of original principal balance of mortgage loans originally sold to the GSEs or to Active Insured Securitizations.Currently, repurchase demands predominantly relate to the 2006 and 2007 vintages.We have received relatively few repurchase demands from the 2008 and 2009 vintages, mostly because GreenPoint ceased originating mortgages in August 2007.
The following tables set forth information on pending repurchase requests by counterparty category and timing of initial repurchase request: Open Pipeline All Vintages (all entities) (1) (Dollars in millions) (All amounts are Original Principal Balance) Open Claims at 12/31/09 Gross New Demands Received in 2010 Loans Repurchased/Made Wholein 2010 (2) Demands Rescinded in 2010 (2) Open Claims at 12/31/10 GSEs $ 61 $ 204 $ (52 ) $ (87 ) $ 126 Insured Securitizations 366 645 (179 ) 0 832 Uninsured Securitizations and Others 588 104 (5 ) (22 ) 665 Total $ 1,015 $ 953 $ (236 ) $ (109 ) $ 1,623 175 Table of Contents (1) The open pipeline includes all repurchase requests ever received by our subsidiaries where either the requesting party has not formally rescinded the repurchase request and where our subsidiary has not agreed to either repurchase the loan at issue or make the requesting party whole with respect to its losses.Accordingly, repurchase requests denied by our subsidiaries and not pursued by the counterparty remain in the open pipeline.Moreover, repurchase requests submitted by parties without contractual standing to pursue repurchase requests are included within the open pipeline unless the requesting party has formally rescinded its repurchase request.Finally, the amounts reflected in this chart are the original principal balance amounts of the mortgage loans at issue and do not correspond to the losses our subsidiary would incur upon the repurchase of these loans.
(2) Activity in 2010 relates to repurchase demands from all years.
We have established representation and warranty reserves for losses that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary, including both litigation and non-litigation liabilities.These reserves are reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities.The reserve-setting process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires the application of judgment. We evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis.We build our representation and warranty reserves through the provision for repurchase losses, which we report in our consolidated statements of income as a component of non-interest income for loans originated and sold by Chevy Chase Bank and Capital One Home Loans and as a component of discontinued operations for loans originated and sold by GreenPoint.In establishing the representation and warranty reserves, we consider a variety of factors depending on the category of purchaser.
In establishing reserves for the $11 billion original principal balance of GSE loans, we rely on the historical relationship between GSE loan losses and repurchase outcomes to estimate:(1) the percentage of current and future GSE loan defaults that we anticipate will result in repurchase requests from the GSEs over the lifetime of the GSE loans; and (2) the percentage of those repurchase requests that we anticipate will result in actual repurchases.We also rely on estimated collateral valuations and loss forecast models to estimate our lifetime liability on GSE loans.This reserving approach to the GSE loans reflects the historical interaction with the GSEs around repurchase requests.The GSEs have stronger contractual rights than non-GSE counterparties because GSE contracts typically do not contain prompt notice requirements for repurchase requests or materiality qualifications to the representations and warranties.Moreover, although we often disagree with the GSEs about the validity of their repurchase requests, we have established a negotiation pattern whereby the GSEs and our subsidiaries continually negotiate around individual repurchase requests, leading to the GSEs rescinding some repurchase requests and our subsidiaries agreeing in some cases to repurchase some loans or make the GSEs whole with respect to losses.Our lifetime representation and warranty reserves with respect to GSE loans are grounded in this history.
For the $13 billion original principal balance in Active Insured Securitizations, our reserving approach also reflects our historical interaction with monoline bond insurers around repurchase requests.Typically, monoline bond insurers allege a very high repurchase rate with respect to the mortgage loans in the Active Insured Securitization category.In response to these repurchase requests, our subsidiaries typically request information from the monoline bond insurers demonstrating that the contractual requirements for a valid repurchase request have been satisfied, typically, for example, that the counterparty promptly notify us upon discovery of any breach and that any breach materially and adversely affect the value of the mortgage loan at issue.In response to these requests for supporting documentation, monoline bond insurers typicallyinitiate litigation.Accordingly, our reserves for the Active Insured Securitization category are not based upon the historical repurchase rate with monoline bond insurers, but rather upon the expected resolution of litigation with the monoline bond insurers.Every bond insurer within this categoryis pursuing a substantially similar litigation strategy either through active or probable litigation.Accordingly, our representation and warranty reserves for this category are litigation reserves.In establishing litigation reserves for this category, we consider current and future losses inherent within the securitization and apply legal judgment to the anticipated factual and legal record to estimate the lifetime legal liability for each securitization.Our estimated legal liability for each securitization within this category assumes that we will be responsible for only a portion of the losses inherent in each securitization.Our litigation reserves with respect to both the U.S. Bank Lawsuit and the DBSP Lawsuit, in each case as discussed below, are contained within the Active Insured Securitization reserve category.Further, our litigation reserves with respect to indemnification risks from certain representation and warranty lawsuits brought by monoline bond insurers against third-party securitizations sponsors, where GreenPoint provided some or all of the mortgage collateral within the securitization but is not a defendant in the litigation, are also contained within this category.
176 Table of Contents For the $5 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in the Inactive Insured Securitizations category and the $82 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in the Uninsured Securitizations and other whole loans sales category, we establish reserves by relying on our historical repurchase rates to estimate repurchase liabilities for these categories over the next twelve (12) months.We do not believe we can estimate repurchase liability for these categories for a period longer than 12 months because of the relatively sporadic nature of repurchase requests from these categories.Although we have not seen any significant activity from new counterparties from these categories, there has been a recent uptick in negotiation intensity from some counterparties who had submitted repurchase claims in earlier quarters with respect to whole loans.In addition, some Uninsured Securitization investors from this category have not made repurchase requests or filed representation and warranty lawsuits, but instead have filed class actions under federal and state securities laws against investment banks and securitization sponsors.Although we face some indemnity risks from these litigations, we have not established reserves with respect to these indemnity risks because we do not consider them to be both probable and reasonably estimable liabilities.
The aggregate reserves for all three subsidiaries were $816 million as of December 31, 2010 as compared with $238 million as of December 31, 2009.We recorded a total provision for repurchase losses for our representation and warranty repurchase exposure of $636 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.During 2010, we had settlements of repurchase requests totaling $58 million that were charged against the reserve.The table below summarizes changes in our representation and warranty reserves for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.

(2) The portion of the provision for mortgage repurchase claims recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of non-interest income totaled $204 million and $19 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. The portion of the provision for mortgage repurchase claims recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of discontinued operations totaled $432 million and $162 million, pre-tax, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
(3) Includes increases to the representation and warranty reserves in the first and second quarter of 2010 due primarily to counterparty activity and our ability to extend the timeframe over which we estimate our repurchase liability for mortgage loans sold by our subsidiaries to GSEs and those mortgage loans placed into Active Insured Securitizations for the full life of the mortgage loans sold by our subsidiaries for groups of loans for which we believe repurchases are probable. More specifically, of the $636 million increase in representation and warranty reserves for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010,approximately $407million resulted from our ability to extendrepurchase liability estimates to the life of the loan effective in the second quarter of 2010.The remaining $229million related primarily to changing counterparty activity in the form of updated estimates around active and probable litigation, most of which occurred in the first quarter of 2010.
As indicated in the table below, almost all of the reserves relate to the $11 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans sold directly to the GSEs and to the $13 billion in mortgage loans sold to purchasers who placed them into Active Insured Securitizations.

177 Table of Contents The adequacy of the reserves and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by our subsidiaries will depend on, among other things, actual future mortgage loan performance, the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests (including the extent, if any, to which Inactive Insured Securitizations and other currently inactive investors ultimately assert claims), the actual success rates of claimants, developments in litigation, actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices).
As part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the potential future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not arise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes that would justify an incremental reserve accrual under applicable accounting standards.We believe that the upper end of thereasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond the current accrual levels, including reasonably possible future losses relating to the US Bank Litigation and DBSP Litigation (see below),could be as high as$1.1 billion.Notwithstanding our attempt to estimate a reasonably possible amount of loss beyond our current accrual levels based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and the amount of reasonably possible losses estimated here.There is still significant uncertainty as to numerous factors that contribute to ultimate liability levels, including, but not limited to, litigation outcomes, future repurchase claims levels, ultimate repurchase success rates, and mortgage loan performance levels.
Litigation In accordance with the current accounting standards for loss contingencies, we establish reserves for litigation related matters when it is probable that a loss associated with a claim or proceeding has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.Litigation claims and proceedings of all types are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance.Below we provide a description of material legal proceedings and claims.
The Banks are members of Visa U.S.A., Inc. (Visa). As members, our subsidiary banks have indemnification obligations to Visa with respect to final judgments and settlements of certain litigation against Visa.In 2005, a number of entities, each purporting to represent a class of retail merchants, filed antitrust lawsuits (the Interchange Lawsuits) against MasterCard and Visa and several member banks, including the Company and its subsidiaries, alleging among other things, that the defendants conspired to fix the level of interchange fees. The complaints seek injunctive relief and civil monetary damages, which could be trebled. Separately, a number of large merchants have asserted similar claims against Visa and MasterCard only. In October 2005, the class and merchant Interchange lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes, including discovery. Fact and expert discovery have closed.The parties have briefed and presented oral argument on motions to dismiss and class certification and are awaiting decisions from the court.
In the first quarter of 2008, Visa completed an IPO of its stock. With IPO proceeds, Visa established an escrow account for the benefit of member banks to fund certain litigation settlements and claims, including the Interchange Lawsuits. As a result, in the first quarter of 2008, we reduced our Visa-related indemnification liabilities of $91 million recorded in other liabilities with a corresponding reduction of other non-interest expense. We made an election in accordance with the accounting guidance for fair value option for financial assets and liabilities on the indemnification guarantee to Visa, and the fair value of the guarantee at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 was zero.In January, 2011, we entered into a MasterCard Settlement and Judgment Sharing Agreement, along with other defendant banks, which apportions any costs and liabilities of any judgment or settlement arising from the Interchange Lawsuits.
In 2007, a number of individual plaintiffs, each purporting to represent a class of cardholders, filed antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against several issuing banks, including the Company (the In Re Late Fees Litigation). These lawsuits allege, among other things, that the defendants conspired to fix the level of late fees and over-limit fees charged to cardholders, and that these fees are excessive. In May 2007, the cases were consolidated for all purposes, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed alleging violations of federal statutes and state law. The amended complaint requests civil monetary damages, which could be trebled, and injunctive relief.In November 2007, the court dismissed the amended complaint. Plaintiffs appealed that order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The plaintiffs appeal challenges the dismissal of their claims under National Bank Act, the Depository Institutions Deregulation Act of 1980 and the California Unfair Competition Law, but not their antitrust conspiracy claims. In June 2009, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the matter pending the bankruptcy proceedings of one of the defendant financial institutions. In December 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals entered an additional order continuing the stay of the matter pending the bankruptcy proceedings.
178 Table of Contents Between January and April 2010, eight substantially similar putative class actions were filed against COBNA and Capital One Services, LLC (COSI) challenging various marketing practices relating to the payment protection product: Blackie v. Capital One Bank, et al.
(U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania); Carr v. Capital One Bank, et al.
(U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey); McCoy v. Capital One Bank, et al.
(U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California); Mitchell v. Capital One Bank, et al.
(U.S. District Court for the Central District of California); Salazar v. Capital One Bank, et al.
(U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina); Smith v. Capital One Bank, et al.
(U.S. District Court for the District of Arkansas); Sullivan v. Capital One Bank, et al, (U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut); Watlington v. Capital One Bank, et al.
(U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina) (collectively The Payment Protection Class Actions). The Payment Protection Class Actions seek a range of remedies, including compensatory damages, punitive damages, restitution, disgorgement, injunctive relief and attorneys fees. Each of these cases is in early stages. In addition, in September 2009, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida certified a statewide class action in Spinelli v. Capital One Bank, et al.
with respect to the marketing of the payment protection product in Florida. In May 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied COBNAs and COSIs petition for interlocutory review of the class certification order, allowing the case to proceed toward the summary judgment stage.In May 2010, COBNA and COSI entered into a preliminary global settlement with the various putative class counsel in The Payment Protection Class Actions.In August 2010, the Florida federal court issued a preliminary approval order for the settlement.After hearings in November and December, 2010, the Florida federal court issued a final approval order for the settlement.We believe the total expected costs of the settlement will be within the non-material litigation reserve amount established in the second quarter of 2010, and as a result, we do not believe the amount necessary to resolve the litigation will be material to our financial conditions or results of operations.
In July 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed a dismissal entered in favor of COBNA in Rubio v. Capital One Bank , which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in 2007.The plaintiff in Rubio alleged in a putative class action that COBNA breached its contractual obligations and violated the Truth In Lending Act (the TILA) and Californias Unfair Competition Law (the UCL) when it raised interest rates on certain credit card accounts.The District Court granted COBNAs motion to dismiss all claims as a matter of law prior to any discovery.On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Courts dismissal with respect to the TILA and UCL claims, remanding the case back to the District Court for further proceedings.The Ninth Circuit upheld the dismissal of the plaintiff's breach of contract claim, finding that COBNA was contractually allowed to increase interest rates.In September 2010, the Ninth Circuit denied COBNAs Petition for Panel Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc.
In January, 2011, COBNA filed a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, seeking leave to appeal the Ninth Circuits ruling.
The Capital One Bank Credit Card Interest Rate Multi-district Litigation matter involves similar issues as Rubio .This multi-district litigation matter was created as a result of a June 2010 transfer order issued by the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (MDL), which consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia two pending putative class actions against COBNA -- Nancy Mancuso, et al. v. Capital One Bank (USA) , N.A., et al ., (E.D. Virginia); and Kevin S. Barker, et al. v. Capital One Bank (USA), N.A.
, (N.D. Georgia),A third action, Jennifer L. Kolkowski v. Capital One Bank (USA), N.A ., (C.D. California) was subsequently transferred into the MDL.On August 2, 2010, the plaintiffs in the MDL filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint.The Consolidated Amended Complaint alleges in a putative class action that COBNA breached its contractual obligations, and violated the Truth in Lending Act (the TILA), the California Consumers Legal Remedies Act, the California Unfair Competition Law, the California False Advertising Act, the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, and the Kansas Consumer Protection Act when it raised interest rates on certain credit card accounts.The parties are currently conducting discovery.
In January 2010, the West Virginia Attorney General filed suit against COBNA and various affiliates in Mason County, West Virginia, challenging numerous credit card practices under the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act.The West Virginia Attorney General seeks injunctive relief, consumer refunds, statutory damages, disgorgement, and attorneys fees. COBNA removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia and filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.In July 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia remanded the case back to Mason County Circuit Court and denied the motion to dismiss as moot.In August 2010, we filed a motion to dismiss and a motion to stay discovery pending resolution of the motion to dismiss.In January 2011, the Court took our motion to dismiss under advisement, while permitting discovery to proceed.
On February 5, 2009, GreenPoint was named as a defendant in a lawsuit commenced in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, by U.S. Bank National Association, Syncora Guarantee Inc. (formerly known as XL Capital Assurance Inc.) and CIFG Assurance North America, Inc.(the U.S. Bank Litigation).Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that GreenPoint breached certain representations and warranties in two contracts pursuant to which GreenPoint sold approximately 30,000 mortgage loans having an aggregate original principal balance of approximately $1.8 billion to a purchaser that ultimately transferred most of these mortgage loans to a securitization trust. Some of the securities issued by the trust were insured by two of the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs have alleged breaches of representations and warranties with respect to a limited number of specific mortgage loans. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and an order compelling GreenPoint to repurchase the entire portfolio of 30,000 mortgage loans based on alleged breaches of representations and warranties relating to a limited sampling of loans in the portfolio, or, alternatively, the repurchase of specific mortgage loans to which the alleged breaches of representations and warranties relate. On March 3, 2010, the Court granted GreenPoints motion to dismiss with respect to plaintiffs Syncora and CIFG and denied the motion with respect to U.S. Bank.In March 2010, GreenPoint answered the complaint with respect to U.S. Bank, denying the allegations, and filed a counterclaim against U.S. Bank alleging breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing.In April 2010, plaintiffs U.S. Bank, Syncora, and CIFG filed an amended complaint seeking, among other things, the repurchase remedies described above and indemnification for losses suffered by Syncora and CIFG.GreenPoint filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.
On January 6, 2011, the Court instructed plaintiffs to seek leave of court to file an amended complaint supported by an evidentiary showing of merit.
As noted above, GreenPoint has established reserves with respect to its probable and reasonably estimable legal liability from the U.S. Bank Lawsuit, which reserves are included within the overall representation and warranty reserve.Also as noted above, GreenPoint has exposure to loss in excess of the amount established within the overall representation and warranty reserve because GreenPoint has not established reserves with respect to the portfolio-wide repurchase claim on the basis that the claim is not considered probable and reasonably estimable.In the event GreenPoint is obligated to repurchase all 30,000 mortgage loans under the portfolio-wide repurchase claim, GreenPoint would incur the current and future economic losses inherent in the portfolio.With respect to the mortgage loan portfolio at issue in the U.S. Bank Litigation, we believe approximately $745 million of losses have been realized and approximately $437 million in mortgage loans are still outstanding, of which approximately $36 million are more than 90 days delinquent, including foreclosures and REO.
179 Table of Contents In September 2010, DB Structured Products, Inc. ("DBSP") named GreenPoint in a third-party complaint, filed in the New York County Supreme Court, alleging breach of contract and seeking indemnification (the DBSP Litigation). In the underlying suit, Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. ("AGM") sued DBSP for alleged breaches of representations and warranties made by DBSP with respect to certain residential mortgage loans that collateralize a securitization insured by AGM and sponsored by DBSP (the Underlying Lawsuit).DBSP purchased the HELOC loans from GreenPoint in 2006.The entire securitization is comprised of about 6,200 mortgage loans with an aggregate original principal balance of approximately $353 million.DBSP asserts that any liability it faces lies with GreenPoint, alleging that DBSP's representations and warranties to AGM are substantially similar to the representations and warranties made by GreenPoint to DBSP.GreenPoint filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in October, 2010, which motion is pending before the court.The parties are currently engaged in discovery. As noted above, GreenPoint has established reserves with respect to its estimated probable and reasonable estimable legal liability from the DBSP Litigation, which reserves are included within the overall representation and warranty reserve. Also as noted above, GreenPoint has not established a reserve with respect to any portfolio-wide repurchase claim, but in the event GreenPoint is obligated to indemnify for DBSP for the repurchase of all 6,200 mortgage loans, GreenPoint would incur the current and future economic losses inherent in the securitization. With respect to these loans, we believe approximately $128 million of losses have been realized and approximately $75 million in mortgage loans are still outstanding, of which approximately $4 million are more than 90 days delinquent, including foreclosures and REO.
Since July 2009, we have been providing documents and information in response to an inquiry by the Staff of the SEC. In the first quarter of 2010, the SEC issued a formal order of investigation with respect to this inquiry. Although the order, as is generally customary, authorizes a broader inquiry by the Staff, we believe that the investigation is focused largely on our method of determining the loan loss reserves for our auto finance business for certain quarterly periods in 2007. We are cooperating fully with the Staffs investigation.
In May 2010, Capital One Financial Corporation and COBNA were named as defendants in a putative class action named Steen v. Capital One Financial Corporation, et al., filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.Plaintiff challenges our practices relating to fees for overdraft and non-sufficient funds fees on consumer checking accounts.Plaintiff alleges that our methodology for posting transactions to customer accounts is designed to maximize the generation of overdraft fees, supporting claims for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unconscionability, conversion, unjust enrichment and violations of state unfair trade practices laws.Plaintiff seeks a range of remedies, including restitution, disgorgement, injunctive relief, punitive damages and attorneys fees.In May, 2010, the case was transferred to the Southern District of Florida for coordinated pre-trial proceedings as part of a multi-district litigation (MDL) involving numerous defendant banks, In re Checking Account Overdraft Litigation .In January 2011 , plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint against CONA in the MDL court.In February 2011, CONAfiled a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint.
On September 21, 2009, the Tax Court issued as decision in the case Capital One Financial Corporation and Subsidiaries v. Commissioner covering tax years 1995-1999, with both parties prevailing on certain issues.On July 6, 2010, we filed a motion to appeal certain issues upon which the IRS prevailed.The IRS chose not to appeal the issues upon which we prevailed resulting in a final resolution of those issues favorable to us.Although the final resolution of the remaining issues in the case is uncertain and involves unsettled areas of law, weaccounted for this matter applying the recognition and measurement criteria required for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.
180 Table of Contents For some of the matters disclosed above, we are able todetermineestimates of potential future outcomes that that are not probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying either the establishment of a reserve or an incremental reserve build, but which are reasonably possible outcomes.For other disclosed matters, such an estimate is not possible at this time.For those matters where an estimate is possible, excluding the reasonably possible future losses relating to the US Bank Litigation and the DBSP Litigation because reasonably possible losses with respect to those litigations are included within the range of reasonably possible representation and warranty liabilities discussed above, management currently estimates the aggregate high end of the range of possible loss is $73 million to $171 million.Notwithstanding our attempt to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss beyond our current accrual levels for some litigation matters based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and the range of reasonably possible losses disclosed here.Given the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from these litigation matters and an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period.
Other Pending and Threatened Litigation In addition, we are commonly subject to various pending and threatened legal actions relating to the conduct of our normal business activities. In the opinion of management, the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of all such other pending or threatened legal actions will not be material to our consolidated financial position or our results of operations.
NOTE 22SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK We are active in originating loans in the United States and internationally. International loans are originated in Canada and the United Kingdom. We review each potential customers credit application and evaluate the applicants financial history and ability and willingness to repay. Loans are made on an unsecured and secured basis. Certain commercial, small business, home loans and automobile loans require collateral in various forms including cash deposits, automobiles and real estate, as appropriate. We have higher concentrations of loans where the Commercial and Consumer Banking segments operate, the South and Northeast regions of the U.S. In particular, our commercial portfolio is concentrated in the New York metropolitan area.

184 Table of Contents NOTE 25 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS In the ordinary course of business, we may have loans issued to our executive officers, directors, and principal stockholders, also known as Regulation O Insiders. Pursuant to our policy, such loans are issued on the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans to unrelated persons and do not involve more than the normal risk of collectibility.At December31, 2009, we determined that a commercial real estate loan with outstanding principal of $38 million, of which a director at the time was an indirect member of the borrowing group, was subject to doubt as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms.On March 31, 2010, CONA sold the loan to a third party in an arms-length transaction for total proceeds of $35 million.

187 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of Capital One Financial Corporation (the Company or Capital One) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Companys Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.
Capital Ones internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Companys assets; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Companys management and directors; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010, based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, commonly referred to as the COSO criteria.
Based on the assessment performed, management concluded that, as of December31, 2010, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the criteria established by COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework.Additionally, based upon managements assessment, the Company determined that there were no material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.
The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010, has been audited by Ernst and Young, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010.
/S/ RICHARD D. FAIRBANK Richard D. Fairbank Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President /S/GARY L. PERLIN Gary L. Perlin Chief Financial Officer March 1, 2011 188 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Capital One Financial Corporation We have audited Capital One Financial Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Capital One Financial Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Capital One Financial Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria .
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Capital One Financial Corporationas of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 of Capital One Financial Corporation and our report dated March 1, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Capital One Financial Corporation at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for transfers of financial assets and consolidations effective January 1, 2010. As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2009 the Company changed its method of accounting for the impairment of debt securities.
