Business.
Overview Capital One Financial Corporation (the Corporation) is a diversified financial services company, incorporated in Delaware on July21, 1994, whose banking and non-banking subsidiaries market a variety of financial products and services. The Corporations principal subsidiaries include Capital One Bank (the Bank), a Virginia state chartered bank that currently offers credit card products and deposit products and can also engage in a wide variety of lending and other financial activities; Capital One, F.S.B. (the Savings Bank), a federally chartered savings bank that offers consumer and commercial lending and consumer deposit products; Capital One Auto Finance, Inc. (COAF), which offers automobile and other motor vehicle financing products; and Hibernia National Bank (the National Bank), a nationally chartered bank that offers a broad spectrum of financial products and services to consumers, small business and commercial clients. Capital One Services, Inc. (COSI), another subsidiary of the Corporation, provides various operating, administrative and other services to the Corporation and its subsidiaries. The Corporation and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the Company. Unless indicated otherwise, the terms Corporation, we, us, and our refer to the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
The Corporation became a financial holding company on May27, 2005, thereby allowing the Corporation the authority to engage in certain activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies, including the authority to acquire all of the subsidiaries of Hibernia Corporation (Hibernia), which occurred in November 2005.
As of December31, 2005, we had $47.9 billion in deposits and $105.5 billion in managed loans outstanding. We are among the largest issuers of Visa  (Visa) and MasterCard  (MasterCard) credit cards in the United States based on managed credit card loans outstanding and we are the 20 th largest depository institution in the United States.
We offer our products throughout the United States. We also offer our products outside of the United States principally through Capital One Bank (Europe) plc, an indirect subsidiary of the Bank organized and located in the United Kingdom (the U.K. Bank), and a branch of the Bank in Canada. Our U.K. Bank has authority, among other things, to accept deposits and provide credit card and installment loans. Important factors underlying the growth of our lending and deposit activities include industry dynamics, including the level of competition, and our business strategies. These business strategies involve analyzing and applying results derived from large quantities of data to reduce credit risk, mass customizing products for consumers and achieving operational efficiency.
We strive to use data analysis to differentiate among customers based on credit risk, usage and other characteristics and to match customer characteristics with appropriate product offerings. To do this, we have built, and continue to enhance, sophisticated models and information systems. We employ a well-trained staff to identify, develop and market credit cards and other consumer products and services to satisfy the demands of a competitive and ever changing marketplace. By actively testing a wide variety of product and service features, marketing channels and other aspects of offerings, we design customized solicitations, products and services that are targeted at specific credit customer segments, thereby enhancing response levels and maximizing returns on investment within given underwriting parameters.
We build on information derived from our initial sources with continued integrated testing and model development to improve the quality, performance and profitability of our solicitation and account management initiatives. We use this approach in all areas of our business, including solicitations, account management, credit line management, pricing strategies, usage stimulation, collections, recoveries, and account and balance 3 Table of Contents retention. An important element of our diversification and growth strategy has been to apply our methodologies to consumer financial products and services beyond credit cards, such as automobile and small business lending.
Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol COF. Our principal executive office is located at 1680 Capital One Drive, McLean, Virginia 22102 (telephone number (703)720-1000). The Corporation maintains a website at www.capitalone.com . Documents available on our website include (i)Codes of Business Conduct and Ethics for the Corporation and the National Bank, (ii)the Corporations Corporate Governance Principles; (iii)and charters for the Audit and Risk, Compensation, Finance and Trust Oversight, and Governance and Nominating Committees. These documents are also available in print to any shareholder who requests a copy. In addition, we make available free of charge through our website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after electronic filing or furnishing of such material with the SEC.
Business Description Capital One is one of the worlds largest financial services franchises. We are a diversified financial services corporation focused primarily on consumer lending and deposits. Our principal business segments are domestic credit card lending, automobile and other motor vehicle financing and global financial services. Beginning with the first quarter of 2006, we will be reporting a banking segment. For further discussion of our segments, see pages 46-50 in Item7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsReportable Segment Summary and pages 84-86 in Item8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 3.
U.S. Card Segment . We offer a wide variety of credit card products throughout the United States. We customize our products to appeal to different consumer preferences and needs by combining different product features, including annual percentage rates, fees and credit limits, rewards programs and other special features. We routinely test new products to develop ones that appeal to different and changing consumer preferences. Our customized products include both products offered to a wide range of consumer credit risk profiles, as well as products aimed at special consumer interests. Our pricing strategies are risk-based; lower risk customers may likely be offered products with more favorable pricing and we expect these products to yield lower delinquencies and credit losses. On products offered to higher risk customers, however, we are likely to experience higher delinquencies and losses, and we price these products accordingly.
Auto Finance Segment . Through COAF, we purchase retail installment contracts, secured by automobiles or other motor vehicles, through dealer networks throughout the United States. Additionally, we utilize direct marketing to offer automobile financing directly to consumers. Our direct marketed products include financing for the purchase of new and used vehicles, as well as refinancing of existing motor vehicle loans. As of December31, 2005, we are the second largest non-captive auto lender in the United States. In January 2005, we acquired Onyx Acceptance Corporation, an auto finance company that provides financing to franchised and select independent dealerships throughout the United States. The Corporation also completed the acquisition of Key Banks non-prime auto loan portfolio in 2005. Similar to our credit card strategy, we customize product features, such as interest rate, loan amount, and loan terms, enabling us to lend to customers with a wide range of credit profiles.
Global Financial Services Segment . Our Global Financial Services (GFS) segment includes a variety of diverse products offered to consumers in the United States and internationally. Domestically, GFS includes small business lending, installment lending, and healthcare financing. In addition, in early 2005, the Corporation acquired a mortgage lending business, eSmartloan. We have, and may in the future achieve further diversification through acquisition, organic growth or both. GFS also includes our international businesses, where we are using methodologies and approaches we have learned in our U.S. credit card and other consumer lending businesses in new geographies. Internationally, we are currently operating primarily in the United Kingdom and Canada. The Corporation completed its acquisition of Hfs Group, a home equity broker in the United Kingdom, in January 2005.
4 Table of Contents Acquisition of Hibernia Corporation On November16, 2005, we completed our acquisition of Hibernia, a financial holding company that provides a wide array of financial products and services through its bank and non-bank subsidiaries. Under the merger agreement, Hibernia merged with and into the Corporation, and Capital One continued as the surviving corporation. We are focused on successfully integrating Hibernia into the Corporation, and beginning with the first quarter of 2006, we will begin reporting on a new Banking segment. The Banking segment will consist of Hibernias former businesses, excluding Hibernias indirect auto business and including Capital Ones existing branchless deposit business.
Geographic Diversity Loan portfolio concentration within a specific geographic region may be regarded differently based upon the current and expected credit characteristics and performance of the portfolio. Our loan portfolio is geographically diverse. See page 114 in Item8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 23 of this form.
Enterprise Risk Management Risk is an inherent part of the Companys business and activities. The Company has an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program designed to ensure appropriate and comprehensive oversight and management of risk. The ERM program has three components. First, the Board of Directors and senior management committees oversee risk and risk management practices. Second, the centralized departments headed by the Chief Enterprise Risk Officer and the Chief Credit Officer establish risk management methodologies, processes and standards. Third, the individual business areas throughout the Company are responsible for managing risk in their businesses and performing ongoing identification, assessment and response to risks. The Companys ERM framework includes eight categories of risk: credit, liquidity, market, operational, legal, strategic, reputation, and compliance.
Board and Senior Management Oversight A combination of the Board and senior management committees is used to oversee the management of risk. The Audit and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the Companys accounting, financial reporting, internal controls and risk assessment and management processes. The Audit and Risk Committee also reviews periodic reporting on significant Company risks and mitigation activities and compliance with corporate risk policies. The Board Finance and Trust Oversight Committee oversees liquidity and market risk. The Executive Committee, a committee of senior management chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, provides guidance to senior executives regarding strategic risk and provides an integrated view of risk through reports by the Companys other senior management committees:  Enterprise Risk Management Committee provides advice and counsel to the Chief Enterprise Risk Officer and other executives on enterprise risk management governance, process, methodologies and reporting, with a primary focus on operational and compliance risk.
Enterprise Operating Committee provides advice and guidance to senior executives on significant matters affecting the Companys associates, infrastructure, reputation and operations. The Committee seeks to drive awareness of the Companys reputational risks, mobilize management of such risks, ensure the alignment of the Companys policies and resources with its strategic business priorities and encourage innovation and leadership.
Credit Policy Committee provides advice and counsel to the Chief Credit Officer and other executives on credit policy decisions; approves certain credit policies; reviews data pertaining to the credit control environment, including Board approved risk tolerances; reviews regulatory, audit and credit review findings; assesses the adequacy of corrective actions; and provides direction on credit risk management.
5 Table of Contents  Asset and Liability Management Committee provides advice and counsel to the Chief Financial Officer and other executives on the acquisition and deployment of funds, the liquidity position of the Company and its subsidiaries capital management, off-balance sheet activities, and activities related to the management of interest rate risk, and investment activities.
Integrity, Ethical Values and Risk Management Culture The Company maintains its risk management culture through various mechanisms designed to bring the consideration of risk into daily decision making. The Company has a corporate Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, available on the Corporate Governance page of its website at www.capitalone.com/about , under which each associate is obligated to behave with integrity in dealing with customers and business partners and to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The Company also has a compliance training program and an associate performance management process that emphasize achieving business results while ensuring integrity, legal compliance and sound business management. The Companys risk management culture is also encouraged through frequent direction and communications from the Board of Directors, senior leadership, corporate and departmental risk management policies, risk management and compliance training programs and on-going risk assessment activities in the business.
Organizational Structure for Risk Identification, Monitoring and Reporting The Companys organizational structure supports consideration of risk in decision making. The Company monitors its key risks, mitigation plans and its risk management capability through a system of on-going measurement and reporting to business area management, the Chief Enterprise Risk Officer, senior management committees and the Board and its committees. The corporate ERM department designs and facilitates the implementation of methodologies to identify and assess risk, analyze and aggregate risk and mitigation reporting and to evaluate and enhance the risk management culture. Each business area uses these methodologies to identify key risk exposures which are assessed according to potential likelihood and impact, as well as, the quality of the related controls. If appropriate, risk response plans are developed for risks and the business tracks progress against the plans. For significant risks reported to the senior management committees and the Board, specific executives are designated as accountable for the management and monitoring of each such risk. Across the Company, individual business areas utilize Business Risk Offices staffed by associates from the business who oversee implementation of methodologies and tools for risk identification, assessment and reporting. The Companys Corporate Audit Services department also assesses risk and the related quality of internal controls and risk management through its audit activities. Corporate Audit Services reports on the scope and results of its work to the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.
Credit Risk Management Successful management of credit risk, the risk that borrowers may default on their financial obligations to the Company, is critical to the Companys success. There are four primary sources of credit risk: (1)changing economic conditions, which affect customers ability to pay; (2)changing competitive environment, which affects customer debt loads and borrowing patterns; (3)the Companys underwriting strategies and standards, which determine to whom we offer credit and on what terms; and (4)the quality of the Companys internal controls, which establish a process to test that underwriting conforms to Company standards and identify credit quality issues so the Company can act upon them a timely manner. The Company is focused on managing each of these sources of credit risk.
The Companys Chief Credit Officer is charged with overall management of credit risk. The goal is to provide strong central oversight of credit policy and credit programs while maintaining the ability of operating units to respond flexibly to changing market and competitive conditions. The Companys Chief Credit Officer manages a corporate Credit Risk Management staff and chairs the Credit Policy Committee, a committee of senior management. The Credit Policy Committee oversees and approves corporate credit policy and credit 6 Table of Contents performance. Its members include the Chief Credit Officer, the Chief Enterprise Risk Officer, the Controller and the Presidents of the Companys three operating segments. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006, a new banking segment will be disclosed and the President of that segment will be a member of the Credit Policy Committee. The Credit Policy Committee also has sub-committees which provide credit oversight at the divisional level. The Chief Credit Officer, his staff, or the appropriate credit committee reviews and approves all large scale new credit programs. Smaller credit decisions are approved by credit officers appointed by the credit committee(s) and supervised by the Credit Risk Management organization. It is expected that all credit programs will also be approved by the appropriate operating executives. These organizational structures are designed so that each of the Companys business units applies standardized practices in measuring and managing credit risk, and that all relevant factors, such as credit outlook, profitability, and the competitive, economic, and regulatory environment, are considered in making credit decisions.
The Board of Directors has established policies that limit the level and composition of risk in the total lending portfolio. The Companys Credit Policy Committee has established policies that govern credit administration and individual lending decisions. The centralized Credit Risk Management group monitors overall composition and quality of the credit portfolio.
The Companys credit risk profile is managed to maintain resilience to factors outside of the Companys control, strong risk-adjusted returns, and increased diversification.
The Companys guiding principles, strong central governance, and Board-directed credit risk tolerances are designed to keep senior executives well-informed of credit trends so they can make appropriate credit and business decisions for the Company. The Company enhances/preserves day-to-day market responsiveness and flexibility by empowering its business line managers to develop credit strategies and programs aligned with the Companys credit risk policies and objective of long-term business profitability. The credit program development process considers the evolving needs of the target market, the competitive environment, and the economic outlook.
Most of the Companys consumer credit strategies rely heavily on the use of sophisticated proprietary scoring models. These models consider many variables, including credit scores developed by nationally recognized scoring firms. The models are validated, monitored and maintained in accordance with detailed policies and procedures to help maintain their continued validity. The Companys Chief Scoring Officer, a member of the Chief Credit Officers staff, oversees the development, implementation and maintenance of key statistical models.
Liquidity Risk Management Liquidity risk refers to exposures generated from the use and availability of various funding sources to meet its current and future operating needs. The management of liquidity risk is overseen by the Chief Financial Officer with the advice and guidance from the Asset and Liability Management Committee and its sub-committee on funding chaired by the Treasurer. The Company currently manages and mitigates its liquidity risk through the use of a variety of funding sources to establish a maturity pattern that provides a prudent mixture of short-term and long-term funds. See page 54 in Item7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity Risk Management for additional information.
Market Risk Management Market risk refers to exposures generated from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The management of market risk is overseen by the Chief Financial Officer with the advice and guidance from the Asset and Liability Management Committee. The Company currently manages and mitigates its interest rate sensitivity through several techniques, which include, but are not limited to, managing the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities and by entering into interest rate swaps. The Company currently manages 7 Table of Contents and mitigates its exposure to foreign currency exchange risk by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts and cross currency swaps. The hedging of foreign currency exchange rates is limited to certain intercompany obligations related to international operations. See page 56 in Item7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsMarket Risk Management for additional information.
Operational Risk Management Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes, systems, people, or exposure to external events. The management of operational risk is overseen by the Chief Enterprise Risk Officer with the advice and guidance of the ERM Committee.
Operational risk is a normal part of business for any financial services firm. It may manifest itself in many ways, such as fraud by employees or persons outside the Company, business interruptions, errors related to processing and systems, and model errors. The risk of loss includes the potential for legal actions arising as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable laws or regulatory standards. The Company could also suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, not be able to service customers and suffer damages to its reputation.
The key governance forum for operational risk is the ERM Committee, described above. The Committee reviews significant operational risks from business unit self assessments, progress against mitigation plans and analyses of the Companys operational loss event experience. In addition, key risk management initiatives and programs are reviewed by the Committee. Operational risk information is also reported to the Executive Committee and the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. Corporate Audit Services also assesses operational risk and the related quality of internal controls and quality of risk management through its audit activities.
The key tools used in operational risk management are a risk self assessment process, an operational loss event process and economic capital quantification. Key risk exposures are identified by each business area and evaluated according to potential impact and likelihood, as well as the quality of the related controls. If appropriate, risk response plans are developed for certain identified risks and progress is tracked against the plans. Business units are required to conduct self assessments at least annually. Internal loss histories, self assessment results, and data from industry sources are combined with senior managements assessments of future loss rates in a structured scenario approach to quantify economic capital for operational risk. The capital methodology is intended to ensure capital adequacy to withstand extreme events, and to create incentives for business areas to improve their control environments.
There are many specialized activities designed to mitigate key operational risks facing the Company. These include a dedicated fraud management department, programs for third party supplier risk management, information security and business continuity planning, data risk management, and development and maintenance of required policies and procedures. The Company incorporates the output of these functions with its analysis and reporting to senior management to achieve a broad assessment of operational risk levels and trends.
Legal Risk Management Legal risk represents the risk of loss related to (i)new and changed laws and regulations, (ii)interpretations of law, (iii)the Companys legal entity structure and (iv)the drafting of contracts. The management of legal risk, domestically and internationally, is overseen by the Companys General Counsel. The Company operates in a heavily regulated industry, has an evolving corporate structure and relies significantly on certain contractual relationships, all of which contribute to the level of risk the Company faces. The Company also faces risk of loss from litigation, which is primarily managed by the Companys legal department.
8 Table of Contents Strategic Risk Management Strategic risk is the risk to earnings or capital from operating the Company in a competitive environment. The Executive Committee, described above, is the principal management forum for discussion of strategic risk. The Company assesses strategic risk in its annual planning process, which includes both a top-down process set by the Board of Directors and a bottom-up process led by business lines. The Company also performs monthly financial reviews to compare business performance and risk assessments to plan. Consideration of strategic risk is also a vital component of due diligence when evaluating acquisitions or new products, ventures or markets.
Reputation Risk Management Reputation risk represents the risk to: (i)market value; (ii)recruitment and retention of associates; and (iii)maintenance of a loyal customer base based on possible negative perceptions of Capital Ones internal and external stakeholders regarding Capital Ones business strategies and activities. The management of reputation risk is overseen by the Executive Vice President of Corporate Reputation and Governance with the advice and guidance of the Reputation Risk Management Team housed in the Corporate Affairs Department. The Company uses qualitative criteria to assess reputation risk. Various measures, both internal and external, are considered to gauge changes to the Companys reputation and overall reputation risk and include brand market research, customer studies, internal operational loss event data and external measures.
Compliance Risk Management Compliance risk is the risk of non-conformance to laws, rules and regulations. The management of compliance risk is overseen by the Chief Compliance Officer with the advice and guidance of the ERM Committee. The corporate compliance organization, a part of the ERM department, provides the business areas with consulting, training and assistance in the implementation of business processes to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The business areas assess compliance risk through the Companys enterprise risk self assessment process and conduct monitoring and remediation activities for which the compliance organization establishes standards.
Technology / Systems We leverage information technology to achieve our business objectives and to develop and deliver products and services that satisfy our customers needs. A key part of our strategic focus is the development of efficient, flexible computer and operational systems to support complex marketing and account management strategies and the development of new and diversified products. Our commitment to managing risk and ensuring effective controls is built into all of our strategies. We believe that the continued development and integration of these systems is an important part of our efforts to reduce costs, improve quality and provide faster, more flexible technology services. Consequently, we continuously review capabilities and develop or obtain systems, processes and competencies to meet our unique business requirements. As part of our continuous efforts to review and improve our technologies, we may either develop such capabilities internally or rely on third party outsourcers who have the ability to deliver technology that is of higher quality, lower cost, or both. Over time, we have increasingly relied on third party outsourcers to help us deliver systems and operational infrastructure. Consistent with this approach, inAugust 2005 Capital One andTotal System Services Inc.(TSYS)finalized a five year definitive agreementfor TSYSto provide processing services forCapital OnesNorth American portfolio of consumer and small business credit card accounts. The Company believes that its transfer to this new technology platform will allow it to achieve cost savings and product and service flexibility while reducing operational risk.
Funding and Liquidity A discussion of our funding programs and liquidity has been included in Item7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsFunding on pages 51-56.
9 Table of Contents Competition Each of our credit card and other financial products is marketed to specific consumer populations across the credit spectrum. The terms of each product are actively managed to achieve a balance between risk and expected performance. For example, credit card product terms typically include the ability to reprice individual accounts upwards or downwards based on the customers payment and other performance. In addition, since 1998, we have marketed low non-introductory rate cards to consumers with low-risk and established credit profiles to take advantage of the favorable risk return characteristics of this consumer type. Industry competitors have continuously solicited our customers with these and other interest rate strategies. Management believes the competition has put, and will continue to put, additional pressure on our pricing and general product feature strategies.
As a marketer of credit card and other financial products, we face intense competition in all aspects of our business from numerous bank and non-bank providers of financial services. Some of these companies are substantially larger and have more resources than we do. In addition, our industry has experienced substantial consolidation and may continue to do so; this consolidation continues to create competitors who are larger and have more resources than we do. In addition, such consolidated and/or larger competitors may have a more diversified product and customer base, operational efficiencies and more versatile technology platforms than we do. Consolidation has, and may continue, to increase competitive pressures on both us and other companies in our industry.
We compete with international, national, regional and local issuers of Visa  and MasterCard  credit cards. In addition, American Express  , Discover Card  and, to a certain extent, smart cards and debit cards, represent additional competition to the general purpose credit card. In general, customers are attracted to credit card issuers largely on the basis of price, credit limit and other product features, and customer loyalty is often limited.
In motor vehicle finance, we face competition from banks and non-bank lenders who provide financing for dealer-originated loans. We also face competition from a small, but growing number of online automobile finance providers.
The National Bank competes with national and state banks for deposits, loans and trust accounts and with savings and loan associations and credit unions for loans and deposits. The National Bank also competes with other financial services providers, both inside and outside Louisiana and Texas, for loans, deposits, investments, insurance and other services and products. Additionally, we compete against other lending institutions in our healthcare financing and mortgage lending businesses.
We believe that we are able to compete effectively in both our current and new markets. There can be no assurance, however, that our ability to market products and services successfully or to obtain adequate yield on our loans will not be impacted by the nature of the competition that now exists or may later develop. In addition, some of our competitors may be substantially larger than we are, which may give those competitors advantages, including a more diversified product and customer base, operational efficiencies, broad-based local distribution capabilities, lower cost funding and more versatile technology platforms. These competitors may also consolidate with other financial institutions in ways that enhance these advantages.
Intellectual Property As part of our overall and ongoing strategy to protect and enhance our intellectual property, we rely on a variety of protections, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents and certain restrictions on disclosure. We also undertake other measures to control access to and distribution of our other proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use certain intellectual property or proprietary information without authorization. Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information. In addition, our competitors also file patent 10 Table of Contents applications for innovations that are used in our industry. The ability of our competitors to obtain such patents may adversely affect our ability to compete. Conversely, our ability to obtain such patents may increase our competitive advantage. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in such efforts, or that the ability of our competitors to obtain such patents may not adversely impact our financial results.
Employees As of December31, 2005, we employed approximately 21,000 employees whom we refer to as associates. A central part of our philosophy is to attract and maintain a highly capable staff. We view current associate relations to be satisfactory. None of our associates is covered under a collective bargaining agreement.
Supervision and Regulation General The Corporation is a bank holding company (BHC) under Section3 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHC Act) (12 U.S.C.  1842). The Corporation is subject to the requirements of the BHC Act, including its capital adequacy standards and limitations on the Corporations nonbanking activities, and to supervision, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board (the Federal Reserve). Permissible activities for a BHC include those activities that are so closely related to banking as to be incident thereto such as consumer lending and other activities that have been approved by the Federal Reserve by regulation or order. Certain servicing activities are also permissible for a BHC if conducted for or on behalf of the BHC or any of its affiliates. Impermissible activities for BHCs include activities that are related to commerce such as retail sales of nonfinancial products. Under Federal Reserve policy, the Corporation is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to any banks that it controls, including the Bank, the National Bank and the Savings Bank (the Banks), and to commit resources to support them.
On May27, 2005, the Corporation became a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act amendments to the BHC Act (the GLBA). The GLBA removed many of the restrictions on the activities of BHCs that become financial holding companies. A financial holding company, and the non-bank companies under its control, are permitted to engage in activities considered financial in nature (including, for example, insurance underwriting, agency sales and brokerage, securities underwriting, dealing and brokerage and merchant banking activities); incidental to financial activities; or complementary to financial activities if the Federal Reserve determines that they pose no risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system in general.
The Corporations election to become a financial holding company under the GLBA certifies that the depository institutions the Corporation controls meet certain criteria, including capital, management and Community Reinvestment Act requirements. If the Corporation were to fail to continue to meet the criteria for financial holding company status, it could, depending on which requirements it failed to meet, face restrictions on new financial activities or acquisitions and/or be required to discontinue existing activities that are not generally permissible for bank holding companies.
The Bank is a banking corporation chartered under Virginia law and a member of the Federal Reserve System, the deposits of which are insured by the Bank Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) up to applicable limits. In addition to regulatory requirements imposed as a result of the Banks international operations (discussed below), the Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the Bureau of Financial Institutions of the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the Bureau of Financial Institutions), the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (FRB-R) and the FDIC.
The National Bank is a nationally chartered bank, the deposits of which are insured by the Bank Insurance Fund of the FDIC up to applicable limits. The National Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC) and the FDIC.
11 Table of Contents The Savings Bank is a federal savings bank chartered by the Office of Thrift Supervision (the OTS) and is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Its deposits are insured by the Savings Association Insurance Fund of the FDIC up to applicable limits. The Savings Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the OTS and the FDIC.
The Corporation is also registered as a financial institution holding company under Virginia law and as such is subject to periodic examination by Virginias Bureau of Financial Institutions. The Corporations automobile financing activities, conducted by COAF and its subsidiaries, fall under the scrutiny of the Federal Reserve and the state agencies having supervisory authority under applicable sales finance laws or consumer finance laws in most states. The Corporation also faces regulation in the international jurisdictions in which it conducts business.
Dividends and Transfers of Funds Dividends to the Corporation from its direct and indirect subsidiaries represent a major source of funds for the Corporation to pay dividends on its stock, make payments on its debt securities and meet its other obligations. There are various federal and state law limitations on the extent to which the Banks can finance or otherwise supply funds to the Corporation through dividends, loans or otherwise. These limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements, federal and state banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W there under governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates, and general federal and state regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices. In general, federal banking laws prohibit, without first obtaining regulatory approval, insured depository institutions, such as the Banks, from making dividend distributions if such distributions are not paid out of available earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet applicable capital adequacy standards. Under OTS regulations, other limitations apply to the Savings Banks ability to pay dividends, the magnitude of which depends upon the extent to which the Savings Bank meets its regulatory capital requirements. In addition, under Virginia law, the Bureau of Financial Institutions may limit the payment of dividends by the Bank if the Bureau of Financial Institutions determines that such a limitation would be in the public interest and necessary for the Banks safety and soundness.
Capital Adequacy The Company, the Bank, the Savings Bank, and the National Bank (the Banks) are subject to capital adequacy guidelines adopted by federal banking regulators. For a further discussion of the capital adequacy guidelines, see page 58 in Item7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCapital Adequacy and pages 105-106 in Item8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 18Regulatory Matters. The Banks were well capitalized under these guidelines as of December31, 2005.
Basel Committee On May11, 2004, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Committee) announced that it has achieved consensus on the new Basel Capital Accord (Basel II), which proposes establishment of a new framework of capital adequacy for banking organizations; the Committee published the text of the framework on July26, 2004. Despite the release of the Basel II framework, it is not clear at this time whether and in what manner the new accord will be adopted by bank regulators with respect to banking organizations that they supervise and regulate. In April 2005, federal banking regulators in the United States announced a delay in their release of proposed rulemaking in this regard. Proposed rulemaking in the United States is now expected in mid-2006, and final rules are expected to become effective prior to January1, 2008, when banks to which the rules will apply must begin parallel running of the new capital regulations and the existing capital regulations. As the rules are currently proposed, compliance with the rules by the Company would not be mandatory. This timeline continues to be subject to change.
Although the Committees stated intent is that Basel II will not change the amount of overall capital in the global banking system, adoption of the proposed new accord could require individual banking organizations, including 12 Table of Contents the Company, to increase the minimum level of capital held. The Company will continue to closely monitor regulatory action on this matter and assess the potential impact to the Company.
The federal banking regulators in the United States have also released an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that seeks comments on potential amendments to the existing regulatory capital regulations in the United States (Basel 1A). This rulemaking is expected to proceed along a timeline similar to the timeline for the rulemaking that will implement Basel II in the US. The Company will continue to closely monitor regulatory action on this matter and assess the potential impact to the Company.
FDICIA Among other things, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) requires federal bank regulatory authorities to take prompt corrective action (PCA) with respect to insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital ratio levels: well-capitalized, adequately-capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. As of December31, 2005, each of the Banks met the requirements for a well-capitalized institution. The well-capitalized classification is determined solely for the purposes of applying FDICIAs PCA provisions, as discussed below, and should not be viewed as describing the condition or future prospects of a depository institution, including the Banks. Were any of the Banks to lose their status as well-capitalized they could be required to increase capital or lose access to deposits.
The Banks may accept brokered deposits as part of their funding. Under FDICIA, only well-capitalized and adequately-capitalized institutions may accept brokered deposits. Adequately-capitalized institutions, however, must first obtain a waiver from the FDIC before accepting brokered deposits, and such deposits may not pay rates that significantly exceed the rates paid on deposits of similar maturity from the institutions normal market area or the national rate on deposits of comparable maturity, as determined by the FDIC, for deposits from outside the institutions normal market area.
Liability for Commonly-Controlled Institutions Under the cross-guarantee provision of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), insured depository institutions such as the Banks may be liable to the FDIC with respect to any loss incurred or reasonably anticipated to be incurred, by the FDIC in connection with the default of, or FDIC assistance to, any commonly controlled insured depository institution. The Banks are commonly controlled within the meaning of the FIRREA cross-guarantee provision.
Investment Limitation and Qualified Thrift Lender Test Federally-chartered savings banks such as the Savings Bank are subject to certain investment limitations. For example, federal savings banks are not permitted to make consumer loans (i.e., certain open-end or closed-end loans for personal, family or household purposes, excluding credit card loans) in excess of 35% of the savings banks assets. Federal savings banks are also required to meet the QTL Test, which generally requires a savings bank to maintain at least 65% portfolio assets (total assets less (i)specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, (ii)intangibles, including goodwill and (iii)property used to conduct business) in certain qualified thrift investments (residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage backed and mortgage related investments, small business related securities, certain state and federal housing investments, education loans and credit card loans) on a monthly basis in nine out of every twelve months. Failure to qualify under the QTL Test could subject the Savings Bank to substantial restrictions on its activities, including the activity restrictions that apply generally to bank holding companies and their affiliates and potential loss of grandfathered rights under the GLB Act. As of December31, 2005, 76% of the Savings Banks portfolio assets were held in qualified thrift investments, and the Savings Bank was in compliance with the QTL Test.
13 Table of Contents Subprime Lending Guidelines On January31, 2001, the federal banking agencies issued Expanded Guidance for Subprime Lending Programs (the Guidelines). The Guidelines, while not constituting a formal regulation, provide guidance to the federal bank examiners regarding the adequacy of capital and loan loss reserves held by insured depository institutions engaged in subprime lending. The Guidelines adopted a broad definition of subprime loans which likely covers more than one-third of all consumers in the United States. Because our business strategy is to provide credit card products and other consumer loans to a wide range of consumers, we believe that a portion of our loan assets are viewed by the examiners as subprime. Thus, under the Guidelines, bank examiners could require the Bank or the Savings Bank to hold additional capital (from one and one-half to three times the minimally required level of capital, as set forth in the Guidelines), or additional loan loss reserves, against such assets. As described above, as of December31, 2005 the Bank and the Savings Bank each met the requirements for a well-capitalized institution. Federal examiners, however, have wide discretion as to how to apply the Guidelines and there can be no assurances that the Bank or the Savings Bank may not be required to hold additional regulatory capital against such assets.
For purposes of the Subprime Guidelines, we treat as subprime all loans in the Banks and the Savings Banks programs that are targeted at customers either with a Fair, Isaac and Company (FICO) score of 660 or below or with no FICO score. The Bank and the Savings Bank hold on average 200% of the total risk-based capital requirement that would otherwise apply to such assets.
FFIEC Account Management Guidance On January8, 2003, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) released Account Management and Loss Allowance Guidance (the Guidance). The Guidance applies to all credit lending of regulated financial institutions and generally requires that banks properly manage several elements of their credit card lending programs, including line assignments, over-limit practices, minimum payment and negative amortization, workout and settlement programs, and the accounting methodology used for various assets and income items related to credit card loans.
We believe that our credit card account management and loss allowance practices are prudent and appropriate and, therefore, consistent with the Guidance. We caution, however, that similar to the subprime Guidelines, the Guidance provides wide discretion to bank regulatory agencies in the application of the Guidance to any particular institution and its account management and loss allowance practices. Accordingly, under the Guidance, bank examiners could require changes in our account management or loss allowance practices in the future, and such changes could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operation.
Regulation of Lending Activities The activities of the Banks as consumer lenders also are subject to regulation under various federal laws, including the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the FCRA), the Community Reinvestment Act and the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act, as well as under various state laws. Depending on the underlying issue and applicable law, regulators are often authorized to impose penalties for violations of these statutes and, in certain cases, to order the Banks to compensate injured borrowers. Borrowers may also have a private right of action to bring actions for certain violations. Federal bankruptcy and state debtor relief and collection laws also affect the ability of the Banks to collect outstanding balances owed by borrowers. These laws plus state sales finance laws also affect the ability of our automobile financing business to collect outstanding balances.
Privacy and Fair Credit Reporting The GLB Act requires a financial institution to disclose its privacy policy to customers and consumers, and requires that such customers or consumers be given a choice (through an opt-out notice) to forbid the sharing of 14 Table of Contents nonpublic personal information about them with nonaffiliated third persons. The Corporation and the Banks each have a written privacy notice which is posted on the web site of the Corporation or Hibernia, as applicable, and delivered to each of its customers when customer relationships begin, and annually thereafter, in compliance with the GLB Act. In accordance with the privacy notice, the Corporation and the Banks protect the security of information about their customers, educate their employees about the importance of protecting customer privacy, and allow their customers to remove their names from the solicitation lists they use and share with others. The Corporation and the Banks require business partners with whom they share such information to have adequate security safeguards and to abide by the redisclosure and reuse provisions of the GLB Act. The Corporation and the Banks have developed and implemented programs to fulfill the expressed requests of customers and consumers to opt out of information sharing subject to the GLB Act. In addition to adopting federal requirements regarding privacy, the GLB Act also permits individual states to enact stricter laws relating to the use of customer information. California, Vermont and North Dakota, among others, have done so by statute, regulation or referendum, and other states may consider proposals which impose additional requirements or restrictions on the Corporation and/or the Bank. If the federal or state regulators of the financial subsidiaries establish further guidelines for addressing customer privacy issues, the Corporation and/or the Banks may need to amend their privacy policies and adapt their internal procedures.
Like other lending institutions, the Banks utilize credit bureau data in their underwriting activities. Use of such data is regulated under the FCRA on a uniform, nationwide basis, including credit reporting, prescreening, sharing of information between affiliates, and the use of credit data. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (the FACT Act), which was enacted by Congress and signed into law in December 2003, extends the federal preemption of the FCRA permanently, although the law authorizes states to enact identity theft laws that are not inconsistent with the conduct required by the provisions of the FACT Act. If financial institutions and credit bureaus fail to alleviate the costs and consumer frustration associated with the growing crime of identity theft, financial institutions could face increased legislative/regulatory and litigation risks. In addition, federal regulators are still in the process of promulgating regulations under the FACT Act; there can be no assurance that such regulations, when enacted, will not have an adverse impact on the Company.
Investment in the Corporation and the Banks Certain acquisitions of capital stock may be subject to regulatory approval or notice under federal or state law. Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire shares of capital stock of the Corporation in excess of the amount which can be acquired without regulatory approval. Each of the Banks is an insured depository institution within the meaning of the Change in Bank Control Act. Consequently, federal law and regulations prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of the Corporation without, in most cases, prior written approval of the Federal Reserve, the OCC or the OTS, as applicable. Control is conclusively presumed if, among other things, a person or company acquires more than 25% of any class of voting stock of the Corporation. A rebuttable presumption of control arises if a person or company acquires more than 10% of any class of voting stock and is subject to any of a number of specified control factors as set forth in the applicable regulations. Additionallly, the Bank is a bank within the meaning of Chapter 13 of Title 6.1 of the Code of Virginia governing the acquisition of interests in Virginia financial institutions (the Financial Institution Holding Company Act). The Financial Institution Holding Company Act prohibits any person or entity from acquiring, or making any public offer to acquire, control of a Virginia financial institution or its holding company without making application to, and receiving prior approval from, the Bureau of Financial Institutions.
Non-Bank Activities The Corporations non-bank subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various other federal and state authorities. Insurance agency subsidiaries are regulated by state insurance regulatory agencies in the states in which they operate. Hibernia Asset Management, L.L.C. and Hibernia Investments, L.L.C. are registered investment advisers regulated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Hibernia Asset Management provides investment advice to investment companies subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
15 Table of Contents Hibernia Investments and Hibernia Southcoast Capital, Inc. are registered broker-dealers regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and the Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions through the Deputy Commissioner of Securities. The Companys broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to, among other things, net capital rules designed to measure the general financial condition and liquidity of a broker-dealer. Under these rules, broker-dealers are required to maintain the minimum net capital deemed necessary to meet their continuing commitments to customers and others, and are required to keep a substantial portion of their assets in relatively liquid form. These rules also limit the ability of broker-dealers to transfer large amounts of capital to parent companies and other affiliates. Broker-dealers are also subject to other regulations covering their business operations, including sales and trading practices, public offerings, publication of research reports, use and safekeeping of client funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.
USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 On October26, 2001, the President signed into law the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act). The Patriot Act contains sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws as well as enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanics for the U.S. government, including: due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer, maintain, or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non-U.S. persons; standards for verifying customer identification at account opening; rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering; reports by nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with the Treasury Departments Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for transactions exceeding $10,000; and filing suspicious activities reports by brokers and dealers if they believe a customer may be violating U.S. laws and regulations.
The Department of Treasury in consultation with the Federal Reserve and other federal financial institution regulators has promulgated rules and regulations implementing the Patriot Act which: prohibit U.S. correspondent accounts with foreign banks that have no physical presence in any jurisdiction; require financial institutions to maintain certain records for correspondent accounts of foreign banks; require financial institutions to produce certain records relating to anti-money laundering compliance upon request of the appropriate federal banking agency; require due diligence with respect to private banking and correspondent banking accounts; facilitate information sharing between government and financial institutions; require verification of customer identification; and require financial institutions to have in place an anti-money laundering program.
Interstate Taxation Several states have passed legislation which attempts to tax the income from interstate financial activities, including credit cards, derived from accounts held by local state residents. Based on the volume of our business in these states and the nature of the legislation passed to date, we currently believe that this development will not materially affect our financial condition.
Legislation Legislation has been enacted requiring additional disclosures for credit cards and other types of consumer lending. Such legislation places additional restrictions on the practices of credit card issuers and consumer lenders generally. In addition to the FCRA and FACT Act provisions discussed above, Congress has enacted broad changes to the federal Bankruptcy code, including a sweeping reform of the consumer bankruptcy provisions which, while instituting a means test for individuals filing under chapter 13 and enacting other reforms, also requires credit card issuers to provide regular disclosures to customers of the financial effect of regularly making only the minimum required payment on their accounts. Additionally, deposit insurance reform legislation has just been enacted and must now be implemented by the FDIC. Also, proposals have been made to restrict certain consumer lending practices and expand the privacy protections afforded to customers of financial 16 Table of Contents institutions. It is unclear at this time whether and in what form any legislation will be adopted or, if adopted, what its impact on the Bank, the Savings Bank, the National Bank, COAF or the Corporation would be. Congress or individual states may in the future consider other legislation that would materially and/or adversely affect the banking or consumer lending industries.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance On July30, 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) was passed into law. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act applies to all companies that are required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and contains a number of significant changes relating to the responsibilities of directors and officers and reporting and governance obligations of SEC reporting companies. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the PCAOB), a private sector, non-profit corporation whose mission is to oversee the auditors of public companies. The PCAOB recommends rulemaking to the SEC and sets certain standards for the auditors which it oversees. Since the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Company has taken a variety of steps which it believes place it in substantial compliance with the effective provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company continues to monitor SEC rulemaking and PCAOB activities to determine if additional changes are needed to comply with provisions that may become effective in the future. Furthermore, the Companys management has supervised the design of, or has designed, internal controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information regarding the Company is made known to them, particularly during the period in which this Annual Report on Form 10-K is being prepared and has evaluated the effectiveness of those controls as more fully set forth in Controls and Procedures below. The Company has, in compliance with Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, certified, in connection with this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that it did not discover, during the execution of its internal control processes, any material weaknesses. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting excludes the evaluation of the internal controls over financial reporting of Hibernia Corporation and its subsidiaries, which were acquired on November16, 2005. In addition, the Companys management policy is to disclose to the Companys auditors and the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors significant deficiencies, if any, in the design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting, which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, as well as any fraud, whether or not material, by those that have a significant role in these processes.
International Regulation The Bank also faces regulation in foreign jurisdictions where it currently, and may in the future, operate. Those regulations may be similar to or substantially different from the regulatory requirements the Bank faces in the United States. In the United Kingdom, the Bank operates through the U.K. Bank, which was established in 2000. The U.K. Bank is regulated by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and licensed by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). The U.K. Bank is an authorized deposit taker and thus is able to take consumer deposits in the U.K. The U.K. Bank has also been granted a full license by the OFT to issue consumer credit under the U.K.s Consumer Credit Act1974. The FSA requires the U.K. Bank to maintain certain regulatory capital ratios at all times. The U.K. Bank obtains capital through earnings or through additional capital infusion from the Bank, subject to approval under Regulation K of the rules administered by the Federal Reserve. If the U.K. Bank is unable to generate sufficient capital in favorable terms, it may choose to restrict its growth to maintain its required capital levels. In addition, the U.K. Bank is limited by the U.K. Companies Act1985 in its distribution of dividends to the Bank in that such dividends may only be paid out of the U.K. Banks distributable profits.
As in the U.S., in non-U.S. jurisdictions where we operate, we face a risk that the laws and regulations that are applicable to us (or the interpretations of existing laws by relevant regulators) may change in ways that adversely impact our business. In the United Kingdom, in connection with the December 2003 Government report, Fair, Clear and Competitive: The Consumer Credit Market in the 21 st Century, the introduction of the Consumer 17 Table of Contents Credit (Amendment) Bill in Parliament was confirmed on November23, 2004. The Bill is likely to come into force in April 2006 and is expected to cover the following areas: the creation of an unfair relationship test for credit agreements, the creation of alternative dispute resolution options for credit agreements, a requirement on lenders to provide annual statements to borrowers outlining the full amount owed and warnings about making only minimum repayments, and a stricter licensing regime that would give the OFT new powers to fine lenders for their behavior. At this time, we cannot predict the extent to which the provisions of the draft bill will remain in the final statute, or, if implemented, how such changes would impact us. In addition, there is a current examination by the OFT of whether the levels of interchange paid by retailers in respect of MasterCard credit and charge cards in the U.K. are too high. The OFT has also launched a similar investigation into Visa interchange fees. The preliminary conclusion of the MasterCard examination is that the levels of interchange are too high which could, if not changed or if agreement is reached on a lower level of interchange, adversely affect the yield on U.K. credit card portfolios, including ours, and could therefore adversely impact our earnings. Other U.K. legal developments include communications with the OFT as to its interpretation of consumer credit law which could lead to changes in the lending agreements from time to time. The OFT is carrying out an industry wide investigation into alleged unfair contract terms in lending agreements and questioning how credit card companies calculate default charges, such as late, overlimit and returned check fees, in the U.K. The OFT asserts that the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 render unenforceable consumer lending agreement terms relating to default charges to the extent that the charge is disproportionately high in relation to the actual cost of the default to the companies. The OFT may seek an agreement with the companies to change their practices or, if this is not possible, may obtain a court injunction to prevent the continued use of the alleged unfair term. In July 2005, the Company received a letter from the OFT indicating the OFT had reached a provisional conclusion that the levels of default charges the credit card companies impose are excessive. The OFT also issued a press release the following day indicating that it had written to eight major credit card companies to consult on its provisional conclusion. The OFT had at that time, given the credit card companies three months in which to provide suitable undertakings or otherwise to address the concerns it has raised. Discussions between the OFT and the Company continue to be ongoing and the OFT has now indicated it may instead issue a statement of principles; it is unclear at this time in what the principles might state or in what way the principles might impact the Company. In the event the OFTs view prevails, the Companys default charges in the U.K. could be significantly reduced. In addition, should the OFT prevail in its challenge, the Company may also be subject to claims from customers seeking reimbursement of default charges. The Company is assessing the OFT challenge and cannot state what its eventual outcome will be. Any potential impact could vary based on business strategies or other actions the Company takes to attempt to limit the impact.

Risk Factor s.
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. We also may make written or oral forward-looking statements in our periodic reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, in our annual report to shareholders, in our proxy statements, in our offering circulars and prospectuses, in press releases and other written materials and in statements made by our officers, directors or employees to third parties. Statements that are not about historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include information relating to our future earnings per share, growth in managed loans outstanding, product mix, segment growth, managed revenue margin, funding costs, operations costs, employment growth, marketing expense, delinquencies and charge-offs. Forward-looking statements also include statements using words such as expect, anticipate, hope, intend, plan, believe, estimate, target or similar expressions. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current plans, estimates and projections, and you should not unduly rely on them.
Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including the risks discussed below. Our future performance and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Many of the factors that will determine these results and values are beyond our ability to control or predict. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should carefully consider the factors discussed below in evaluating these forward-looking statements.
This section highlights specific risks that could affect our business and us. Although we have tried to discuss key factors, please be aware that other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our financial performance. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, among the other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: We Face Intense Competition in All of Our Markets We face intense competition from many other providers of credit cards, automobile loans, retail banking services and other consumer financial products and services. In particular, in our credit card activities, we compete with international, national, regional and local bank card issuers, with other general purpose credit or charge card issuers, and to a certain extent, issuers of smart cards and debit cards. Our credit card business also competes with providers of other types of financial services and consumer loans such as home equity lines and other mortgage related products that offer consumer debt consolidation. Thus, the cost to acquire new accounts will continue to vary among product lines and may rise. Other companies may compete with us for customers by offering lower initial interest rates and fees, higher credit limits and/or customer services or product features that are or may appear to be more attractive than those we offer. Because customers often choose credit card issuers (or other sources of financing) based on price (primarily interest rates and fees), credit limit and other product features, customer loyalty is limited. In addition, intense competition may lead to product and pricing practices that may adversely impact long-term customer loyalty; we may choose to not engage in such practices, which may adversely impact our ability to compete, particularly in the short term. Increased competition has resulted in, and may continue to cause, a decrease in credit card response rates and reduced productivity of marketing dollars invested in certain lines of business. Competition may also have an impact on customer attrition as our customers accept offers from other credit card lenders and/or providers of other consumer lending products, such as home equity financing.
Our other consumer lending businesses, including auto lending, small business lending, home loan lending, installment lending, our commercial lending businesses, and our businesses in international markets also compete on a similar variety of factors, including price, product features and customer service. These businesses may also experience a decline in marketing efficiency and/or an increase in customer attrition. Additionally, the National 19 Table of Contents Bank competes with national and state banks for deposits, loans, and trust accounts, and also competes with other financial services companies in offering various types of financial services.
Some of our competitors may be substantially larger than we are, which may give those competitors advantages, including a more diversified product and customer base, operational efficiencies, broad-based local distribution capabilities, lower-cost funding and more versatile technology platforms. These competitors may also consolidate with other financial institutions in ways that enhance these advantages and intensify our competitive environment.
In such a competitive environment, we may lose entire accounts, or may lose account balances, to competing financial institutions, or find it more costly to maintain our existing customer base. Customer attrition from any or all of our lending products, together with any lowering of interest rates or fees that we might implement to retain customers, could reduce our revenues and therefore our earnings. Similarly, customer attrition from our deposit products, in addition to an increase of rates an/or services that we may undertake to retain those deposits, may increase our expenses and therefore reduce our earnings. We expect that competition will continue to grow more intense with respect to most of our products, including our diversified products and the products we offer internationally.
We May Experience Increased Delinquencies and Credit Losses Like other lenders, we face the risk that our customers will not repay their loans. Rising losses or leading indicators of rising losses (higher delinquencies or bankruptcy rates; lower collateral values) may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may degrade our profitability if we are unable to raise revenue or reduce costs to compensate for higher losses. In addition, higher losses may adversely affect the performance of our securitizations, may increase our cost of funds, and may limit our access to financial markets. In particular, we face the following risks in this area:  Missed Payments . We face the risk that customers will miss payments. Loan charge-offs are generally preceded by missed payments or other indications of worsening financial condition. Our reported delinquency levels measure these trends. In some instances, customers declare bankruptcy without first missing payments. We usually charge-off at least a portion of a customers outstanding loan balance in the case of bankruptcy. Our bankruptcy experience is correlated with national bankruptcy filing trends.
Collateral.
We face the risk that collateral, when we have it, will be insufficient to compensate us for loan losses. When customers default on their loans and we have collateral, we attempt to seize it. However, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from our customers. Our automobile loans are subject to collateral risk through declining used car prices. Our commercial and real-estate exposures are also subject to collateral risk, especially those that were affected by Hurricane Katrina.
Estimates of future losses . We face the risk that we may underestimate our future losses and fail to hold a loan loss allowance sufficient to account for these losses. We update our forecast of future losses and analyze certain scenarios each quarter. We incorporate these estimates into our financial plans, strategies, loan loss allowance, and forward looking statements. These estimates are based on observed trends in delinquency, charge-offs, bankruptcies, and collateral recoveries; on our marketing strategies and underwriting models; and on our views about future economic, interest rate, and competitive conditions. Incorrect assumptions could lead to material underestimates of future losses.
Underwriting.
We face the risk that our ability to assess the credit worthiness of our customers may diminish. We market our products to a wide range of customers including those with less experience with credit products and those with a history of missed payments. We select our customers, manage their accounts and establish prices and credit limits using proprietary models and other techniques 20 Table of Contents designed to predict future charge-offs. Our goal is to set prices and credit limits such that we are appropriately compensated for the credit risk we accept for both high and low risk customers. If the models and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future charge-offs (due, for example, to changes in the competitive environment or in the economy), our credit losses and returns may deteriorate.
Business mix . We face the risk that our business mix will change in ways that could adversely affect credit losses. We participate in a mix of businesses with a broad range of credit loss characteristics. Consequently, changes in segment mix may change our charge-off rate. In addition, significant changes in our organic growth rate may change our charge-off rate since young accounts tend to have lower charge-offs than older accounts (i.e. slower organic growth may drive a higher charge-off rate).
Charge-off recognition . We face the risk that the rules governing charge-off recognition could change. We record charge-offs according to accounting practices consistent with accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules. These guidelines and rules, including among other things, the FFIEC Account Management Guidance, could change and cause our charge-offs to increase for reasons unrelated to the underlying performance of our portfolio.
Industry practices . We face the risk that our charge-off and delinquency rates may be impacted by industry developments. For example, actions by our competitors to change minimum payment practices in response to advice from the regulators regarding the application of FFIEC Account Management Guidance may adversely impact industry charge-off and delinquency rates and, in turn, our rates.
We Face Risk From Economic Downturns Delinquencies and credit losses in the consumer finance industry generally increase during economic downturns or recessions. Likewise, consumer demand may decline during an economic downturn or recession. In the United States, we face the risk that the effects of higher energy costs, higher interest rates, pressure on housing prices and hurricane damages may weaken the economys labor markets. Accordingly, an economic downturn in the United States (either local or national), can hurt our financial performance as accountholders default on their loans or, in the case of credit card accounts, carry lower balances and reduce credit card purchase activity. Furthermore, because our business model is to lend across the credit spectrum, we make loans to lower credit quality customers. These customers generally have higher rates of charge-offs and delinquencies than do higher credit quality customers. Additionally, we face the risk that the recession and downturn in consumer credit in the United Kingdom may continue to worsen, which, could also hurt our financial performance.
We Face Strategic Risks in Sustaining Our Growth and Pursuing Diversification Our growth strategy has multiple components. First, we seek to continue to grow our established businesses, such as our domestic credit card and automobile finance businesses. Second, we hope to continue to diversify our business, both geographically and in product mix. We seek to do this by growing our lending businesses, including credit cards, internationally, principally in the United Kingdom and Canada, and by identifying, pursuing and expanding new business opportunities, such as branch banking and other consumer loan products. Our acquisition of Hibernia enabled us to expand into the branch banking business, which we believe can be a growth business for the Company, and is a key component of our ongoing diversification strategy. Our ability to continue to grow is driven by the success of our fundamental business plan, the level of our investments in new businesses or regions and our ability to apply our risk management skills to new businesses. This risk has many components, including:  Customer and Account Growth.
Our growth is highly dependent on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new ones, grow existing and new account balances, develop new market segments and have sufficient funding available for marketing activities to generate these customers and account balances. Our ability to grow and retain customers is also dependent on customer satisfaction, which 21 Table of Contents may be adversely affected by factors outside of our control, such as postal service and other marketing and customer service channel disruptions and costs.
Product and Marketing Development.
Difficulties or delays in the development, production, testing and marketing of new products or services, which may be caused by a number of factors including, among other things, operational constraints, technology functionality, regulatory and other capital requirements and legal difficulties, will affect the success of such products or services and can cause losses arising from the costs to develop unsuccessful products and services, as well as decreased capital availability. In addition, customers may not accept the new products and services offered.
Diversification Risk.
An important element of our strategy is our effort to continue diversifying beyond our U.S. credit card business. Our ability to successfully diversify is impacted by a number of factors, including: identifying appropriate acquisition targets, entering into successful negotiations with such targets and executing on acquisition transactions, successfully integrating acquired businesses, including Hibernia, developing and executing strategies to grow our existing consumer financial services businesses, and our financial ability to undertake these diversification activities. In addition, part of our diversification strategy has been to grow internationally. Our growth internationally faces additional challenges, including limited access to information, differences in cultural attitudes toward borrowing, changing regulatory and legislative environments, political developments, possible economic downturns in other countries exchange rates and differences from the historical experience of portfolio performance in the United States and other countries.
We May Fail To Realize All of the Anticipated Benefits of our Merger with Hibernia Corporation.
The success of the merger will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of Capital One and Hibernia. However, to realize these anticipated benefits, we must successfully combine the businesses of Capital One and Hibernia. If we are not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger, such as cost savings and other synergies, may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.
Prior to the completion of the merger, Capital One and Hibernia operated independently. It is possible that the ongoing integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each companys ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. Integration efforts between the two companies will also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the Company during such transition period.
Reputational Risk and Social Factors May Impact our Results Our ability to originate and maintain accounts is highly dependent upon consumer and other external perceptions of our business practices and/or our financial health. Adverse perceptions regarding our business practices and/or our financial health could damage our reputation in both the customer and funding markets, leading to difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them. Adverse developments with respect to the consumer or other external perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, may also adversely impact our reputation. In addition, adverse reputational impacts on third parties with whom we have important relationships, such as our independent auditors, may also adversely impact our reputation. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry, may also result in greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations that may change or constrain the manner in which we engage with our customers and the products we offer them. Adverse reputational impacts or events may also increase our litigation risk. See We Face the Risk of a Complex and Changing Regulatory and Legal Environment below. To this end, we carefully monitor internal and external developments for areas of potential reputational risk and have established governance structures to assist in evaluating such risks in our business practices and decisions.
22 Table of Contents In addition, a variety of social factors may cause changes in credit card and other consumer finance use, payment patterns and the rate of defaults by accountholders and borrowers. These social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels, the publics perception of the use of credit cards and other consumer debt, and changing attitudes about incurring debt and the stigma of personal bankruptcy.
We Face Risk Related to the Strength of our Operational, Technological and Organizational Infrastructure Our ability to grow and compete is dependent on our ability to build or acquire the necessary operational and technological infrastructure and to manage the cost of that infrastructure while we expand. Similar to other large corporations, in our case, operational risk can manifest itself in many ways, such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes, faulty or disabled computer systems, fraud by employees or persons outside of Capital One and exposure to external events. We are dependent on our operational infrastructure to help manage these risks. In addition, we are heavily dependent on the strength and capability of our technology systems which we use both to interface with our customers and to manage our internal financial and other systems. Our ability to develop and deliver new products that meet the needs of our existing customers and attract new ones depends on the functionality of our technology systems. Our ability to develop and implement effective marketing campaigns also depends on our technology. Additionally, our ability to run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations is dependent on these infrastructures.
We continuously monitor our operational and technological capabilities and make modifications and improvements when we believe it will be cost effective to do so. In some instances, we may build and maintain these capabilities ourselves. We also outsource some of these functions to third parties. These third parties may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control. As we increase the amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to third parties, we increase our exposure to this risk. We also face risk from the integration of new infrastructure platforms and/or new third party providers of such platforms into our existing businesses. We are currently undertaking a project with Total System Services, Inc. (TSYS) to transfer to a new technological platform that will result in TSYS providing processing services for Capital Ones North American portfolio of consumer and small business credit card accounts. Our ability to successfully transition to this new platform as well as TSYSs ongoing ability to provide services to us, could impact our performance in the future.
In addition to creating a solid infrastructure platform, we are also dependent on recruiting management and operations personnel with the experience to run an increasingly large and complex business. Although we take steps to retain our existing management talent and recruit new talent as needed, we face a competitive market for such talent and there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to maintain and build a management team capable of running our increasingly large and complex business.
We May Face Limited Availability of Financing, Variation in Our Funding Costs and Uncertainty in Our Securitization Financing In general, the amount, type and cost of our funding, including financing from other financial institutions, the capital markets and deposits, directly impacts our expense in operating our business and growing our assets and therefore, can positively or negatively affect our financial results.
A number of factors could make such financing more difficult, more expensive or unavailable on any terms both domestically and internationally (where funding transactions may be on terms more or less favorable than in the United States), including, but not limited to, financial results and losses, changes within our organization, specific events that adversely impact our reputation, changes in the activities of our business partners, disruptions in the capital markets, specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry, counter-party availability, changes affecting our assets, our corporate and regulatory structure, interest rate fluctuations, ratings agencies actions, and the legal, regulatory, accounting and tax environments governing our funding transactions.
23 Table of Contents In addition, our ability to raise funds is strongly affected by the general state of the U.S. and world economies, and may become increasingly difficult due to economic and other factors. Also, we compete for funding with other banks, savings banks and similar companies, some of which are publicly traded. Many of these institutions are substantially larger, may have more capital and other resources and may have better debt ratings than we do. In addition, as some of these competitors consolidate with other financial institutions, these advantages may increase. Competition from these institutions may increase our cost of funds.
As part of our capital markets financing, we actively securitize our consumer loans. The occurrence of certain events may cause the securitization transactions to amortize earlier than scheduled, which would accelerate the need for additional funding. This early amortization could, among other things, have a significant effect on the ability of the Bank and the Savings Bank to meet the capital adequacy requirements as all off-balance sheet loans experiencing such early amortization would have to be recorded on the balance sheet. See pages 54-56 in Item7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity Risk Management contained in the Corporations Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2005.
Finally, Hibernia has experienced a significant increase in deposits since the Gulf Coast hurricanes, most likely as a result of customers receiving federal funds and insurance payments relating to the hurricanes. Currently, it is unclear what customers will do with these deposits on a long-term scale. It is possible that as rebuilding and reinvesting in the Gulf Coast area begins, the amount of these incremental deposits with Hibernia could decrease significantly.
We May Experience Changes in Our Debt Ratings In general, ratings agencies play an important role in determining, by means of the ratings they assign to issuers and their debt, the availability and cost of wholesale funding. We currently receive ratings from several ratings entities for our secured and unsecured borrowings. As private entities, ratings agencies have broad discretion in the assignment of ratings. A rating below investment grade typically reduces availability and increases the cost of market-based funding, both secured and unsecured. A debt rating of Baa3 or higher by Moodys Investors Service, or BBB- or higher by Standard& Poors and Fitch Ratings, is considered investment grade. Currently, all three ratings agencies rate the unsecured senior debt of the Bank, Hibernia and the Corporation as investment grade. The following chart shows ratings for Capital One Financial Corporation, Capital One Bank and Hibernia National Bank as of December31, 2005. As of that date, the ratings outlooks were as follows: Standard &Poors Moodys Fitch Capital One Financial Corporation BBB- Baa1 BBB Capital One Financial CorporationOutlook Positive Stable Positive Capital One Bank BBB A3 BBB Capital One BankOutlook Positive Stable Positive Hibernia National Bank BBB A3 BBB Hibernia National BankOutlook Positive Stable Positive Because we depend on the capital markets for funding and capital, we could experience reduced availability and increased cost of funding if our debt ratings were lowered. This result could make it difficult for us to grow at or to a level we currently anticipate. The immediate impact of a ratings downgrade on other sources of funding, however, would be limited, as our deposit funding and pricing, as well as some of our unsecured corporate borrowing, is not generally determined by corporate debt ratings.
We Face Market Risk of Interest Rate and Exchange Rate Fluctuations Like other financial institutions, we borrow money from institutions and depositors, which we then lend to customers. We earn interest on the consumer loans we make, and pay interest on the deposits and borrowings we 24 Table of Contents use to fund those loans. Changes in these two interest rates affect the value of our assets and liabilities. If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest income, and therefore our earnings, would fall. Our earnings could also be hurt if the rates on our consumer loans fall more quickly than those on our borrowings. We also seek to minimize market risk to a level that is immaterial to our net income. The financial instruments and techniques we use to manage the risk of interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations, such as asset/liability matching and interest rate and exchange rate swaps and hedges and some forward exchange contracts, may not always work successfully or may not be available at a reasonable cost. Furthermore, if these techniques become unavailable or impractical, our earnings could be subject to volatility and decreases as interest rates and exchange rates change.
Changes in interest rates also affect the balances our customers carry on their credit cards and affect the rate of pre-payment for installment loan products. When interest rates fall, there may be more low-rate product alternatives available to our customers. Consequently, their credit card balances may fall and pre-payment rates for installment loan products may rise. We can mitigate this risk by reducing the interest rates we charge or by refinancing installment loan products. However, these changes can reduce the overall yield on our portfolio if we do not adequately provide for them in our interest rate hedging strategies. When interest rates rise, there are fewer low-rate alternatives available to customers. Consequently, credit card balances may rise (or fall more slowly) and pre-payment rates on installment lending products may fall. In this circumstance, we may have to raise additional funds at higher interest rates. In our credit card business, we could, subject to legal and competitive constraints, mitigate this risk by increasing the interest rates we charge, although such changes may increase opportunities for our competitors to offer attractive products to our customers and consequently increase customer attrition from our portfolio. We could also mitigate this risk through hedging strategies, if available, if we are unable to do so, we could suffer adverse impacts on overall portfolio yield. Rising interest rates across the industry may also lead to higher delinquencies as customers face increasing interest payments both on our products and on other loans they may hold. See pages 56-57 in Item7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsInterest Rate Risk Management contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2005.
We Face the Risk of a Complex and Changing Regulatory and Legal Environment We operate in a heavily regulated industry and are therefore subject to a wide array of banking, consumer lending and deposit laws and regulations that apply to almost every element of our business. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in financial, structural and operational penalties, including receivership. In addition, efforts to comply with these laws and regulations may increase our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. See Supervision and Regulation above. Federal and state laws and regulations, as well as laws and regulations to which we are subject in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business, significantly limit the types of activities in which we may engage. For example, federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, and laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business, limit the manner in which we may offer and extend credit. From time to time, the U.S. Congress, the states and foreign governments consider changing these laws and may enact new laws or amend existing laws and regulatory authorities may issue new regulations. Such new laws or regulations could limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge, restrict our ability to collect on account balances, or materially affect us or the banking or credit card industries in some other manner. Additional federal, state and foreign consumer protection legislation also could seek to expand the privacy protections afforded to customers of financial institutions and restrict our ability to share or receive customer information.
In addition, banking regulators possess broad discretion to issue or revise regulations, or to issue guidance, which may significantly impact us. For example, the Federal Trade Commission has issued, and will continue to issue, a variety of regulations under the FACT Act of 2003, the Federal Reserve has announced proposed rule-making, and has issued some final rules, and in the UK the Office of Fair Trading is conducting an industry investigation on the calculation of default charges, all of which may impact us. Additionally, the new bankruptcy reform legislation will put additional requirements on the Company regarding disclosures on the effects on consumers of making only minimum payments on their accounts. We cannot, however, predict whether and how any new 25 Table of Contents guidelines issued or other regulatory actions taken by the banking or other regulators will be applied to the Bank, the National Bank or the Savings Bank, in what manner such regulations might be applied, or the resulting effect on us, the Bank, the National Bank or the Savings Bank. There can be no assurance that this kind of regulatory action will not have a negative impact on us and/or our financial results.
The Credit Card Industry Faces Increased Litigation Risks Relating to Industry Structure We face possible risks from the outcomes of certain credit card industry litigation. In 1998, the United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against the MasterCard and Visa membership associations composed of financial institutions that issue MasterCard or Visa credit or debit cards (associations), alleging, among other things, that the associations had violated antitrust law and engaged in unfair practices by not allowing member banks to issue cards from competing brands, such as American Express and Discover Financial Services. In 2001, a New York district court entered judgment in favor of the Department of Justice and ordered the associations to repeal these policies. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the district court and, on October4, 2004, the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari in the case. In November 2004, American Express filed an antitrust lawsuit (the Amex lawsuit) against the associations and several member banks alleging that the associations and member banks jointly and severally implemented and enforced illegal exclusionary agreements that prevented member banks from issuing American Express and Discover cards. The complaint requests civil monetary damages, which could be trebled. The Corporation, the Bank, and the Savings Bank are named defendants in this lawsuit.
Separately, a number of entities, each purporting to represent a class of retail merchants, have also filed antitrust lawsuits (the Interchange lawsuits) against the associations and several member banks, including the Corporation and its subsidiaries, alleging among other things, that the associations and member banks conspired to fix the level of interchange fees. The complaints request civil monetary damages, which could be trebled. In October 2005, the Interchange lawsuits were consolidated before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.
We believe that we have meritorious defenses with respect to these cases and intend to defend these cases vigorously. At the present time, management is not in a position to determine whether the resolution of these cases will have a material adverse effect on either the consolidated financial position of the Corporation or the Corporations results of operations in any future reporting period.
In addition, several merchants filed class action antitrust lawsuits, which were subsequently consolidated, against the associations relating to certain debit card products. In April 2003, the associations agreed to settle the lawsuit in exchange for payments to plaintiffs and for changes in policies and interchange rates for debit cards. Certain merchant plaintiffs have opted out of the settlements and have commenced separate lawsuits. Additionally, consumer class action lawsuits with claims mirroring the merchants allegations have been filed in several courts. Finally, the associations, as well as certain member banks, continue to face additional lawsuits regarding policies, practices, products and fees.
With the exception of the Interchange lawsuits and the Amex lawsuit, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are not parties to the lawsuits against the associations described above and therefore will not be directly liable for any amount related to any possible or known settlements of such lawsuits. However, the Corporations subsidiary banks are member banks of MasterCard and Visa and thus may be affected by settlements or lawsuits relating to these issues, including changes in interchange payments. In addition, it is possible that the scope of these lawsuits may expand and that other member banks, including the Corporations subsidiary banks, may be brought into the lawsuits or future lawsuits. The associations are also subject to additional litigation, including suits regarding foreign exchange fees. As a result of such litigation, the associations are expected to continue to evolve as corporate entities, including by changing their governance structures, as previously announced by the associations.
Given the complexity of the issues raised by these lawsuits and the uncertainty regarding: (i)the outcome of these suits, (ii)the likelihood and amount of any possible judgments, (iii)the likelihood, amount and validity of 26 Table of Contents any claim against the associations member banks, including the banks and the Corporation, and (iv)changes in industry structure that may result from the suits and (v)the effects of these suits, in turn, on competition in the industry, member banks, and interchange and association fees, we cannot determine at this time the long-term effects of these suits on us.
We Face the Risk of Fluctuations in Our Expenses and Other Costs that May Hurt Our Financial Results Our expenses and other costs, such as operating and marketing expenses, directly affect our earnings results. In light of the extremely competitive environment in which we operate, and because the size and scale of many of our competitors provides them with increased operational efficiencies, it is important that we are able to successfully manage such expenses. Many factors can influence the amount of our expenses, as well as how quickly they may increase. For example, further increases in postal rates or termination of our negotiated service arrangement with the United States Postal Service could raise our costs for postal service. As our business develops, changes or expands, additional expenses can arise from management of outsourced services, asset purchases, structural reorganization, a reevaluation of business strategies and/or expenses to comply with new or changing laws or regulations. Other factors that can affect the amount of our expenses include legal and administrative cases and proceedings, which can be expensive to pursue or defend.
We Face Risks Related to the Impact of the Gulf Coast Hurricanes That May Be Substantial and Cannot Be Predicted Hibernia is headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana, and maintains branches in the areas of Louisiana and Texas that sustained significant damage from the Gulf Coast hurricanes. Hibernias operations in other parts of Louisiana and Texas have not been impacted, either significantly or at all, by the hurricanes.
As a result of the hurricanes, Hibernia is experiencing increased costs, including the costs of rebuilding or repairing branches and other properties as well as repairing or replacing equipment, some of which are not covered by insurance. Hibernia has also announced substantial employee and recovery related costs.
The Gulf Coast hurricanes have also affected Hibernias consumer, mortgage, auto, commercial and small business loan portfolios by damaging properties pledged as collateral and by impairing certain borrowers ability to repay their loans. In addition, Hibernia may experience losses from certain customer assistance policies, such as fee waivers, adopted in the wake of the hurricanes. The hurricanes may continue to affect Hibernias loan originations and loan portfolio quality into the future and could also adversely impact Hibernias deposit base. More generally, the combined companys ability to compete effectively in the branch banking business in the future, especially with financial institutions whose operations were not concentrated in the affected area or which may have greater resources than the combined company, will depend primarily on Hibernias ability to continue normal business operations and experience growth despite the impact of the hurricanes. The severity and duration of these effects will depend on a variety of factors that are beyond Hibernias control, including the amount and timing of government, private and philanthropic investment (including deposits) in the region, the pace of rebuilding and economic recovery in the region generally, the extent to which the hurricanes property damage is covered by insurance, and the pace at which Hibernia restores its business operations in the various markets in which it operates.
None of the effects described above can be accurately predicted or quantified. As a result, significant uncertainty remains regarding the impact the hurricanes will have on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company and the ability of the combined company to realize the anticipated benefits from the merger. Further, the area in which Hibernia operates may experience hurricanes and other storms in the future, and some of those hurricanes and storms may have effects similar to those caused by the Gulf Coast hurricanes.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations I. Introduction Capital One Financial Corporation (the Corporation) is a diversified financial services company whose banking and non-banking subsidiaries market a variety of financial products and services. The Corporations principal subsidiaries are Capital One Bank (the Bank) which currently offers credit card products and takes retail deposits, Capital One, F.S.B. (the Savings Bank), which offers consumer and commercial lending and consumer deposit products, Hibernia National Bank (the National Bank) which offers a broad spectrum of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients, and Capital One Auto Finance, Inc. (COAF) which offers automobile and other motor vehicle financing products. The Corporation and its subsidiaries are hereafter collectively referred to as the Company. As of December31, 2005, the Company had $47.9 billion in deposits and $105.5 billion in managed loans outstanding and was one of the largest providers of MasterCard and Visa credit cards in the world.
The Companys profitability is affected by the net interest income and non-interest income generated on earning assets, consumer usage and payment patterns, credit quality, levels of marketing expense and operating efficiency. The Companys revenues consist primarily of interest income on consumer loans (including past-due fees) and securities and non-interest income consisting of servicing income on securitized loans, fees (such as annual membership, cash advance, overlimit and other fee income, collectively fees), cross-sell, interchange and gains on the securitizations of loans. Loan securitization transactions qualifying as sales under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) remove the loan receivables from the consolidated balance sheet; however, the Company continues to both own and service the related accounts. The Company generates earnings from its managed loan portfolio that includes both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet loans. Interest income, fees, and recoveries in excess of the interest paid to investors and charge-offs generated from off-balance sheet loans are recognized as servicing and securitizations income.
The Companys primary expenses are the costs of funding assets, provision for loan losses, operating expenses (including associate salaries and benefits), marketing expenses and income taxes. Marketing expenses (e.g., advertising, printing, credit bureau costs and postage) to implement the Companys product strategies are expensed as incurred while the revenues resulting from acquired accounts are recognized over their life.
II. Significant Accounting Policies The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contain a summary of the Companys significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. Several of these policies are considered to be important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. These policies include determination of the level of allowance for loan losses, accounting for securitization transactions, recognition of customer reward costs and finance charge and fee revenue recognition.
Additional information about accounting policies can be found in Item8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1 on page 76.
Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses is maintained at the amount estimated to be sufficient to absorb probable principal losses, net of principal recoveries (including recovery of collateral), inherent in the existing reported loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses is the periodic cost of maintaining an adequate allowance. The amount of allowance necessary is determined primarily based on a migration analysis of delinquent and current accounts and forward loss curves and historical loss trends. The entire balance of an account is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the payment due date. In evaluating the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses, management takes into consideration the following factors: recent trends in delinquencies and 31 Table of Contents charge-offs including bankrupt, deceased and recovered amounts; forecasting uncertainties and size of credit risks; the degree of risk inherent in the composition of the loan portfolio; economic conditions; legal and regulatory guidance; credit evaluations and underwriting policies; seasonality; and the value of collateral supporting the loans. To the extent credit experience is not indicative of future performance or other assumptions used by management do not prevail, loss experience could differ significantly, resulting in either higher or lower future provision for loan losses, as applicable.
Accounting for Securitization Transactions Loan securitization involves the transfer of a pool of loan receivables to a trust or other special purpose entity. The trust sells an undivided interest in the pool of loan receivables to third-party investors through the issuance of asset backed securities and distributes the proceeds to the Company as consideration for the loans transferred. The Company removes loan receivables from the Consolidated Balance Sheets for securitizations that qualify as sales in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilitiesa Replacement of FASB Statement No.125 (SFAS 140). The trusts are qualified special purpose entities as defined by SFAS 140 and are not subsidiaries of the Company and are not included in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The gain on sale recorded from off-balance sheet securitizations is based on the estimated fair value of the assets sold and retained and liabilities incurred, and is recorded at the time of sale, net of transaction costs. The related receivable is the interest-only strip, which is based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows from excess finance charges and past-due fees over the sum of the return paid to security holders, estimated contractual servicing fees and credit losses. Gains on securitization transactions, fair value adjustments related to residual interests and earnings on the Companys securitizations are included in servicing and securitizations income in the Consolidated Statements of Income and amounts due from the trusts are included in accounts receivable from securitizations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Certain estimates inherent in the determination of the fair value of the retained interests are influenced by factors outside the Companys control, and as a result, such estimates could materially change and actual results could be materially different from such estimates. Any future gains that will be recognized in accordance with SFAS 140 will be dependent on the timing and amount of future securitizations. The Company intends to continuously assess the performance of new and existing securitization transactions, and therefore the valuation of retained interests, as estimates of future cash flows change.
Rewards The Company offers credit cards that provide reward program members with various rewards such as airline tickets, free or deeply discounted products or cash rebates, based on purchase volume. The Company establishes a rewards liability based on points earned which are ultimately expected to be redeemed and the average cost per point redemption. As points are redeemed, the rewards liability is relieved. The cost of reward programs is reflected as a reduction to interchange income. The rewards liability will be affected over time as a result of changes in the number of account holders in the reward programs, the actual amount of points earned and redeemed, general economic conditions, the actual costs of the rewards, changes made by reward partners and changes that the Company may make to the reward programs in the future. To the extent assumptions used by management do not prevail, rewards costs could differ significantly, resulting in either a higher or lower future rewards liability, as applicable.
Finance Charge and Fee Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes earned finance charges and fee income on loans according to the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements. When the Company does not expect full payment of finance charges and fees, it does not accrue the estimated uncollectible portion as income (hereafter the suppression amount). To calculate the suppression amount, the Company first estimates the uncollectible portion of finance charge and fee receivables 32 Table of Contents using a formula based on historical account migration patterns and current delinquency status. This formula is consistent with that used to estimate the allowance related to expected principal losses on reported loans. The suppression amount is calculated by adding any current period change in the estimate of the uncollectible portion of finance charge and fee receivables to the amount of finance charges and fees charged-off (net of recoveries) during the period. The Company subtracts the suppression amount from the total finance charges and fees billed during the period to arrive at total reported revenue.
The amount of finance charges and fees suppressed were $1.0 billion, $1.1 billion and $2.0 billion for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The reduction in the suppression amount was driven by the Companys continued asset diversification beyond U.S. consumer credit cards, a continued bias toward originating higher credit quality, lower yielding loans, improved collections experience, ongoing product modifications and an overall improvement in general economic conditions. These factors drove a reduction in total finance charges and fees billed during the period and increased the likelihood of collectibility. Both the lower volume of finance charges and fees billed and the higher expectations of collectibility drove the reduction in the amount of finance charges and fees suppressed. Actual payment experience could differ significantly from managements assumption, resulting in higher or lower future finance charge and fee income.
III. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Off-Balance Sheet Securitizations As discussed in Significant Accounting PoliciesAccounting for Securitization Transactions, the Company actively engages in off-balance sheet securitization transactions of loans for funding purposes. The Company receives the proceeds from third party investors for securities issued from the Companys securitization vehicles which are collateralized by transferred receivables from the Companys portfolio. Securities outstanding totaling $45.3 billion as of December31, 2005, represent undivided interests in the pools of consumer loan receivables that are sold in underwritten offerings or in private placement transactions.
The securitization of consumer loans has been a significant source of liquidity for the Company. Maturity terms of the existing securitizations vary from 2006 to 2025 and, for revolving securitizations, have accumulation periods during which principal payments are aggregated to make payments to investors. As payments on the loans are accumulated and are no longer reinvested in new loans, the Companys funding requirements for such new loans increase accordingly. The Company believes that it has the ability to continue to utilize off-balance sheet securitization arrangements as a source of liquidity; however, a significant reduction or termination of the Companys off-balance sheet securitizations could require the Company to draw down existing liquidity and/or to obtain additional funding through the issuance of secured borrowings or unsecured debt, the raising of additional deposits or the slowing of asset growth to offset or to satisfy liquidity needs.
Recourse Exposure The credit quality of the receivables transferred is supported by credit enhancements, which may be in various forms including interest-only strips, subordinated interests in the pool of receivables, cash collateral accounts, cash reserve accounts and accrued interest and fees on the investors share of the pool of receivables. Some of these credit enhancements are retained by the seller and are referred to as retained residual interests. The Companys retained residual interests are generally restricted or subordinated to investors interests and their value is subject to substantial credit, repayment and interest rate risks on transferred assets if the off-balance sheet loans are not paid when due. Securitization investors and the trusts only have recourse to the retained residual interests, not the Companys assets. See pages 109-112 in Item8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 21 for quantitative information regarding retained interests.
33 Table of Contents Collections and Amortization Collections of interest and fees received on securitized receivables are used to pay interest to investors, servicing and other fees, and are available to absorb the investors share of credit losses. For revolving securitizations, amounts collected in excess of that needed to pay the above amounts are remitted, in general, to the Company. Under certain conditions, some of the cash collected may be retained to ensure future payments to investors. For amortizing securitizations, amounts collected in excess of the amount that is used to pay the above amounts are generally remitted to the Company, but may be paid to investors in further reduction of their outstanding principal. See page 109-112 in Item8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 21 for quantitative information regarding revenues, expenses and cash flows that arise from securitization transactions.
Securitization transactions may amortize earlier than scheduled due to certain early amortization triggers, which would accelerate the need for funding. Additionally, early amortization would have a significant impact on the ability of the Bank and Savings Bank to meet regulatory capital adequacy requirements as all off-balance sheet loans experiencing such early amortization would be recorded on the balance sheet and accordingly would require incremental regulatory capital. As of December31, 2005, no early amortization events related to the Companys off-balance sheet securitizations have occurred.
The amounts of investor principal from off-balance sheet consumer loans as of December31, 2005 that are expected to amortize into the Companys consumer loans, or be otherwise paid over the periods indicated, are summarized in Table 9. Of the Companys total managed loans, 43% and 52% were included in off-balance sheet securitizations for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Letters of Credit and Financial Guarantees As a result of the acquisition of Hibernia, the Company issues letters of credit and financial guarantees (standby letters of credit) whereby it agrees to honor certain financial commitments in the event its customers are unable to perform. The majority of the standby letters of credit consist of financial guarantees. Collateral requirements are similar to those for funded transactions and are established based on managements credit assessment of the customer. Management conducts regular reviews of all outstanding standby letters of credit and customer acceptances, and the results of these reviews are considered in assessing the adequacy of the Companys allowance for loan losses.
The Company had contractual amounts of standby letters of credit of $569.2 million at December31, 2005. As of December31, 2005, standby letters of credit had expiration dates ranging from 2006 to 2010. The fair value of the guarantees outstanding at December31, 2005 that have been issued since January1, 2003, was $4.7 million and was included in other liabilities.
Loan and Line of Credit Commitments As a result of the acquisition of Hibernia, the Company enters into commitments to extend credit are legally binding conditional agreements having fixed expirations or termination dates and specified interest rates and purposes. These commitments generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards. Collateral requirements and loan-to-value ratios are the same as those for funded transactions and are established based on managements credit assessment of the customer. Commitments may expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future requirements. The outstanding unfunded commitments to extend credit other than credit card lines were approximately $4.7 billion as of December31, 2005.
Funding Commitments Related to Synthetic Fuel Tax Credit Transactions In June of 2004 and July of 2005, the Company, through two separate transactions and two consolidated special purpose entities (SPVs), purchased minority ownership interests in two entities established to operate facilities 34 Table of Contents which produce a coal-based synthetic fuel that qualifies for tax credits pursuant to Section29 of the Internal Revenue Code. The SPVs purchased their minority interests from third parties paying $2.6 million in cash and agreeing to pay an estimated $159.1 million comprised of fixed note payments, variable payments and the funding of their share of operating losses sufficient to maintain their minority ownership percentages. Actual total payments will be based on the amount of tax credits generated through the end of 2007. In exchange, the SPVs will receive an estimated $192.0 million in tax benefits resulting from a combination of deductions, allocated operating losses, and tax credits. The Corporation has guaranteed the SPVs commitments under the purchase agreements. As of December31, 2005, the Company has recorded $66.2 million in tax benefits and had an estimated remaining commitment for fixed note payments, variable payments and the funding of their proportionate share of the operating losses totaling $104.6 million.
Guarantees Residual Value Guarantees In December 2000, the Company entered into a 10-year agreement for the lease of the headquarters building being constructed in McLean, Virginia. The agreement called for monthly rent to commence upon completion, which occurred in the first quarter of 2003, and is based on LIBOR rates applied to the cost of the building funded. If, at the end of the lease term, the Company does not purchase the property, the Company guarantees a maximum residual value of up to $114.8 million representing approximately 72% of the $159.5 million cost of the building. This agreement, made with a multi-purpose entity that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of one of the Companys lenders, provides that in the event of a sale of the property, the Companys obligation would be equal to the sum of all amounts owed by the Company under a note issuance made in connection with the lease inception. As of December31, 2005, the value of the building was estimated to be above the maximum residual value that the Company guarantees; thus, no deficiency existed and no liability was recorded relative to this property. During 2005, the Company notified the lender of its intention to purchase the property in 2006 and as such incurred a $20.6 million prepayment penalty related to the refinancing of the McLean headquarters facility.
Other Guarantees In connection with certain installment loan securitization transactions, the transferee (off-balance sheet special purpose entity receiving the installment loans) entered into interest rate hedge agreements (the swaps) with a counterparty to reduce interest rate risk associated with the transactions. In connection with the swaps, the Corporation entered into letter agreements guaranteeing the performance of the transferee under the swaps. If at anytime the ClassA invested amount equals zero and the notional amount of the swap is greater than zero resulting in an Early Termination Date (as defined in the securitization transactions Master Agreement), then (a)to the extent that, in connection with the occurrence of such Early Termination Date, the transferee is obligated to make any payments to the counterparty pursuant to the Master Agreement, the Corporation shall reimburse the transferee for the full amount of such payment and (b)to the extent that, in connection with the occurrence of an Early Termination Date, the transferee is entitled to receive any payment from the counterparty pursuant to the Master Agreement, the transferee will pay to the Corporation the amount of such payment. At December31, 2005, the maximum exposure to the Corporation under the letter agreements was approximately $18.2 million.
IV. Reconciliation to GAAP Financial Measures The Companys consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP are referred to as its reported financial statements. Loans included in securitization transactions which qualify as sales under GAAP have been removed from the Companys reported balance sheet. However, servicing fees, finance charges, and other fees, net of charge-offs, and interest paid to investors of securitizations are recognized as servicing and securitizations income on the reported income statement.
The Companys managed consolidated financial statements reflect adjustments made related to effects of securitization transactions qualifying as sales under GAAP. The Company generates earnings from its 35 Table of Contents managed loan portfolio which includes both the on-balance sheet loans and off-balance sheet loans. The Companys managed income statement takes the components of the servicing and securitizations income generated from the securitized portfolio and distributes the revenue and expense to appropriate income statement line items from which it originated. For this reason, the Company believes the managed consolidated financial statements and related managed metrics to be useful to stakeholders.

V. Management Summary Summary of the year ended December31, 2005 The following discussion provides a summary of 2005 results compared to 2004 results and 2004 results compared to 2003 results. Each component is discussed in further detail in subsequent sections of this analysis.
Year Ended December31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2004 Net income increased 17% to $1.8 billion for the year ended December31, 2005, while diluted earnings per share increased 8% compared to the prior year. The growth in earnings for 2005 was driven by growth in the managed loan portfolio and contributions from 2005 acquisitions. Earnings per share growth was constrained by the increase in share count as a result of the issuance of shares in connection with the execution of the forward purchase contracts related to the mandatory convertible debt securities and stock option exercise activity.
Revenue growth was driven by growth in the managed loan portfolio and contributions from 2005 acquisitions. Provision for loan losses increased due to growth in the reported loan portfolio, estimated losses from the Gulf Coast Hurricanes, and an increase in net charge-offs resulting from the enactment of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Act of 2005 (new bankruptcy legislation). Non-interest expense increased in 2005 driven by increases in operating expense. The increase in operating expense was driven primarily by the 2005 acquisitions, which contributed 86% of the overall increase, and slightly higher one-time charges in 2005, offset by lower 2005 charges related to the corporate-wide cost initiatives. Although operating expenses increased for the year, operating expense as a percentage of average managed assets continued to decline, reflecting the 36 Table of Contents Companys improved operating efficiency. The Companys return on managed assets of 1.72% is consistent with prior years and reflects the sustainability and diversification of the Companys earnings stream.
The Company continues to achieve strong loan growth in its Auto Finance and Global Financial Services segments, which accounted for 91% of the loan growth in 2005 and represents 45% of managed loans at December31, 2005, excluding $16.3 billion in loans added through the Hibernia acquisition. This growth was achieved through organic originations and the acquisition of Onyx Acceptance Corporation (Onyx), a specialty auto loan originator and the Key Bank portfolio which are included in the Auto Finance segment.
In 2005, the Company expanded its lending and deposit products and its distribution channels while delivering strong results and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Total assets continue to grow and the Company continues to maintain significant levels of liquidity. Capital ratios remain well above the regulatory well capitalized thresholds following the acquisition of Hibernia.
Year Ended December31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2003 Net income increased 36% over the prior year, while diluted earnings per share increased 28% compared to the prior year. The growth in earnings for 2004 was primarily driven by an increase in the managed consumer loan portfolio, a reduction in the provision for loan losses, and an increase in servicing and securitization income and other non-interest income, offset in part by an increase in marketing and operating expenses.
Managed loans consist of the Companys reported loan portfolio combined with the off-balance sheet securitized loan portfolio. The Company has retained servicing rights for its securitized loans and receives servicing fees in addition to the excess spread generated from the off-balance sheet loan portfolio. Average managed loans increased 17% for the year ended December31, 2004.
The managed net interest margin for the year ended December31, 2004, decreased 76 basis points. This decrease was due to a reduction in managed earning asset yields, slightly offset by a reduction in the cost of funds. Managed loan yields decreased by 83 basis points for the year ended December31, 2004. The decrease in managed loan yields resulted from the Companys continued asset diversification beyond U.S. consumer credit cards and a bias toward originating higher credit quality, lower yielding loans. In addition, the Company built the average size of its liquidity portfolio by $3.5 billion, placing additional downward pressure on managed earning asset yields as the yield on the liquidity portfolio is lower than the yield on consumer loans.
For the year ended December31, 2004, the provision for loan losses decreased to $1.2 billion from $1.5 billion for the year ended December31, 2003. The decrease in the provision for loan losses reflects a reduction in net charge-offs, improving delinquency rates and lower forecasted charge-offs for the reported loan portfolio at December31, 2004. The improvements in the Companys credit quality metrics are a result of the continued asset diversification beyond U.S consumer credit cards, continued bias toward originating higher credit quality, lower yielding loans, improved collection experience and an overall improvement in general economic conditions compared with the prior year.
Servicing and securitizations income increased $432.1 million as a result of a 16% increase in the average off-balance sheet loan portfolio for the year ended December31, 2004 when compared with the prior year, partially offset by a reduction in the excess spread generated by the off-balance sheet portfolio due to a higher concentration of higher credit quality, lower yielding loans.
For the year ended December31, 2004, other non-interest income increased 51%, when compared to the prior year. This increase is primarily attributable to $72.6 million in pre-tax gains recognized in 2004 on the sale of the Companys joint venture investment in South Africa and sale of the French loan portfolio. The remaining variance is due to increases in income derived from purchased charged-off loan portfolios, slightly offset by a 37 Table of Contents decrease in auto gains and an increase in losses on sales of securities available for sale and losses on the repurchases of senior notes during 2004.
Marketing expense increased 20% for the year ended December31, 2004, compared to the prior year. The increase in marketing expense resulted from favorable opportunities to originate loans during 2004 combined with continued brand investments. Operating expenses increased 7%, for the year ended December31, 2004. The increases were primarily related to charges associated with corporate-wide cost reduction initiatives, charges related to a change in asset capitalization thresholds and charges related to the impairment of internally developed software. Although operating expenses increased, operating expenses as a percentage of average managed loans for the year ended December31, 2004 fell 53 basis points to 5.41% from 5.94% for the prior year. This reduction reflects the continued improvement in the Companys operating efficiencies.
2005 Significant Events Acquisitions In November 2005, the Company acquired Hibernia Corporation, a financial holding company headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana. As part of the transaction, Hibernia Corporation was merged into the Corporation. Hibernias retail bank subsidiary, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation, Hibernia National Bank, has over 300 branch locations operating in Louisiana and Texas. The $5.0 billion acquisition was settled through the issuance of 32.9million shares of the Companys common stock and $2.2 billion in cash and resulted in $3.2 billion of goodwill.
In the first quarter of 2005, the Company acquired Onyx Acceptance Corporation, a specialty auto loan originator; Hfs Group, a United Kingdom based home equity broker; InsLogic, an insurance brokerage firm, and eSmartloan, a U.S. based online originator of home equity loans and mortgages. All were acquired in all cash transactions and resulted in $391.4 million of goodwill. In addition in the second quarter of 2005, the Company purchased a $635.3 million non-prime auto loan portfolio from Key Bank.
Gulf Coast Hurricanes The 2005 Gulf Coast Hurricanes resulted in an estimated $44.1 million of loan losses expected to be realized in the future, which excludes the impact on Hibernia of $175.0 million that was reflected in Hibernias results prior to the acquisition. Of the total estimated impact, $28.5 million was reflected in the provision for loan losses through an increase in the allowance for loan losses and $15.6 million was reflected as a reduction of servicing and securitizations income through a write-down of retained interests related to the Companys loan securitization programs.
The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (new bankruptcy legislation) became effective in October 2005. As a result, prior to the enactment of the new bankruptcy legislation, the Company experienced a significant increase in bankruptcy related charge-offs during 2005 which is reflected through an increase of provision for loan losses for the reported loan portfolio and through a reduction of servicing and securitizations income for the off-balance sheet loan portfolio. Reported and managed charge-offs for bankruptcies increased $146.8 million and $394.8 million, respectively, in 2005 when compared to the prior year.
Cost Reduction Initiatives and Other One-Time Items During 2005, the Company incurred $76.3 million in employee termination and facility consolidation charges related to continued corporate-wide cost reduction initiatives. The Company also incurred a $20.6 million pre-payment penalty related to the refinancing of the McLean headquarters facility and a $28.2 million 38 Table of Contents impairment charge related to its Global Financial Services segment insurance brokerage business. All these charges were recorded in non interest expense. As an offset, the Company recognized in non-interest income a $34.0 million gain on the sale of previously purchased charged-off loan portfolios.
Mandatory Convertible Securities Pursuant to the original terms of the mandatory convertible securities (Upper DECs) issued in April of 2002, the Company completed a remarketing of $704.5 million principal amount of senior notes in February 2005. Following the remarketing, the Company extinguished $585.0 million principal amount of the remarketed senior notes using the proceeds from the issuance of $300.0 million of seven year 4.80% fixed rate senior notes and $300.0 million of twelve year 5.25% fixed rate senior notes. The Company recognized a $12.4 million loss on the extinguishment of the remarketed notes. In May 2005, the Company issued 10.4million shares of common stock in accordance with the settlement provisions of the forward purchase contracts related to the Upper DECs. The issuance provided $747.5 million in cash proceeds.
VI. Financial Summary Adoption of Accounting Pronouncements and Accounting Changes In December 2003, the Company adopted the expense recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123), prospectively to all awards granted, modified or settled after January1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 123 resulted in the recognition of compensation expense of $5.0 million for the year ended December31, 2003. Compensation expense resulted from the discounts provided under the Associate Stock Purchase Plan and the amortization of the estimated fair value of stock options granted during 2003.
In July 2003, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB interpretation No.46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No.51, Revised (FIN 46(R)). The Company has consolidated all material variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary, as defined by FIN 46(R). The consolidation of the VIEs resulted in a $15.0 million ($23.9 pre-tax) charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended December31, 2003.
Additional information about the adoption of accounting pronouncements and accounting changes can be found in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsNote1 on page 76.

40 Table of Contents Summary of the Reported Income Statement The following is a detailed description of the financial results reflected in Table 1  Financial Summary. Additional information is provided in section XII, Tabular Summary as detailed in sections below.
All 2005 comparisons are made between the year ended December31, 2005 and the year ended December31, 2004. All 2004 comparisons are made between the year ended December31, 2004 and the year ended December31, 2003.
Net interest income Net interest income is comprised of interest income and past-due fees earned and deemed collectible from the Companys loans and income earned on securities, less interest expense on interest-bearing deposits, senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings.
For the year ended December31, 2005, reported net interest income increased 23%. The increase was primarily due to significant growth in reported average earning assets. The yield on earning assets and cost of funds remained relatively stable year over year.
Reported net interest income for the year ended December31, 2004 increased 8% compared to the prior year. The increase in net interest income is primarily a result of a 25% increase in the Companys reported average earning assets for the year ended December31, 2004, offset by a decrease in earning asset yields. The reported net interest margin decreased 101 basis points compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the reported loan yield, slightly offset by a decrease in the cost of funds. The reported loan yield decreased 135 basis points. The yield on reported loans decreased due to the Companys continued asset diversification beyond U.S. consumer credit cards and continued bias toward originating higher credit quality, lower yielding loans when compared with the prior year. In addition, the Company increased the average size of its liquidity portfolio by $3.5 billion during 2004. The yield on liquidity portfolio assets is typically lower than those on consumer loans and served to reduce the overall earning assets yields.
For additional information, see section XII, Tabular Summary, Table A (Statements of Average Balances, Income and Expense, Yields and Rates) and Table B (Interest Variance Analysis).
Non-interest income Non-interest income is comprised of servicing and securitizations income, service charges and other customer-related fees, interchange income and other non-interest income.
For the year ended December31, 2005 and 2004, reported non-interest income increased 8% and 9%, respectively. The 2005 and 2004 increases were both due to year over year increases in servicing and securitizations income, service charges and other customer-related fees, interchange income and other non-interest income. See detailed discussion of the components of non-interest income below.
Servicing and Securitizations Income Servicing and securitizations income represents servicing fees, excess spread and other fees derived from the off-balance sheet loan portfolio, adjustments to the fair value of retained interests derived through securitization transactions, as well as gains and losses resulting securitization and other sales transactions.
Servicing and securitizations income increased 9% for the year ended December31, 2005. This increase was primarily the result of a 13% increase in the average off-balance sheet loan portfolio offset by losses from the Gulf Coast hurricanes and bankruptcy charge-offs resulting from the new bankruptcy legislation.
Servicing and securitizations income increased 13% for the year ended December31, 2004. This increase was primarily the result of a 16% increase in the average off-balance sheet loan portfolio for the year ended 41 Table of Contents December31, 2004, compared to the prior year, partially offset by a reduction in the excess spread generated by the off-balance sheet portfolio due to a higher concentration of higher credit quality, lower yielding loans.
Service Charges and Other Customer-Related Fees Excluding $44.7 million contributed by businesses acquired in 2005, service charges and other customer-related fees decreased 2% for the year ended December31, 2005, while the average reported loan portfolio, exclusive of the 2005 acquisitions, grew 7%. The lower growth in service charges and other customer-related fee income when compared to average reported loan growth is reflective of the reported loan growth being concentrated in the Auto Finance and Global Financial Services segments that generate lower fee income.
Service charges and other customer-related fees decreased 9% for the year ended December31, 2004. The decrease was the result of lower overlimit and annual membership fees generated on the reported loan portfolio resulting from the Companys continued asset diversification beyond U.S. consumer credit cards, a continued bias toward originating higher credit quality, lower yielding loans and ongoing product modifications.
Interchange Interchange income, net of rewards expense, increased 8% for the year ended December31, 2005. This increase is primarily related to a 15% increase in purchase volumes. Costs associated with the Companys rewards programs was $176.9 million and $128.2 million for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 38% increase in the rewards expense is due to an increase in purchase volumes and the continued expansion of the rewards program during 2005.
Interchange income increased 26% for the year ended December31, 2004. This increase is primarily attributable to growth in the reported loan portfolio, increased purchase volumes and increased rates paid to the Company by MasterCard and Visa. Total interchange income is net of $128.2 million and $115.4 million of costs related to the Companys rewards programs for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 11% increase in the rewards expense is due to an increase in purchase volumes and an expansion of reward programs during 2004.
Other Non-Interest Income Other non-interest income includes, among other items, commission and fees earned by the Companys mortgage businesses, gains and losses on sales of securities, gains and losses associated with hedging transactions, service provider revenue generated by the Companys healthcare finance business, gains on the sale of auto loans and income earned related to purchased charged-off loan portfolios.
Other non-interest income for the year ended December31, 2005, included $160.0 million of income related to businesses acquired during 2005. Exclusive of the income generated from businesses acquired, other non-interest income decreased 20% from the prior year. This decrease is primarily the result of gains recognized in 2004, including a $31.5 million gain from the sale of the Companys joint venture investment in South Africa and a $41.1 million gain from the sale of the French loan portfolio, as well as, a $26.3 million reduction in gains recognized from the sale of auto loans in 2005 due to lower volume of whole loan sales. These reductions in 2005 in other non-interest income were partially offset by a $34.0 million gain from the sale of previously purchased charged-off loan portfolios during 2005.
Other non-interest income increased 51% for the year ended December31, 2004. The increase in other non-interest income was primarily due to $72.6 million in pre-tax gains recognized in 2004 related to the sale of the Companys joint venture investment in South Africa ($31.5 million pre-tax) and sale of the French loan portfolio ($41.1 million pre-tax) and an increase in income earned from purchased charged-off loan portfolios of $43.7 million for the year ended December31, 2004. These increases were partially offset by decreases in auto 42 Table of Contents gains of $26.1 million and an $18.0 million increase in losses realized on the sale of securities and the repurchase of senior notes for the year ended December31, 2004.
Provision for loan losses The provision for loan losses increased 22% for the year ended December31, 2005 compared to the prior year. This increase was driven by 14% growth in the reported loan portfolio, exclusive of Hibernia loans acquired, estimated losses resulting from the Gulf Coast hurricanes, and an increase in net charge-offs resulting from the enactment of the new bankruptcy legislation. Exclusive of the estimated losses from the Gulf Coast Hurricanes and the increase in bankruptcy related charge-offs in 2005 compared to 2004, the provision for loan losses would have increased 8% from the prior year. This provision for loan losses increase relative to the 14% growth in the reported loan portfolio reflects a continued increase in the concentration of higher credit quality loans in the reported loan portfolio.
For the year ended December31, 2004, the provision for loan losses decreased 20%. While the Companys reported loan portfolio increased 16% at December31, 2004, the impact of the loan growth to the allowance was more than offset by the loan growth being concentrated in higher credit quality loans, an improvement in collection experience, and improved economic conditions. Evidence of the improvement in these factors can be seen in the 30-plus day reported delinquency rate which was 3.85% at December31, 2004, down 94 basis points from December31, 2003 and the reported charge-off rate which was 3.78% for the year ended December31, 2004, down 196 basis points from the prior year.
Non-interest expense Non-interest expense consists of marketing and operating expenses.
Non-interest expense increased 7% for the year ended December31, 2005, reflecting flat marketing spend and a 9% increase in operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by the 2005 acquisitions and slightly higher 2005 one-time charges, offset by lower 2005 charges related to the companys corporate-wide cost reduction initiatives announced in 2004. Companies acquired in 2005 contributed $303.8 million in operating expenses or 86% of the overall increase. In addition, the company recognized a $20.6 million pre-payment penalty related to the refinancing of the McLean headquarters facility and a $28.2 million impairment charge related to its Global Financial Services segment insurance brokerage business compared to a total of $36.4 million in 2004 one-time charges detailed below. 2005 operating expenses were positively impacted by a $67.3 million reduction in employee termination benefits and facility consolidation costs related to corporate-wide cost reduction initiatives. Excluding the aforementioned items, operating expenses increased 2% for the year ended December31, 2005. This increase was the result of 7% managed loan growth, excluding 2005 acquisitions, and reflects improved operating efficiencies. Operating expenses as a percentage of average managed assets for the year ended December31, 2005 fell 33 basis points to 4.12% from 4.45% for the prior year.
Non-interest expense increased 10% for the year ended December31, 2004. Marketing expense increased 20% for the year ended December31, 2004. The increase in marketing expense is the result of favorable opportunities to originate loans during 2004 combined with continued brand investments. Operating expenses were $4.0 billion for the year ended December31, 2004, compared to $3.7 billion for December31, 2003. The increase in operating expense of $246.1 was primarily due to $161.2 million in pre-tax charges consisting of $124.8 million in employee termination benefits and facility consolidation costs related to corporate-wide cost reduction initiatives, $20.6 million related to a change in asset capitalization thresholds and $15.8 million related to impairment of internally developed software. Additionally, a $41.8 million increase in professional services expense and a $50.5 million increase in expenses related to credit recovery efforts contributed to the increase in operating expense for the year ended December31, 2004 when compared with the prior year. Although operating expenses increased, operating expenses as a percentage of average managed loans for the year ended 43 Table of Contents December31, 2004 fell 53 basis points to 5.41% from 5.94% for the prior year. This reduction reflects the continued improvement in the Companys operating efficiencies.
Income taxes The Companys effective tax rate was 36.1%, 34.6% and 37% for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The effective rate includes state, federal and international income tax components. The increase in the 2005 rate compared to 2004 was primarily driven by changes in the Companys international tax positions. The decrease in the 2004 tax rate compared to 2003 was primarily due to increased profitability in the Companys international businesses which are in lower taxed territories, investment in synthetic fuel credits and ongoing tax planning activities.
Loan Portfolio Summary The Company analyzes its financial performance on a managed loan portfolio basis. The managed loan portfolio is comprised of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet loans. The Company has retained servicing rights for its securitized loans and receives servicing fees in addition to the excess spread generated from the off-balance sheet loan portfolio.
Average managed loans grew 16% and 17% for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 2004 growth was distributed across all segments while average managed loan growth in 2005 was primarily due to growth in Auto Finance and Global Financial Services.
For additional information, see section XII, Tabular Summary, Table C (Managed Consumer Loan Portfolio).
Asset Quality The Companys credit risk profile is managed to maintain strong risk adjusted returns and diversification across the full credit spectrum and in each of its lending products. Certain lending products have, in some cases, higher expected delinquencies and charge-off rates. The costs associated with higher delinquency and charge-off rates are considered in the pricing of individual products.
Delinquencies The Company believes delinquencies to be an indicator of loan portfolio credit quality at a point in time. The entire balance of an account is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the payment due date. Delinquencies not only have the potential to impact earnings if the account charges off, but they also result in additional costs in terms of the personnel and other resources dedicated to resolving the delinquencies.
The 30-plus day delinquency rate for the reported and managed consumer loan portfolio decreased 71 and 58 basis points, respectively, at December31, 2005. The reduction in the reported and managed consumer loan 30-plus day delinquency rates reflect a higher concentration of lower loss assets in the respective loan portfolios (including $16.3 billion loans added through the acquisition of Hibernia), the clearing out of delinquencies related to recent bankruptcy related charge-offs and overall improved collections experience.
The 30-plus day delinquency rate for the reported consumer loan portfolio decreased 94 basis points at December31, 2004 compared to December31, 2003. The 30-plus day delinquency rate for the managed consumer loan portfolio at December31, 2004 was down 64 basis points compared to December31, 2003. Both reported and managed consumer loan delinquency rate decreases principally reflect the Companys continued asset diversification beyond U.S. consumer credit cards, a continued bias toward originating higher credit quality loans, improved collections experience and an overall improvement in general economic conditions.
For additional information, see section XII, Tabular Summary, Table E (Delinquencies).
44 Table of Contents Net Charge-Offs Net charge-offs include the principal amount of losses (excluding accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and fraud losses) less current period principal recoveries. The Company charges off credit card loans at 180 days past the due date and generally charges off other consumer loans at 120 days past the due date or upon repossession of collateral. Costs to recover previously charged-off accounts are recorded as collection expenses in other non-interest expense. Non-collateralized bankruptcies are typically charged-off within 2-7 days upon notification and in any event within 30 days.
The reported and managed net charge-off rates decreased 23 and 16 basis points, respectively, while net charge-off dollars increased 12% and 11% on a reported and managed basis, respectively, for the year ended December31, 2005 compared to the prior year. The decrease in net charge-off rates principally relates to the Companys continued asset diversification within and beyond U.S. consumer credit cards. The increase in the net charge-off dollars was driven by growth in the reported and managed loan portfolios combined with the incremental increase of bankruptcy charge-offs resulting from the enactment of the new bankruptcy legislation as discussed in the 2005 Significant Events section above. Reported and managed bankruptcy charge-offs increased $146.8 million and $394.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December31, 2005 when compared to the prior year.
For the year ended December31, 2004, the reported and managed net charge-off rates decreased 196 and 145 basis points, respectively when compared with the prior year. The decrease in net charge-off rates principally relates to the Companys continued asset diversification beyond U.S. consumer credit cards, a continued bias toward originating higher credit quality loans, improved collections experience and an overall improvement in general economic conditions.
For additional information, see section XII, Tabular Summary, Table F (Net Charge-offs).
Nonperforming Assets The Company assumed nonperforming assets in connection with the acquisition of Hibernia.
Nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans (loans on which interest income is not currently recognized) and restructured loans (loans with below-market interest rates or other concessions due to the deteriorated financial condition of the borrower). Commercial and small business loans are placed in nonaccrual status at 90 days past due or sooner if, in managements opinion, there is doubt concerning the ability to fully collect both principal and interest. Real estate secured consumer loans are placed in nonaccrual status at 180 days past due.
For additional information, see section XII, Tabular Summary, Table G (Nonperforming Assets).
Allowance for loan losses The allowance for loan losses is maintained at an amount estimated to be sufficient to absorb probable losses, net of principal recoveries (including recovery of collateral), inherent in the existing reported loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses is the periodic cost of maintaining an adequate allowance. Management believes that, for all relevant periods, the allowance for loan losses was adequate to cover anticipated losses in the total reported consumer loan portfolio under then current conditions, met applicable legal and regulatory guidance and was consistent with GAAP. There can be no assurance as to future credit losses that may be incurred in connection with the Companys loan portfolio, nor can there be any assurance that the loan loss allowance that has been established by the Company will be sufficient to absorb such future credit losses. The allowance is a general allowance applicable to the reported consumer loan portfolio. The amount of allowance necessary is determined primarily based on a migration analysis of delinquent and current accounts, forward loss curves and historical loss trends. In evaluating the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses, management also takes into consideration the following factors: recent trends in delinquencies and charge-offs including bankrupt, deceased and recovered amounts; forecasting uncertainties and size of credit risks; the degree of risk inherent in the 45 Table of Contents composition of the loan portfolio; economic conditions; legal and regulatory guidance; credit evaluations and underwriting policies; seasonality; and the value of collateral supporting the loans.
The allowance for loan losses increased $285.0 million from December31, 2004 driven primarily by the acquisition of Hibernia which added $214.2 million of allowance for loan losses at December31, 2005. The remaining increase was the result of 14% growth in the reported loan portfolio, exclusive of Hibernia loans acquired, and an additional allowance build of $28.5 million due to the Gulf Coast Hurricanes as discussed in the 2005 Significant Events section above. The 5% growth in the allowance, exclusive of the Hibernia acquisition, relative to the 14% growth in the reported loan portfolio was due to the growth being concentrated in lower loss auto loans.
For additional information, see section XII, Tabular Summary, Table H (Summary of Allowance for Loan Losses).
VII. Reportable Segment Summary The Company manages its business as three distinct operating segments: U.S. Card, Auto Finance and Global Financial Services. The U.S. Card, Auto Finance and Global Financial Services segments are considered reportable segments based on quantitative thresholds applied to the managed loan portfolio for reportable segments provided by SFAS No.131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.
As management makes decisions on a managed portfolio basis within each segment, information about reportable segments is provided on a managed basis.
The Company maintains its books and records on a legal entity basis for the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The following table presents information prepared from the Companys internal management information system, which is maintained on a line of business level through allocations from legal entities.
US Card Segment Table 2: U.S. Card As of and for the Year Ended December 31 (Dollars in thousands) 2005 2004 2003 Earnings (Managed Basis) Net interest income $ 4,793,956 $ 4,655,897 $ 4,287,814 Non-interest income 3,321,457 3,219,567 3,583,357 Total revenue 8,115,413 7,875,464 7,871,171 Provision for loan losses 2,279,109 2,207,888 2,647,406 Non-interest expense 3,356,600 3,499,918 3,348,894 Income before taxes 2,479,704 2,167,658 1,874,871 Income taxes 870,351 780,357 693,702 Net income $ 1,609,353 $ 1,387,301 $ 1,181,169 Selected Metrics (Managed Basis) Period end loans $ 49,463,522 $ 48,609,571 $ 46,278,750 Average loans 46,827,775 45,812,973 41,308,511 Net charge-off rate 5.01 % 5.05 % 6.88 % 30+ day delinquency rate 3.44 3.97 4.60 Purchase volume (1) $ 73,687,136 $ 64,039,668 $ 58,137,538 (1) Includes purchase transactions net of returns and excludes cash advance transactions.
The U.S. Card segment consists of domestic consumer credit card lending activities.
46 Table of Contents Year Ended December31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2004 The U.S. Card segment provided earnings growth primarily as a result of year over year loan growth and improved operating efficiencies. U.S. Card segment net income for 2005 grew as a result of higher revenue and lower non-interest expense, offset by higher provision for loan losses. Total revenues grew 3% for the year, as a result of 2% growth in the average loan portfolio coupled with higher purchase volumes. Current period earnings reflect the Companys choice not to engage in certain repricing practices prevalent in the industry that focus on short-term growth at the expense of customer loyalty and generating long-term profitability.
The provision for loan losses increased 3% for the year ended December31, 2005. The increase is due to an increase in 2005 bankruptcy related charge-offs resulting from the enactment of new bankruptcy legislation, $10.0 million in estimated future losses resulting from the Gulf Coast Hurricanes and growth in the loan portfolio.
Non-interest expense for 2005 included a $16.8 million expense allocation related to the prepayment penalty for the refinancing of the McLean Headquarters facility and an $85.3 million reduction in charges associated with the Companys continued cost reduction initiatives compared to 2004. Exclusive of these charges, non-interest expense decreased 2%, reflecting improved operating efficiencies.
Year Ended December31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2003 Total U.S. Card segment loans increased 5% at December31, 2004 compared to the prior year. The Company achieved loan growth in this highly competitive segment by continuing to develop innovative new products and leveraging its brand. The contribution to net income from the U.S. Card segment increased 17% for the year ended December31, 2004 when compared with the prior year. The increase in net income is attributable to growth in the loan portfolio, improving credit quality and operating efficiencies, partially offset by $62.1 million in after-tax severance and facility consolidation charges related to cost reduction initiatives and $9.6 million in after-tax charges related to a change in asset capitalization thresholds allocated to the U.S. Card segment during 2004.
The U.S. Card segments net charge-off rate decreased 183 basis points for the year ended December31, 2004 when compared with the prior year. The reduction in the net charge-off rate resulted from a decrease in net charge-offs of $527.2 million, or 19%, while average U.S. Card segment loans grew 11% during 2004. The decrease in net charge-offs was driven by the Companys continued bias toward originating higher credit quality loans, improved collections experience and an overall improvement in general economic conditions.
The 30-plus day delinquency rate for the U.S. Card segment was down 63 basis points at December31, 2004. The decrease in delinquencies is due to the Companys continued bias toward originating higher credit quality loans, improved collections experience, and an overall improvement in general economic conditions.
47 Table of Contents Auto Finance Segment Table 3: Auto Finance As of and for the Year Ended December31 (Dollars in thousands) 2005 2004 2003 Earnings (Managed Basis) Net interest income $ 1,149,377 $ 797,936 $ 727,987 Non-interest income 19,951 80,712 101,984 Total revenue 1,169,328 878,648 829,971 Provision for loan losses 459,513 279,981 382,952 Non-interest expense 506,480 342,761 289,414 Income before taxes 203,335 255,906 157,605 Income taxes 71,268 92,126 58,314 Net income $ 132,067 $ 163,780 $ 99,291 Selected Metrics (Managed Basis) Period end loans $ 16,372,019 $ 9,997,497 $ 8,466,873 Average loans 14,177,631 9,305,008 7,799,706 Net charge-off rate 2.70 % 3.28 % 4.62 % 30+ day delinquency rate 5.71 5.50 7.55 Auto loan originations (1) $ 10,447,600 $ 6,677,120 $ 6,552,462 (1) Includes all organic auto loan originations and excludes auto loans added through acquisitions.
The Auto Finance segment consists of automobile and other motor vehicle financing activities.
Year Ended December31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2004 The Auto Finance segments loan portfolio increased 64% year over year as a result of 2005 acquisitions of Onyx Acceptance Corporation and the Key Bank non-prime auto loan portfolio, as well as, strong organic originations growth aided, in part, by auto manufacturers employee-pricing initiatives and other discount programs in 2005.
Auto Finance net income decreased for the year ended December31, 2005, as a result of increases in the provision for loan losses and non-interest expense, as well as lower gains from the sale of auto loans.
Growth in the loan portfolio also resulted in a significant increase in revenue. However, this increase was offset by a decrease in non-interest income primarily related to $24.7 million reduction in gains from the sale of auto loans, inclusive of allocations related to funds transfer pricing, compared to the prior year.
The provision for loan losses increased 64% for the year ended December31, 2005, as a result of significant organic loan growth, $16.0 million of estimated future incremental losses resulting from the Gulf Coast Hurricanes, and losses related to the enactment of the new bankruptcy legislation.
Non-interest expense increased 48% for the year ended December31, 2005, driven by growth in the loan portfolio and incremental operating and integration expenses related to the 2005 acquisitions.
For the year ended, December31, 2005, the Auto Finance segments net charge-off rate was down 58 basis points from the prior year. Net charge-offs of Auto Finance segment loans increased $77.1 million, or 25%, while average Auto Finance loans for the year ended December31, 2005 grew $4.9 billion, or 52%, compared to the prior year. The decrease in the charge-off rate was primarily driven by the acquisition of Onyx Acceptance Corporation, which originates and services a portfolio of mostly prime auto receivables, improved loan quality, collections performance and favorable industry trends, and a $20.4 million one-time acceleration of charge-offs in 2004 related to a change in the charge-off recognition process for auto loans in bankruptcy.
48 Table of Contents The 30-plus day delinquency rate for the Auto Finance segment was up 21 basis points at December31, 2005. The increase in delinquencies was the result of a spike in bankruptcy filings prior to the enactment of the new bankruptcy legislation in October 2005 and the $20.4 million one-time acceleration of charge-offs in December 2004, which moved delinquent accounts to charge-off status in that year.
Year Ended December31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2003 Total Auto Finance segment loans increased 18% at December31, 2004, compared to the prior year. The increase in auto loans was primarily the result of growth in prime loans originated through the internet and growth in loans originated in the dealer segment. For the year ended December31, 2004, the net income contribution from the Auto Finance segment increased 65% compared to 2003, as a result of growth in the loan portfolio and improving credit loss experience.
The Company sold $901.3 million and $1.9 billion of auto loans in 2004 and 2003, respectively. These transactions resulted in pre-tax gains of $40.3 million and $66.4 million for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Pre-tax gains allocated to the Auto Finance segment, inclusive of allocations related to funds transfer pricing, were $41.7 million and $57.3 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2004, the Company terminated its forward flow auto receivables agreement; however, the Company plans to continue to sell auto receivables through other channels.
For the year ended December31, 2004, the Auto Finance segments net charge-off rate was down 134 basis points from the prior year. Net charge-offs of Auto Finance segment loans decreased $54.8 million, or 15%, while average Auto Finance loans for the year ended December31, 2004 grew $1.5 billion, or 19%, compared to the prior year. The decrease in the charge-off rate was primarily driven by improved loan quality, collections performance and favorable industry trends, partially offset by a $20.4million one-time acceleration of charge-offs related to a change in the charge-off recognition process for auto loans in bankruptcy.
The 30-plus day delinquency rate for the Auto Finance segment was down 205 basis points at December31, 2004. The decrease in delinquencies was the result of a higher mix of prime loans and improved delinquency performance of non-prime loans.
Global Financial Services Segment Table 4: Global Financial Services As of and for the Year Ended December31 (Dollars in thousands) 2005 2004 2003 Earnings (Managed Basis) Net interest income $ 1,680,522 $ 1,421,508 $ 1,072,098 Non-interest income 1,022,756 844,192 605,821 Total revenue 2,703,278 2,265,700 1,677,919 Provision for loan losses 925,777 683,612 595,543 Non-interest expense 1,496,678 1,265,549 988,321 Income before taxes 280,823 316,539 94,055 Income taxes 94,796 103,459 29,216 Net income $ 186,027 $ 213,080 $ 64,839 Selected Metrics (Managed Basis) Period end loans $ 23,386,490 $ 21,240,325 $ 16,507,937 Average loans 22,212,680 18,639,180 13,904,693 Net charge-off rate 3.97 % 3.39 % 3.83 % 30+ day delinquency rate 2.83 2.81 2.70 49 Table of Contents The Global Financial Services segment consists of international lending activities, small business lending, installment loans, home loans, healthcare financing and other consumer financial service activities.
Year Ended December31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2004 Global Financial Services segments loan portfolio increased 10% year over year as a result of the underlying performance of our North American businesses.
Global Financial Services net income decreased 13% for the year ended December31, 2005 as a result of increases in provision for loan losses and non-interest expense and one-time gains on the sales of the Companys joint venture investment in South Africa and French loan portfolio that occurred during 2004, offset by increases in revenue. Total revenue increased 19% for the year ended December31, 2005 as a result of a 19% growth in average loans for the same period and contributions from the Global Financial Services businesses acquired in 2005.
The provision for loan losses increased 35% for the year ended December31, 2005, as a result of growth in the loan portfolio combined with deteriorating credit quality metrics in the U.K. during 2005.
Non-interest expense in 2005 included a $28.2 million impairment charge related to the write-off of goodwill and other charges related to the Companys insurance brokerage business. Non-interest expense in 2004 included expense associated with a change in fixed asset capitalization thresholds and impairment of internally developed software. Exclusive of these one time charges and a $20.5 million reduction in employee termination and facility consolidation charges, non-interest expense for the year ended December31, 2005, increased 18% in line with the 19% growth in average managed loans.
Year Ended December31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2003 Total Global Financial Services segment loans increased 29% at December31, 2004, compared to the prior year. The increase in total loans reflects the Companys continued successful efforts to diversify its loan portfolio, an increase in account growth and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Net income contribution from the Global Financial Services segment for the year ended December31, 2004, increased $148.2 million, compared to the prior year. Global Financial Services segment net income includes after-tax charges of $17.0 million related to severance and facility consolidation resulting from cost reduction initiatives, $2.4 million related to changes in asset capitalization thresholds, and $10.3 million from the impairment of internally developed software. The overall improvement in the Global Financial Services segments financial performance was primarily due to the success of many of the Companys larger diversification businesses in the U.S. and U.K.
During 2004, the Company sold its interest in a South African joint venture with a book value of $3.9 million to its joint venture partner. The Company received $26.2 million in cash, was forgiven $9.2 million in liabilities and recognized a pre-tax gain of $31.5 million. Also during 2004, the Company sold its French loan portfolio with a book value of $144.8 million to an external party.

Net charge-offs increased $99.1 million, or 19% during 2004 while average Global Financial Services segment loans grew $4.7 billion, or 34%. The decrease in the net charge-off rate was driven primarily by a bias toward originating higher credit quality loans within the Global Financial Services segment, improved collection experience and an overall improvement in economic conditions.
The 30-plus day delinquency rate for the Global Financial Services segment was, up 11 basis points at December31, 2004. Global Financial Services delinquencies increased primarily as a result of an expansion of the international loan portfolio during 2004.

Prior to the establishment of the Senior and Subordinated Global Bank Note Program, the Bank issued senior unsecured debt through an $8.0 billion Senior Domestic Bank Note Program. The Bank did not renew the Senior Domestic Bank Note Program for future issuances following the establishment of the Senior and Subordinated Global Bank Note Program.
In June 2004, the Company terminated its Domestic Revolving and Multicurrency Credit Facilities and replaced them with a new revolving credit facility (Credit Facility) providing for an aggregate of $750.0 million in unsecured borrowings from various lending institutions to be used for general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility is available to the Corporation, the Bank, the Savings Bank, and Capital One Bank (Europe), plc, subject to covenants and conditions customary in transactions of this type. The Corporations availability has been increased to $500.0 million under the Credit Facility. All borrowings under the Credit Facility are based upon varying terms of London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR).

As of December31, 2005, the Corporation had one effective shelf registration statement under which the Corporation from time to time may offer and sell senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, common equity units and stock purchase contracts. This shelf registration statement was updated in October 2005 to increase capacity to an aggregate amount not to exceed $2.5 billion.
On May17, 2005, the Company issued 10.4million shares of common stock in accordance with the settlement provisions of the forward purchase contracts related to the mandatory convertible debt securities (the Upper DECs) issued in April of 2002. The issuance provided $747.5 million in cash proceeds.
In May 2005, the Company issued $500.0 million of ten year 5.50% fixed rate senior notes through its shelf registration.
In February 2005, the Company completed a remarketing of approximately $704.5 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% senior notes due May17, 2007. As a result of the remarketing, the annual interest rate on the senior notes was reset to 4.738%. The remarketing was conducted pursuant to the original terms of the Uppers Decs mandatory convertible securities issued in April of 2002. Subsequently in February 2005, the Company extinguished $585.0 million principal amount of the remarketed senior notes and issued in its place $300.0 million of seven year 4.80% fixed rate senior notes and $300.0 million of twelve year 5.25% fixed rate senior notes.
In November 2005, in connection with the Hibernia acquisition, the Company assumed $100.0 million of ten year 5.35% fixed rate subordinated notes. The Company also assumed $51.5 million aggregate principal amount of 9.0% junior subordinated debentures due June30, 2032 and $10.3 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate (LIBOR plus 3.05%, reset quarterly) junior subordinated debentures due June30, 2033. The debentures were issued by a subsidiary of Hibernia to Coastal Capital Trust I (CCTI) and Coastal Capital Trust II (CCTII). CCTI and CCTII are considered business trusts. The trust preferred securities represent a beneficial interest in the assets of the business trusts.
In connection with the Hibernia acquisition, the Company also assumed Federal Reserve Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances which are secured by the Companys investment in FHLB stock and by a blanket floating lien on portions of the Companys residential mortgage loan portfolio. FHLB stock totaled $105.2 million at December31, 2005 and is included in securities available for sale.
Deposits The Company continues to expand its retail deposit gathering efforts through its direct marketing channels. With the completion of the Hibernia acquisition, retail deposits will also be originated through the existing Hibernia branch network and through De Novo branch expansion.
Deposits from the direct marketing business continued to grow due to expansion in marketed channels, such as the internet.
With the acquisition of Hibernia, Capital One acquired a new channel for deposit growth. The branch network offers a broader set of deposit products that include demand deposits, money market deposits, NOW accounts, and certificates of deposits (CDs). Hibernia experienced an increase in incremental deposits since the Gulf Coast Hurricanes due in part to customers receiving federal funds and insurance payments.
As of December31, 2005, the Company had $47.9 billion in deposits of which $2.4 billion were held in foreign banking offices and $11.0 billion represented large domestic denomination certificates of $100 thousand or more.

Funding Obligations Table 9 summarizes the amounts and maturities of the contractual funding obligations of the Company, including off-balance sheet funding.
Table 9: Funding Obligations As of December31, 2005 Total Up to 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years After 5 years Interest-bearing deposits $ 43,092,096 $ 22,162,105 $ 9,823,370 $ 9,739,034 $ 1,367,587 Senior and subordinated notes 6,743,979 1,220,438 1,950,491 1,093,316 2,479,734 Other borrowings (1) 15,534,161 6,194,521 6,262,285 3,058,620 18,735 Operating leases 283,920 57,503 98,531 54,410 73,476 Off-balance sheet securitization amortization 45,227,433 9,323,251 19,824,086 8,155,324 7,924,772 Total obligations $ 110,881,589 $ 38,957,818 $ 37,958,763 $ 22,100,704 $ 11,864,304 (1) Other borrowings includes secured borrowings for the Companys on-balance sheet auto loan securitizations, junior subordinated capital income securities and debentures, FHLB advances, federal funds purchased and resale agreements and other short-term borrowings.
The terms of the lease and credit facility agreements related to certain other borrowings and operating leases in Table 9 require several financial covenants (including performance measures and equity ratios) to be met. If these covenants are not met, there may be an acceleration of the payment due dates noted above. As of December31, 2005, the Company was not in default of any such covenants.
Liquidity Risk Management Liquidity risk management refers to the way the Company manages the use and availability of various funding sources to meet its current and future operating needs. These needs change as loans grow, securitizations, debt and other deposits mature, and payments on other obligations are met. Because the characteristics of the Companys assets and liabilities change, liquidity risk management is a dynamic process, affected by the pricing and maturity of investment securities, loans, deposits, securitizations and other assets and liabilities.
To facilitate liquidity risk management, the Company uses a variety of funding sources to establish a maturity pattern that provides a prudent mixture of short-term and long-term funds. The Company obtains funds through the gathering of deposits, issuing debt and equity, and securitizing assets. Further liquidity is provided to the Company through committed facilities. As of December31, 2005, the Corporation, the Bank, the Savings Bank, the National Bank and COAF collectively had over $10.8 billion in unused commitments under various credit facilities (including the Collateralized Revolving Credit Facility) and unused conduit capacity available for liquidity needs.
Additionally, the Company maintains a portfolio of highly rated and highly liquid securities in order to provide adequate liquidity and to meet its ongoing cash needs. As of December31, 2005, the Company had $13.3 billion of such securities, cash and cash equivalents, net of pledged securities of $5.1 billion.
As discussed in Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, a significant source of liquidity for the Company has been the securitization of consumer loans. As of December31, 2005 the Company funded approximately 43% of its managed loans (51% excluding Hibernia loans) through off-balance sheet securitizations. The Company expects to securitize additional loan principal receivables during 2006. The Companys securitization program has maturities in 2006 and through 2025. The revolving securitizations have accumulation periods during which 54 Table of Contents principal payments are aggregated to make payments to investors. As payments on the loans are accumulated and are no longer reinvested in new loans, the Companys funding requirements for such new loans increase accordingly. The occurrence of certain events may cause the securitization transactions to amortize earlier than scheduled, which would accelerate the need for funding. Additionally, this early amortization could have a significant effect on the ability of the Bank, the Savings Bank and the National Bank to meet the capital adequacy requirements as all off-balance sheet loans experiencing such early amortization would have to be recorded on the balance sheet and accordingly would require incremental regulatory capital. As such amounts mature or are otherwise paid, the Company believes it can securitize additional consumer loans, gather deposits, purchase federal funds and establish other funding sources to fund new loan growth, although no assurance can be given to that effect.
The Company is a leading issuer in the securitization markets. Despite the size and relative stability of these markets and the Companys position as a leading issuer, if these markets experience difficulties the Company may be unable to securitize its loan receivables or to do so at favorable pricing levels. Factors affecting the Companys ability to securitize its loan receivables or to do so at favorable pricing levels include the overall credit quality of the Companys securitized loans, the stability of the market for securitization transactions, and the legal, regulatory, accounting and tax environments governing securitization transactions. If the Company was unable to continue to securitize its loan receivables at current levels, the Company would use its investment securities and money market instruments in addition to alternative funding sources to fund increases in loan receivables and meet its other liquidity needs. The resulting change in the Companys current liquidity sources could potentially subject the Company to certain risks. These risks would include an increase in the Companys cost of funds, an increase in the reserve and the provision for possible credit losses as more loans would remain on the Companys consolidated balance sheet, and limited or no loan growth, if the Company were unable to find alternative and cost-effective funding sources. In addition, if the Company could not continue to remove the loan receivables from the balance sheet the Company would possibly need to raise additional capital to support loan and asset growth.
Based on past deposit activity, the Company expects to retain a portion of its deposit balances as they mature. Therefore, the Company anticipates the net cash outflow related to deposits within the next year will be significantly less than reported in Table 13. The Company utilizes deposits to fund loan and other asset growth and to diversify funding sources.
Core deposits are comprised of domestic non-interest bearing deposits, NOW accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit of less than $100,000 and other consumer time deposits. The Company maintains a Grand Cayman branch for issuing Eurodollar time deposits.
The Company has deposits that are obtained through the use of a third-party intermediary. Included in these deposits at December31, 2005, were brokered deposits of $11.4 billion, compared to $9.1 billion at December31, 2004. These deposits represented 24% and 36% of total deposits at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. If these brokered deposits are not renewed at maturity, the Company would use its investment securities and money market instruments in addition to alternative funding sources to fund increases in loan receivables and meet its other liquidity needs. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 limits the use of brokered deposits to well-capitalized insured depository institutions and, with a waiver from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to adequately capitalized institutions. At December31, 2005, the Bank, the Savings Bank, the National Bank and the Company were well-capitalized as defined under the federal bank regulatory guidelines. Based on the Companys historical access to the brokered deposit market, it expects to replace maturing brokered deposits with new brokered deposits or with the Companys direct deposits.
Other funding programs established by the Company include senior and subordinated notes. At December31, 2005, the Company had $6.7 billion in senior and subordinated notes outstanding that mature in varying amounts from 2006 to 2017, as compared to $6.9 billion at December31, 2004.
55 Table of Contents An additional source of funding for the Bank is provided by its global bank note program. Notes may be issued under this program with maturities of thirty days or more from the date of issue. At December31, 2005, the Bank had $4.4 billion in bank notes outstanding. The bank notes are included in long-term debt and senior and subordinated notes in the Companys balance sheet.
Subsidiary banks are members of various Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) that provide a source of funding through advances. These advances carry maturities from one month to 20 years. At December31, 2005, the Company had $1.5 billion of advances from the FHLBs. All FHLB borrowings are collateralized with mortgage-related assets which may include residential and commercial mortgages and home equity loans.
The Company also held $9.2 billion in available-for-sale investment securities, net of $5.1 billion in pledged available-for-sale investment securities and $4.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents at December31, 2005, compared to $7.7 billion in investment securities, net of $1.6 billion in pledged investment securities and $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents at December31, 2004. As of December31, 2005, the weighted average life of the investment securities was approximately 3.4 years. These investment securities, along with cash and cash equivalents, provide increased liquidity and flexibility to support the Companys funding requirements.
The Company has a $750.0 million credit facility committed through June 2007. The Company may take advances under the facility subject to covenants and conditions customary in a transaction of this nature. This facility may be used for general corporate purposes and was not drawn upon at December31, 2005.
Derivative Instruments The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements in order to manage interest rate exposure. In most cases, this exposure is related to the funding of fixed rate assets with floating rate obligations, including off-balance sheet securitizations. The Company also enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts and cross currency swaps to reduce sensitivity to changing foreign currency exchange rates. The hedging of foreign currency exchange rates is limited to certain intercompany obligations related to international operations. These derivatives expose the Company to certain credit risks. The Company has established policies and limits, as well as collateral agreements, to manage credit risk related to derivative instruments.
Additional information regarding derivative instruments can be found on pages 112-114 in Item8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 22.
IX. Market Risk Management Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk refers to changes in earnings or the net present value of assets and off-balance sheet positions less liabilities (termed economic value of equity) due to interest rate changes. To the extent that managed interest income and expense do not respond equally to changes in interest rates, or that all rates do not change uniformly, earnings and the economic value of equity could be affected. The Company manages and mitigates its interest rate sensitivity through several techniques, which include, but are not limited to, changing the maturity and repricing characteristics of various balance sheet categories and by entering into interest rate swaps.
The Companys measurement of interest rate risk considers both earnings and market value exposures. The consolidated balance sheet and all off-balance sheet positions are included in the analysis. The analysis reflects known balances and contractual maturities when available. Balance sheet positions lacking contractual maturities and those with a likelihood of maturity prior to their contractual term are assumed to mature consistent with business line expectations or, when available in the case of marketable securities, market expectations. As of December31, 2005, the Companys Asset/Liability Management Policy limited the change in projected 12-month net interest income due to instantaneous parallel rate shocks of +/-300 basis points to less than 3% of base net interest income. As of December31, 2005 the Company estimated a 1.2% reduction in 12-month net 56 Table of Contents interest income for an immediate 300 basis point rate increase and a 0.3% reduction in 12-month net interest income for an immediate 300 basis point rate decline.
In addition to limits related to possible changes in 12-month net interest income, as of December31, 2005 the Asset/Liability Management Policy limited the pre-tax change in economic value of equity due to instantaneous parallel rate shocks of 100 basis points to less than 6%. As of December31, 2005, the estimated reduction in economic value of equity due to an adverse 100 basis point rate shock was 2.8%.
The Company has revised its Asset/Liability Management Policy effective January31, 2006. The Company continues to limit the decline in 12-month net interest income due to an instantaneous parallel rate shock to less than 3% of base net interest income. The Company will now measure that risk over a +/- 200 basis point rate shock which better reflects the overall level of volatility in the market. The Company will also use the same rate shock for its economic value of equity limit. Accordingly, the economic value of equity limit has been scaled to 12% to reflect the increased rate shock.
The precision of the measures used to manage interest rate risk is limited due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying forecast assumptions. These measures do not consider the impact of the effects of changes in the overall level of economic activity associated with various interest rate scenarios. In addition, the measurement of interest rate sensitivity does not reflect the ability of management to take action to mitigate further exposure to changes in interest rates, including, within legal and competitive constraints, the repricing of interest rates on outstanding credit card loans.
Table 10 reflects the interest rate repricing schedule for earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as of December31, 2005.

In order to limit earnings exposure to foreign exchange risk, the Companys Asset/Liability Management Policy requires that material foreign currency denominated transactions be hedged. As of December31, 2005, the estimated reduction in 12-month earnings due to adverse foreign exchange rate movements corresponding to a 95% probability is less than 1%. The precision of this estimate is also limited due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying forecast assumptions.
X. Capital Capital Adequacy The Company and the Bank are subject to capital adequacy guidelines adopted by the Federal Reserve Board (the Federal Reserve) while the Savings Bank is subject to capital adequacy guidelines adopted by the Office of Thrift Supervision (the OTS) and the National Bank is subject to capital adequacy guidelines adopted by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC) (collectively, the regulators). The capital adequacy guidelines require the Company, the Bank, the Savings Bank and the National Bank to maintain specific capital levels based upon quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items. In addition, the Bank, Savings Bank and National Bank must also adhere to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.
The most recent notifications received from the regulators categorized the Bank, the Savings Bank and the National Bank as well-capitalized. As of December31, 2005, the Companys, the Banks, the Savings Banks and the National Banks capital exceeded all minimum regulatory requirements to which they were subject, and there were no conditions or events since the notifications discussed above that management believes would have changed either the Company, the Bank, the Savings Banks or the National Banks capital category.
The Bank and Savings Bank treat a portion of their loans as subprime under the Expanded Guidance for Subprime Lending Programs (the Subprime Guidelines) issued by the four federal banking agencies that comprise the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), and have assessed their capital and allowance for loan losses accordingly. Under the Subprime Guidelines, the Bank and Savings Bank each exceed the minimum capital adequacy guidelines as of December31, 2005. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
For purposes of the Subprime Guidelines, the Company has treated as subprime all loans in the Banks and the Savings Banks targeted subprime programs to customers either with a FICO score of 660 or below or with no FICO score. The Bank and the Savings Bank hold on average 200% of the total risk-based capital charge that would otherwise apply to such assets. This results in higher levels of regulatory capital at the Bank and the Savings Bank.
Additionally, regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the Bank, Savings Bank and National Bank to transfer funds to the Corporation. As of December31, 2005, retained earnings of the Bank, the Savings Bank and the National Bank of $464.1 million, $377.2 million and $30.3 million, respectively, were available for payment of dividends to the Corporation without prior approval by the regulators.
Additional information regarding capital adequacy can be found on pages105-106 in Item8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 18.
58 Table of Contents Dividend Policy Although the Company expects to reinvest a substantial portion of its earnings in its business, the Company also intends to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends on its common stock. The declaration and payment of dividends, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company and will depend upon the Companys results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Corporation will declare and pay any dividends. As a holding company, the ability of the Corporation to pay dividends is dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from its subsidiaries. Applicable banking regulations and provisions that may be contained in borrowing agreements of the Corporation or its subsidiaries may restrict the ability of the Corporations subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Corporation or the ability of the Corporation to pay dividends to its stockholders.
XI. Business Outlook This business outlook section summarizes the Companys expectations for earnings for 2006, and its primary goals and strategies for continued growth. The statements contained in this section are based on managements current expectations and do not take into account any acquisitions that might occur during the year. Certain statements are forward looking, and therefore actual results could differ materially from those in the Companys forward looking statements. Factors that could materially influence results are set forth throughout this section and in Item1A BusinessRisk Factors.
Expected Earnings The Company expects diluted earnings per share of $7.40 to $7.80, which represents an increase of between 10% and 16% over its diluted earnings per share of $6.73 in 2005. The company also expects its managed loan growth rate to be between 7% and 9% in 2006.
The Companys earnings are a function of its revenues (net interest income and non-interest income), consumer usage, payment and attrition patterns, the credit quality and growth rate of its earning assets (which affect fees, charge-offs and provision expense), the growth rate of its branches and deposits, and the Companys marketing and operating expenses. Specific factors likely to affect the Companys 2006 earnings are the portion of its loan portfolio it holds in higher credit quality assets, the level of off-balance sheet securitizations, changes in consumer payment behavior, the amount of and quality of deposits it generates, the competitive, legal, regulatory and reputational environment, the level of investments, growth in its businesses, and the health of the economy and its labor markets.
The Company expects to achieve these results based on the continued success of its business strategies and its current assessment of the competitive, regulatory and funding market environments that it faces (each of which is discussed elsewhere in this document), as well as the expectation that the geographies in which the Company competes will not experience significant consumer credit quality erosion, as might be the case in an economic downturn or recession.
Return on Managed Assets The Company expects continued stability in its annual return on managed assets, generally consistent with 2004 and 2005 managed ROA of 1.73% and 1.72% respectively. The Company expects a decline in revenue margin, due to its bias towards lower loss assets, which is expected to be offset primarily by reductions in provision expense and also by reductions in operating costs as a percent of assets.
The Companys objective is to continue expanding in consumer financial services, which may include expansion into additional geographic markets, additional bank branches, and other consumer loan products via organic 59 Table of Contents growth and/or acquisitions of other companies. In each business line, the Company expects to apply its proprietary marketing capabilities to identify new product and new market opportunities, and to make investment decisions based on the Companys extensive testing and analysis.
The Companys lending and deposit products are subject to intense competitive pressures that management anticipates will continue to increase as its markets mature, and it could affect the economics of decisions that the Company has made or will make in the future in ways that it did not anticipate, test or analyze.
U.S. Card Segment The Companys U.S. Card segment consisted of $49.5 billion of managed U.S. consumer credit card loans as of December31, 2005, marketed to consumers. The Companys strategy for its U.S. Card segment is to offer compelling, value-added products to its customers.
The competitive environment is currently intense for credit card products. Industry mail volume has increased substantially in recent years, resulting in declines in response rates to the Companys new customer solicitations over time. Additionally, the increase in other consumer loan products, such as home equity loans, puts pressure on growth throughout the credit card industry. These competitive pressures remain significant as a result of, among other things, increasing consolidation within the industry. The industrys response to this competitive pressure has been to increase mail volumes to record levels, and in some parts of the market, most notably, with respect to the prime revolver customers, offer extremely low up front pricing that appears to make profitability heavily dependent on penalty repricing well beyond go to rates for a substantial percentage of customers. The Company is choosing to limit its marketing in those selected parts of the market because it believes the prevailing pricing practices will compromise both economic returns and customer loyalty over the long term. Instead, the Company is focusing its efforts where it sees better opportunities to deliver profitable growth and create long term customer loyalty, such as in reward cards. Despite intense competitor pressure, the Company continues to believe that its marketing capabilities and credit risk management will enable it to originate new credit card accounts that exceed the Companys return on investment requirements.
Auto Finance Segment The Companys Auto Finance segment consisted of $16.4 billion of managed U.S. auto loans as of December31, 2005, marketed across the full credit spectrum, via direct and dealer marketing channels.
The 2005 acquisitions of Onyx Acceptance Corporation, the Key Bank non-prime portfolio, and the National Bank, along with its auto lending business, have strengthened the Auto Finance segments competitive position. The acquisitions have enhanced our ability to lend across the entire credit spectrum and provided operating scale. The Company expects to integrate these businesses more fully in 2006, and realize cost efficiencies and marketing synergies that will drive originations growth.
The Company believes that its strong risk management skills, increasing operating scale, full credit spectrum product offerings and multi-channel marketing approach will enable it to continue to increase market share in the Auto Finance industry.
Global Financial Services Segment The Global Financial Services segment consisted of $23.4 billion of managed loans as of December31, 2005, including international lending activities, small business lending, installment loans, home loans, point of sale financing and other consumer financial service activities.
The Company expects continued loan, credit and profit pressure from a deteriorating credit environment in its U.K. business. Despite this pressure, the Company continues to expect profitable long term growth from its U.K. business and is experiencing strong results from its North American business.
60 Table of Contents Banking With the acquisition of the National Bank on November16, 2005, Capital One entered the branch banking market. Because the transaction closed in the middle of the quarter, Hibernias results were not separately reported as a segment in the fourth quarter results. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006, a new banking segment will be disclosed, but it will not have the same mix of business as the former National Bank.
Hibernia has experienced a significant increase in deposits since the Gulf Coast Hurricanes in August 2005. The increase is partially due to customers receiving federal funds and insurance payments relating to the hurricanes. The Company expects that some of these incremental deposits will permanently remain with Hibernia, while others will be withdrawn and used for rebuilding or reinvestment in the Gulf Coast area.
The Company expects integration costs of around $90 million in 2006, and continues to expect total integration costs and operating synergies to be broadly in line with original estimates when the Hibernia transaction was announced in March 2005.

75 Table of Contents Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies Business The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Capital One Financial Corporation (the Corporation) and its subsidiaries. The Corporation is a diversified financial services company whose subsidiaries market a variety of financial products and services to consumers. The principal subsidiaries are Capital One Bank (the Bank), which offers credit card products and deposit products, Capital One, F.S.B. (the Savings Bank), which offers consumer and commercial lending and consumer deposit products, Capital One Auto Finance, Inc. (COAF), which offers automobile and other motor vehicle financing products and Hibernia National Bank (the National Bank) which offers a broad spectrum of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients. Capital One Services, Inc. (COSI), another subsidiary of the Corporation, provides various operating, administrative and other services to the Corporation and its subsidiaries.

Basis of Presentation The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) that require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior years amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2005 presentation.
The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments-an amendment of FASB Statements No.133 and 140, (SFAS 155). SFAS 155 amends FASB Statements No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, (SFAS 133) and No.140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, (SFAS 140) .
SFAS 155 resolves issues addressed in SFAS 133 Implementation Issue No. D1, Application of Statement 133 to Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets. SFAS 155 permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation, clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of SFAS 133, establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives, and amends SFAS 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument. SFAS 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after September15, 2006. The adoption of SFAS 155 is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated earnings or financial position of the Company.
In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.154, Accounting Changes and Error Correctionsa replacement of APB Opinion No.20 and FASB Statement No.3, (SFAS 154). SFAS 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement 76 Table of Contents in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005. The Company will apply the provisions of SFAS 154 when applicable in future reporting periods.
In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No.29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions , (SFAS 153). SFAS 153 requires exchanges of nonmonetary assets to be measured at the fair value of the assets exchanged. SFAS 153 applies to nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 153 did not have an impact on the consolidated earnings or financial position of the Company.
In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, (SFAS 123(R)) which requires compensation cost related to share-based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements, and that the cost be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an amendment in April 2005 deferring the effective date of SFAS 123 (R)to begin with the first interim or annual reporting period of the Companys fiscal year which would be after December15, 2005 for the Company. In December 2003, the Company adopted the expense recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation , (SFAS 123), under the prospective method allowed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean amendment of FASB Statement No.123 , (SFAS 148), to all awards granted, modified, or settled after January1, 2003. The provisions of SFAS 123(R) must be applied using the modified prospective method which requires the Company to recognize compensation expense for the unvested portion of all awards granted prior to January1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) will not have a material impact on the consolidated earnings or financial position of the Company.
In December 2003, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee (AcSEC) issued Statement of Position 03-3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer , (SOP 03-3). SOP 03-3 addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an initial investment in loans acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. It applies to individual loan purchases, portfolio purchases, and loans acquired in a purchase business combination. It does not apply to loans to borrowers in good standing under revolving credit agreements (which include credit cards and home equity loans), mortgage loans held for sale, and loans originated by the Company.
The Companys acquired loans, subject to SOP 03-3, are recorded at fair value and no separate valuation allowance is recorded at the date of acquisition. The Company reviews each loan at acquisition to determine if it should be accounted for under SOP 03-3 and if so, determines whether each such loan is to be accounted for individually or whether such loans will be aggregated into pools of loans based on common risk characteristics. The Company makes an estimate of the total cash flows it expects to collect from the loans (or pools of loans), which includes undiscounted expected principal and interest. The excess of that amount over the fair value of the loans is referred to as accretable yield. Accretable yield is recognized as interest income on a constant yield basis over the life of the loans. Any adjustments to the acquisition date fair value of the acquired loans made during the refinement of the allocation of purchase price will impact accretable yield. The Company also determines the loans contractual principal and contractual interest payments. The excess of that amount over the total cash flows it expects to collect from the loans is referred to as nonaccretable difference, which is not accreted into income. The Company continues to estimate cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the loans. Subsequent increases in total cash flows it expects to collect are recognized as an adjustment to the accretable yield with the amount of periodic accretion adjusted over the remaining life of the loans. Subsequent decreases in cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the loans are recognized as impairment in the current period through a valuation allowance. SOP 03-3 is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2004. See Note 7 for further discussion of SOP 03-3.
77 Table of Contents In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No.51 (FIN 46) .
In December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 46 (Revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, and Interpretation of ARB No.51 (FIN 46(R)) to provide clarification of certain provisions of FIN 46 as originally issued, and to defer the effective dates for certain entities. These interpretations address consolidation of business enterprises of variable interest entities (VIEs), which have certain characteristics. These characteristics include either that the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties; or that the equity investors in the entity lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The Company elected to early adopt the provisions of FIN 46 for the interim period ended September30, 2003. The Company has consolidated all material VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary, as defined under FIN 46, effective July1, 2003. The Company recorded premises and equipment of $139.8 million, other borrowings of $178.3 million and recognized a charge of $15.0 million, net of tax, for a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended December31, 2003.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and resale agreements and interest-bearing deposits at other banks. Cash paid for interest for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $1.9 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. Cash paid for income taxes for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $654.8 million, $705.1 million and $571.2 million, respectively.
Securities Available for Sale The Company classifies all debt securities as securities available for sale. These securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a component of cumulative other comprehensive income. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization or accretion is included in interest income. Realized gains and losses on sales of securities are determined using the specific identification method. The Company evaluates its unrealized loss positions for impairment in accordance with FASB Staff Position No.115-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments.
Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes earned finance charges and fee income on loans according to the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements. When the Company does not expect full payment of finance charges and fees, it does not accrue the estimated uncollectible portion as income (hereafter the suppression amount). To calculate the suppression amount, the Company first estimates the uncollectible portion of finance charge and fee receivables using a formula based on historical account migration patterns and current delinquency status. This formula is consistent with that used to estimate the allowance related to expected principal losses on reported loans. The suppression amount is calculated by adding any current period change in the estimate of the uncollectible portion of finance charge and fee receivables to the amount of finance charges and fees charged-off (net of recoveries) during the period. The Company subtracts the suppression amount from the total finance charges and fees billed during the period to arrive at total reported revenue. The amount of finance charge and fees suppressed were $1.0 billion, $1.1 billion and $2.0 billion for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Interchange income is a fee paid by a merchant bank to the card-issuing bank through the interchange network. Interchange fees are set by MasterCard International Inc. (MasterCard) and Visa U.S.A. Inc. (Visa) and are based on cardholder purchase volumes. The Company recognizes interchange income as earned.
Annual membership fees and direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized over one year on a straight-line basis. Dealer fees and premiums are deferred and amortized over the average life of the related loans using 78 Table of Contents the interest method for auto loan originations. Direct loan origination costs consist of both internal and external costs associated with the origination of a loan. Deferred fees (net of deferred costs) were $217.8 million and $302.5 million as of December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Rewards The Company offers credit cards that provide reward program members with various rewards such as airline tickets, free or deeply discounted products or cash rebates, based on purchase volume. The Company establishes a rewards liability based upon points earned which are ultimately expected to be redeemed and the average cost per point redemption. As points are redeemed, the rewards liability is relieved. The estimated cost of reward programs is reflected as a reduction to interchange income. The cost of reward programs related to securitized loans is deducted from servicing and securitizations income.
Loan Securitizations Loan securitization involves the transfer of a pool of loan receivables to a trust or other special purpose entity. The trust sells an undivided interest in the pool of loan receivables to third-party investors through the issuance of asset backed securities and distributes the proceeds to the Company as consideration for the loans transferred. The Company removes loan receivables from the Consolidated Balance Sheets for securitizations that qualify as sales in accordance with SFAS No.140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilitiesa Replacement of SFAS No.125 (SFAS 140). The trusts are qualified special purpose entities as defined by SFAS 140 and are not subsidiaries of the Company and are not included in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Gains on securitization transactions, fair value adjustments related to residual interests and earnings on the Companys securitizations are included in servicing and securitizations income in the Consolidated Statements of Income and amounts due from the trusts are included in accounts receivable from securitizations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The gain on sale recorded from off-balance sheet securitizations is based on the estimated fair value of the assets sold and retained and liabilities incurred, and is recorded at the time of sale, net of transaction costs, in servicing and securitizations income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The related receivable is the interest-only strip, which is based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows from excess finance charges and past-due fees over the sum of the return paid to security holders, estimated contractual servicing fees and credit losses. To the extent assumptions used by management do not prevail, fair value estimates of the interest-only strip could differ significantly, resulting in either higher or lower future servicing and securitization income, as applicable.
Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses is maintained at the amount estimated to be sufficient to absorb probable principal losses, net of principal recoveries (including recovery of collateral), inherent in the existing reported loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses is the periodic cost of maintaining an adequate allowance. The amount of allowance necessary is determined primarily based on a migration analysis of delinquent and current accounts, on forward loss curves and historical loss trends. The entire balance of an account is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the payment due date. In evaluating the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses, management takes into consideration the following factors: recent trends in delinquencies and charge-offs including bankrupt, deceased and recovered amounts; forecasting uncertainties and size of credit risks; the degree of risk inherent in the composition of the loan portfolio; economic conditions; legal and regulatory guidance; credit evaluations and underwriting policies; seasonality; and the value of the collateral supporting the loans. To the extent credit experience is not indicative of future performance or other assumptions used by management do not prevail, loss experience could differ significantly, resulting in either higher or lower future provision for loan losses, as applicable.
79 Table of Contents The Company generally charges off credit card loans at 180 days past the due date, and generally charges off other consumer loans, including auto loans, at 120 days past the due date or upon repossession of collateral. Commercial loans charge off when the amounts are deemed uncollectible. Bankrupt consumers accounts, excluding auto accounts, are generally charged-off within 30 days of receipt of the bankruptcy petition. Bankrupt auto accounts are charged-off at 120 days past the due date. Amounts collected on previously charged-off accounts related to principal are included in recoveries for the determination of net charge-offs. Costs to recover previously charged-off accounts are recorded as collection expense in other non-interest expense.
Commercial and certain small business loans are placed in nonaccrual status at 90 days past due or sooner if, in managements opinion, there is doubt concerning full collectibility of both principal and interest. Real estate secured loans are placed in nonaccrual status at 180 days past due.
Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Company capitalizes direct costs (including external costs for purchased software, contractors, consultants and internal staff costs) for internally developed software projects that have been identified as being in the application development stage. Depreciation and amortization expenses are computed generally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful lives for premises and equipment are as follows: buildings and improvements5-39 years; furniture and equipment3-10 years; computers and software3 years.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company performs annual impairment tests for acquisition goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142).
Other intangible assets that have a finite life are amortized on an accelerated basis over their respective estimated useful lives and evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. At December31, 2005, intangible assets included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet consist of core deposit intangibles, trust intangibles, lease intangibles and other intangibles.
Marketing The Company expenses marketing costs as incurred. Television advertising costs are expensed during the period in which the advertisements are aired.
Credit Card Fraud Losses The Company experiences fraud losses from the unauthorized use of credit cards. Transactions suspected of being fraudulent are charged to non-interest expense after a 60 day investigation period.
Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
Segments The accounting policies of operating and reportable segments, as defined by the Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information , (SFAS 131) are the same as those described elsewhere in this footnote. Revenue for all segments is derived from 80 Table of Contents external parties. Performance evaluation of and resource allocation to each reportable segment is based on a wide range of indicators to include both historical and forecasted operating results. See Note 3, Segments, for further discussion of the Companys operating and reportable segments.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities The Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value. These instruments are recorded in other assets or other liabilities on the balance sheet and in the operating section of the statement of cash flows as increases (decreases) of other assets and other liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains and losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in current earnings during the period of the change in fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item, if any, is recognized in current earnings during the period of change. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, the gain or loss is reported in other comprehensive income as part of the cumulative translation adjustment to the extent it is effective. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss is recognized in current earnings during the period of change in the fair value.
The Company formally documents all hedging relationships, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. The hedge instrument and the hedged item are designated at the execution of the hedge instrument or upon re-designation during the life of the hedge. At inception, at least quarterly or upon re-designation, the Company also formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the hedged items to which they are designated and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Hedge effectiveness is assessed and measured under identical time periods. To the extent that hedges qualify under paragraph 68 of SFAS 133, the Company uses the short-cut method to assess effectiveness. Otherwise, the Company utilizes the dollar-offset method or matches the significant terms of the derivative and hedge item to determine that the hedging transactions are/or have been highly effective. Changes in fair value of the hedged item and the hedge instrument are maintained over the life of the hedge and are recorded as of the last day of the month or quarter. The Company will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge.
Stock-Based Compensation Prior to 2003, the Company applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and related Interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. No compensation cost has been recognized for the Companys fixed stock options for years prior to 2003, as the exercise price of all such options equals or exceeds the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Effective January1, 2003, the Company adopted the expense recognition provisions of SFAS No.123, prospectively to all awards granted, modified, or settled after January1, 2003. Typically, awards under the 81 Table of Contents Companys plans vest over a three year period. Therefore, cost related to stock-based compensation included in net income for 2005, 2004 and 2003 is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value method had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of SFAS 123. The effect on net income and earnings per share if the fair value based method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period is presented in the table below.

Note 2 Business Combinations Hibernia Corporation On November16, 2005, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Hibernia Corporation (Hibernia), a financial holding company with operations in Louisiana and Texas. Hibernia offers a variety of banking products and services, including consumer, commercial and small business loans and demand and term deposit accounts.
The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, and, as such, the assets and liabilities of Hibernia were recorded at their respective fair values as of November16, 2005. The results of Hibernias operations were included in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income commencing November16, 2005.
The total consideration of $5.0 billion, which includes the value of outstanding stock options, was settled through the issuance of 32.9million shares of the Companys common stock and payment of $2.2 billion in cash. Under the terms of the transaction, each share of Hibernia common stock was exchanged for $30.46 in cash or 0.3792 shares of the Companys common stock or a combination of common stock and cash based on the aforementioned conversion rates, based on the average of the closing prices on the NYSE of the Companys common stock during the five trading days ending the day before the completion of the merger, which was $80.32.

Other 2005 Acquisitions During 2005, the Company closed acquisitions of Onyx Acceptance Corporation, a specialty auto loan originator; Hfs Group, a United Kingdom based home equity broker; InsLogic, an insurance brokerage firm and eSmartloan, a U.S. based online originator of home equity loans and mortgages, in all cash transactions. The acquisitions created approximately $391.4 million of goodwill, in the aggregate. See Note 17 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets on page 104 for further discussion. These acquisitions when considered individually or in aggregate under relevant disclosure guidance do not require the presentation of separate pro forma financial information.
Note 3 Segments The Company maintains three distinct operating segments: U.S. Card, Auto Finance, and Global Financial Services. The U.S. Card segment consists of domestic credit card lending activities. The Auto Finance segment consists of automobile and other motor vehicle financing activities. The Global Financial Services segment consists of international lending activities, small business lending, installment loans, home loans, healthcare financing and other diversified activities. The U.S. Card, Auto Finance and Global Financial Services segments are considered reportable segments based on quantitative thresholds applied to the managed loan portfolio for reportable segments provided by SFAS No.131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information , and are disclosed separately. The Other category includes the Companys liquidity portfolio, emerging businesses not included in the reportable segments and the banking business recently added through the acquisition of Hibernia Corporation, investments in external companies, and various non-lending activities. The Other category also includes the net impact of transfer pricing, certain unallocated expenses and gains/losses related to the securitization of assets.
As management makes decisions on a managed portfolio basis within each segment, information about reportable segments is provided on a managed basis. An adjustment to reconcile the managed financial information to the reported financial information in the consolidated financial statements is provided. This adjustment reclassifies a portion of net interest income, non-interest income and provision for loan losses into non-interest income from servicing and securitizations.
The Company maintains its books and records on a legal entity basis for the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The following tables present information prepared from the Companys internal 84 Table of Contents management information system, which is maintained on a line of business level through allocations from the consolidated financial results.
See Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, for the accounting policies of the reportable segments.

Of the additional allowance build, $10.0 million was allocated to the U.S. Card segment, $2.5 million was allocated to the Global Financial Services segment, and $16.0 million was allocated to the Auto Finance segment. The $15.6 million write-down of retained interests was held in the Other category. The impact of the hurricanes on Hibernia was reflected in Hibernias results prior to the acquisition.
Bankruptcy Legislation Impacts The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (new bankruptcy legislation) became effective in October 2005. As a result, the Company experienced a significant increase in bankruptcy related charge-offs during 2005 which is reflected in the provision for loan losses. The majority of the increase was allocated to the U.S. Card segment.
85 Table of Contents Non-recurring Operating Expense Items During the year ended December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company recognized non-interest expense of $76.3 million and $161.2 million, respectively, for employee termination and facility consolidation charges related to continued cost reduction initiatives and other less material one-time charges. Of these amounts, $41.7 million and $109.6 million was allocated to the U.S. Card segment, $24.9 million and $45.4 million was allocated to the Global Financial Services segment, $8.5 million and $4.5 million was allocated to the Auto Finance segment and the remainder was held in the Other category for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
During 2005, the Company closed on the sale of its Tampa, Florida facilities. The ultimate sales price was greater than the impaired value of the held-for-sale property, and as such, the Company reversed $18.8 million of its previously recorded 2004 impairment in Occupancy expense. Of this amount, $17.4 million was allocated to the U.S. Card segment, $1.3 million was allocated to the Global Financial Services segment, and the remainder of the balance was held in the Other category.
During 2005, the Company recognized a $20.6 million prepayment penalty for the refinancing of the McLean Headquarters facility. Of this amount, $16.8 million was allocated to the U.S. Card segment, $2.7 million was allocated to the Global Financial Services segment, $0.6 million was allocated to the Auto Finance segment, and the remainder of the balance was held in the Other category.
During 2005, the Company recognized a $28.2 million impairment charge related to the write-off of the Companys insurance brokerage business. The charge was recorded in non-interest expense and fully allocated to the Global Financial Services segment.
Other During, 2005, the Company sold previously purchased charged-off loan portfolios resulting in a gain of $34.0 million which was reported in non-interest income and held in the Other category.
During 2004, the Company sold its interest in a South African joint venture with a book value of $3.9 million to its joint venture partner. The Company received $26.2 million in cash, was forgiven $9.2 million in liabilities and recognized a pre-tax gain of $31.5 million. Also during 2004, the Company sold its French loan portfolio with a book value of $144.8 million to an external party. The Company received $178.7 million in cash, recorded $7.2 million in notes receivables and recognized a pre-tax gain of $41.1 million. The respective gains were recorded in non-interest income and reported in the Global Financial Services segment.
A $15.0 million ($23.9 million pre-tax) charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of FIN 46 was included in non-interest expense and reported in the Other category for segment reporting for the year ended December31, 2003.
Auto Loans During the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company sold auto loans of $257.7 million, $901.3 million and $1.9 billion, respectively. These transactions resulted in pre-tax gains allocated to the Auto Finance segment, inclusive of allocations related to funds transfer pricing of $4.5 million, $41.7 million and $57.3 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In addition the Company recognized an additional $12.5 million in gains related to the settlement of contingencies from prior period sales of auto receivables for the year ended December31, 2005.
During the year ended December31, 2004, the Company changed its practice for charging-off auto loans when notified of a bankruptcy. Auto loans in bankruptcy are now charged-off at 120 days past due. This change in practice resulted in the acceleration of $20.4 million in charge-offs for the Auto Finance segment in 2004.

U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government agency Obligations.
The unrealized losses on the Companys investments in U.S. Treasury obligations and direct obligations of U.S. government agencies were caused by interest rate increases. The contractual terms of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment. Because the Company has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December31, 2005 and 2004.
Collateralized Mortgage Obligations.
The unrealized losses on the Companys investment in collateralized mortgage obligations were caused by interest rate increases. Since the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality and because the Company has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December31, 2005 and 2004.
Mortgage-Backed Securities.
The unrealized losses of the Companys investment in federal agency mortgage-backed securities were caused by interest rate increases. The contractual cash flows of these investments are guaranteed by an agency of the U.S. government. Accordingly, it is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the Companys investment. Since the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality and because the Company has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December31, 2005 and 2004.
Asset-Backed Securities.
The unrealized losses on the Companys investments inasset-backed securityitems wereprimarily a reflection of the interest rate environment.Since the decline in market value is attributable toa risein interest rates and not credit quality and because the Company has the ability and intent to hold these 88 Table of Contents investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December31, 2005 and 2004.
Other.
The unrealized losses on the Companys investments in other items were a reflection of the interest rate environment. Since the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality and because the Company has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December31, 2005 and 2004.

Actual maturities could differ because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations.
Weighted average yields were determined based on amortized cost. Gross realized gains on sales of securities were $7.4 million, $1.3 million, and $10.5 million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Gross realized losses were $14.2 million, $24.4 million, and $19.9 million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Note 5 Allowance for Loan Losses The following is a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses: Year Ended December31 2005 2004 2003 Balance at beginning of year $ 1,505,000 $ 1,595,000 $ 1,720,000 Provision for loan losses 1,491,072 1,220,852 1,517,497 Acquisitions 224,144   Other (12,731 ) (15,284 ) 3,863 Charge-offs (1,865,836 ) (1,749,273 ) (2,004,328 ) Principal recoveries 448,351 453,705 357,968 Net charge-offs (1,417,485 ) (1,295,568 ) (1,646,360 ) Balance at end of year $ 1,790,000 $ 1,505,000 $ 1,595,000 Loans totaling approximately $422.3 million and $416.9 million, representing amounts which were greater than 90 days past due, were included in the Companys reported loan portfolio as of December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
89 Table of Contents Note 6 Loans The composition of the loan portfolio was as follows: December31 (In Thousands) 2005 2004 Year-End Balances: Reported loans: Consumer loans: Credit cards Domestic $ 16,389,054 $ 16,536,789 International 3,356,415 4,017,585 Total credit cards 19,745,469 20,554,374 Installment loans Domestic 5,763,538 4,475,838 International 551,460 493,846 Total installment loans 6,314,998 4,969,684 Auto loans 18,041,894 9,997,497 Mortgage loans 5,281,009  Total consumer loans 49,383,370 35,521,555 Small business loans 6,414,243 2,694,036 Commercial loans 4,050,068  Total reported loans $ 59,847,681 $ 38,215,591 As a result of the Gulf Coast Hurricanes, the Company adopted a policy to temporarily defer loan payments for consumer loans and selected small business and commercial loans to borrowers in the impacted areas. In most cases, the deferred payments are resulting in the extension of the underlying loan term. The past-due status of any delinquent loan was effectively frozen at the respective date of each of the hurricanes such that no further payment aging would occur. The deferral period for the majority of impacted loans is expected to lapse in January 2006. Additionally, the deferral had the impact of reducing charge-offs and transfers to nonperforming status.
90 Table of Contents Note 7 Loans Acquired in a Transfer In conjunction with the Hibernia merger transaction, the Company acquired certain loans for which there was, at acquisition, evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination and for which it was probable, at acquisition, that all contractually required payments would not be collected. Those loans are accounted for under Statement of Position 03-3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer (SOP 03-3) and are as follows: (In Thousands) 2005 Contractually required principal and interest at acquisition: Consumer $ 2,932,051 Small business 1,188,341 Commercial 911,965 Total $ 5,032,357 Nonaccretable difference (expected losses and foregone interest) 215,025 Cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition $ 4,817,332 Accretable yield (interest component of expected cash flows) 602,729 Basis in acquired loans at acquisition $ 4,214,603 The carrying amount of these loans is included in the balance sheet amounts of loans receivable at December31, 2005 and is as follows: December31, 2005 Consumer $ 2,428,886 Small business 925,412 Commercial 769,739 Total outstanding balance $ 4,124,037 Carrying Amount $ 3,938,394 Accretable Yield Balance at December31, 2004 $  Additions 602,729 Accretion (36,990 ) Balance at December31, 2005 $ 565,739 There were no loans acquired that were not accounted for using the income recognition model of SOP 03-03. The Company was able to reasonably estimate cash flows expected to be collected. Judgmental prepayment assumptions were applied to both contractually required payments and cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition for each portfolio to account for higher than average prepayments resulting from insurance proceeds for loans impacted by Gulf Coast Hurricanes.
91 Table of Contents Note 8 Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment were as follows: December31 2005 2004 Land $ 214,696 $ 106,627 Buildings and improvements 722,679 604,072 Furniture and equipment 796,668 731,026 Computer software 568,731 440,494 In process 134,525 98,774 2,437,299 1,980,993 Less: Accumulated depreciation and amortization (1,245,893 ) (1,163,289 ) Total premises and equipment, net $ 1,191,406 $ 817,704 Depreciation and amortization expense was $210.2 million, $224.3 million, and $260.6 million, for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
During 2004, the Company approved plans to liquidate certain facilities in Seattle, Washington and Tampa, Florida as part of its facility consolidation efforts. The premises met the held-for-sale criteria of SFAS No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (SFAS 144) and as such, an impairment charge of $54.0 million was recognized in non-interest expense during the year ended December31, 2004, to write down the properties to fair value less the estimated cost to sell. Depreciation expense was no longer being recognized for these assets. As of December31, 2004, the carrying value of these assets was $56.9 million.
During 2005, the Company closed on the sale of these facilities. The final sales price of the Tampa, Florida facility was greater than the recorded impaired value, and as such, the Company reversed $18.8 million of its previously recorded impairment in Occupancy expense during the year ended December31, 2005.
As discussed in Note 2Acquisitions, the Company completed its acquisition of Hibernia in November 2005. The acquisition added: $120.4 million in land, $186.9 million in buildings and improvements, $68.2 million of furniture and equipment, $13.2 million of computer software and $40.2 million of construction in process at December31, 2005, which are reflected in the table above.

Senior Notes Bank Notes Senior and Subordinated Global Bank Note Program The Senior and Subordinated Global Bank Note Program gives the Bank the ability to issue securities to both U.S. and non-U.S. lenders and to raise funds in U.S. and foreign currencies. The Senior and Subordinated Global Bank Note Program had $4.2 billion and $4.9 billion outstanding at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Prior to the establishment of the Senior and Subordinated Global Bank Note Program, the Bank issued senior unsecured debt through its $8.0 billion Senior Domestic Bank Note Program, of which $211.6 million and $231.6 million was outstanding at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Bank did not renew the Senior Domestic Bank Note Program for future issuances following the establishment of the Senior and Subordinated Global Bank Note Program.
During 2004, the Company issued $500.0 million of ten-year 5.125% fixed rate senior bank notes and $500.0 million of five-year 5.00% fixed rate senior bank notes under the Senior and Subordinated Global Bank Note Program.
In 2004, the Company repurchased senior bank notes in the amount of $124.5 million, which resulted in a pre-tax loss of $4.3 million.
93 Table of Contents Mandatory Convertible Securities In April 2002, the Company completed a public offering of mandatory convertible debt securities (the Upper Decs  ), that resulted in net proceeds of approximately $725.1 million. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. Each Upper Dec  initially consisted of and represented (i)a senior note due May17, 2007 with a principal amount of $50, on which the Company paid interest quarterly at the initial annual rate of 6.25%, and (ii)a forward purchase contract pursuant to which the holder agreed to purchase, for $50, shares of the Companys common stock on May17, 2005 (or earlier under certain conditions), with such number of shares determined based upon the average closing price per share of the Companys common stock for 20 consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the stock purchase date at a minimum per share price of $63.91 and a maximum per share price of $78.61. The minimum and maximum amount of shares issued by the Company was to be 9.5million and 11.7million shares, respectively.
The senior notes initially were pledged to secure the holders obligations under the forward purchase contracts. Each holder of an Upper Dec  was given the election to withdraw the pledged senior notes or treasury securities underlying the Upper Decs  by substituting, as pledged securities, specifically identified treasury securities that paid $50 on the relevant stock purchase date, which is the amount due on that date under each forward purchase contract.
In February of 2005, pursuant to the original terms of the Upper Decs mandatory convertible securities issued in April of 2002, the Company completed a remarketing of approximately $704.5 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% senior notes due May17, 2007. As a result of the remarketing, the annual interest rate on the senior notes was reset to 4.738%. Following the remarketing, the Company extinguished $585.0 million of the remarketed senior notes using the proceeds from the issuance of $300.0 million of seven year 4.80% fixed rate senior notes and $300.0 million of twelve year 5.25% fixed rate senior notes. The Company recognized a $12.4 million loss on the extinguishment of the remarketed senior notes.
In May 2005, the Company issued 10.4million shares of common stock resulting in proceeds of $747.5 million in accordance with the settlement provisions of the Upper DECs. The number of shares was based on the average closing price of $71.77 for the Companys stock calculated over the twenty trading days prior to the settlement.
Corporation Shelf Registration Statement As of December31, 2005, the Corporation has an effective shelf registration statement under which the Corporation from time to time may offer and sell senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, common equity units and stock purchase contracts. The Corporations shelf registration statement had $2.5 billion available at December31, 2005.
During 2005, the Company issued $500.0 million of ten year 5.50% fixed rate senior notes.

Other Borrowings Secured Borrowings COAF, a subsidiary of the Company, maintained nineteen agreements to transfer pools of consumer loans accounted for as secured borrowings at December31, 2005. The agreements were entered into between 2002 and 2005, relating to the transfers of pools of consumer loans totaling $21.2 billion. Principal payments on the borrowings are based on principal collections, net of losses, on the transferred consumer loans. The secured borrowings accrue interest predominantly at fixed rates and mature between April 2007 and December 2010, or 94 Table of Contents earlier depending upon the repayment of the underlying consumer loans. At December31, 2005 and 2004, $11.9 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively, of the secured borrowings were outstanding.
Junior Subordinated Capital Income Securities and Junior Subordinated Debentures In January 1997, Capital One Capital I, a subsidiary of the Bank created as a Delaware statutory business trust, issued $100.0 million aggregate amount of Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Capital Income Securities that mature on February1, 2027. The securities represent a preferred beneficial interest in the assets of the trust.
In November 2005, as part of the Hibernia acquisition, the Company assumed $51.5 million aggregate principal amount of 9.0% junior subordinated debentures due June30, 2032 and $10.3 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate (LIBOR plus 3.05%, reset quarterly) junior subordinated debentures due June30, 2033. The junior subordinated debentures were issued by a subsidiary of Hibernia to Coastal Capital Trust I (CCTI) and Coastal Capital Trust II (CCTII). CCTI and CCTII are considered business trusts. The trust preferred securities represent a beneficial interest in the assets of the business trusts.
FHLB Advances In connection with the Hibernia acquisition, the Company assumed $1.5 billion in Federal Reserve Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances which are secured by the Companys investment in FHLB stock and by a blanket floating lien on portions of the Companys residential mortgage loan portfolio. FHLB stock totaled $105.2 million at December31, 2005 and is included in securities available for sale.
Other Short-Term Borrowings Revolving Credit Facility In June 2004, the Company terminated its Domestic Revolving and Multicurrency Credit Facilities and replaced them with a new revolving credit facility (Credit Facility) providing for an aggregate of $750.0 million in unsecured borrowings from various lending institutions to be used for general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility is available to the Corporation, the Bank, the Savings Bank, and Capital One Bank, plc. The Corporations availability has been increased to $500.0 million under the Credit Facility. All borrowings under the Credit Facility are based upon varying terms of London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR).
Collateralized Revolving Credit Facilities In March 2005, COAF entered into a revolving warehouse credit facility collateralized by a security interest in certain auto loan assets (the Capital One Auto Loan Facility II). The Capital One Auto Loan Facility II has the capacity to issue up to $750.0 million in secured notes. The Capital One Auto Loan Facility II has a renewal date of March27, 2006. The facility does not have a final maturity date. Instead, the participant may elect to renew the commitment for another set period of time. Interest on the facility is based on commercial paper rates. At December31, 2005, $599.0 million was outstanding under the facility.
In April 2002, COAF entered into a revolving warehouse credit facility collateralized by a security interest in certain auto loan assets (the Capital One Auto Facility I).

Note 11 Employee Stock Ownership Plan As a result of the acquisition of Hibernia, the Company now has an internally-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) in which substantially all former employees of Hibernia participate.

Dividends received by the ESOP in 2005 were used to pay debt service, and it is anticipated this practice will continue in the future.
The ESOP shares initially were pledged as collateral for its debt. As the debt is repaid, shares are released from collateral and allocated to active participants. The remaining collateral shares are reported as a reduction to paid-in capital in equity. As shares are committed to be released, the Company reports compensation expense equal to the current market value of the shares, and the shares become outstanding for earnings per share calculations. Dividends on allocated ESOP shares are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings; dividends on unallocated ESOP shares are recorded as a reduction of contributions due to the ESOP.
Compensation expense of $0.7 million relating to the ESOP was recorded by the Company for the year ended December31, 2005. The ESOP held 705,178 allocated shares and 244,401 suspense shares at December31, 2005. The fair value of the suspense shares at December31, 2005 was $21.1 million.

105 Table of Contents The Bank and Savings Bank treat a portion of their loans as subprime under the Expanded Guidance for Subprime Lending Programs (the Subprime Guidelines) issued by the four federal banking agencies that comprise the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), and have assessed their capital and allowance for loan losses accordingly. Under the Subprime Guidelines, the Bank and Savings Bank each exceed the minimum capital adequacy guidelines as of December31, 2005. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
For purposes of the Subprime Guidelines, the Company has treated as subprime all loans in the Banks and the Savings Banks targeted subprime programs to customers either with a FICO score of 660 or below or with no FICO score. The Bank and the Savings Bank hold on average 200% of the total risk-based capital charge that would otherwise apply to such assets. This results in higher levels of regulatory capital at the Bank and the Savings Bank.
Additionally, regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the Bank, Savings Bank and National Bank to transfer funds to the Corporation. As of December31, 2005, retained earnings of the Bank, the Savings Bank and the National Bank of $464.1 million, $377.2 million and $30.3 million, respectively, were available for payment of dividends to the Corporation without prior approval by the regulators.

The majority of the standby letters of credit consist of financial guarantees. Collateral requirements are similar to those for funded transactions and are established based on managements credit assessment of the customer. Management conducts regular reviews of all outstanding standby letters of credit and customer acceptances, and the results of these reviews are considered in assessing the adequacy of the Companys allowance for loan losses.
The Company had contractual amounts of standby letters of credit of $569.2 million at December31, 2005. As of December31, 2005, standby letters of credit had expiration dates ranging from 2006 to 2010.

Loan and Line of Credit Commitments As of December31, 2005, the Company had approximately $156.8 billion of unused credit card lines. While this amount represented the total unused available credit card lines, the Company has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all of its customers will exercise their entire available line at any given point in time. The Company generally has the right to increase, reduce, cancel, alter or amend the terms of these available lines of credit at any time.
As a result of the acquisition of Hibernia, the Company enters into commitments to extend credit that are legally binding conditional agreements having fixed expirations or termination dates and specified interest rates and purposes. These commitments generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards. Collateral requirements and loan-to-value ratios are the same as those for funded transactions and are established based on 106 Table of Contents managements credit assessment of the customer. Commitments may expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future requirements. The outstanding unfunded commitments to extend credit other than credit card lines were approximately $4.7 billion as of December31, 2005.
Lease Commitments Certain premises and equipment are leased under agreements that expire at various dates through 2035, without taking into consideration available renewal options. Many of these leases provide for payment by the lessee of property taxes, insurance premiums, cost of maintenance and other costs. In some cases, rentals are subject to increases in relation to a cost of living index. Total rent expenses amounted to approximately $68.1 million, $38.5 million, and $63.7 million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Future minimum rental commitments as of December31, 2005, for all non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more are as follows: 2006 $ 57,503 2007 53,132 2008 45,399 2009 34,437 2010 19,973 Thereafter 73,476 Total $ 283,920 Minimum sublease rental income of $7.4 million, due in future years under noncancelable leases, has not been included in the table above as a reduction to minimum lease payments.
Funding Commitments Related to Synthetic Fuel Tax Credit Transactions In June of 2004 and July of 2005, the Company, through two separate transactions and two consolidated special purpose entities (SPVs), purchased minority ownership interests in two entities established to operate facilities which produce a coal-based synthetic fuel that qualifies for tax credits pursuant to Section29 of the Internal Revenue Code. The SPVs purchased their minority interests from third parties paying $2.6 million in cash and agreeing to pay an estimated $159.1 million comprised of fixed note payments, variable payments and the funding of their share of operating losses sufficient to maintain their minority ownership percentages. Actual total payments will be based on the amount of tax credits generated through the end of 2007. In exchange, the SPVs will receive an estimated $192.0 million in tax benefits resulting from a combination of deductions, allocated operating losses, and tax credits. The Corporation has guaranteed the SPVs commitments under the purchase agreements. As of December31, 2005, the Company has recorded $66.2 million in tax benefits and had an estimated remaining commitment for fixed note payments, variable payments and the funding of their proportionate share of the operating losses totaling $104.6 million.
Guarantees Residual Value Guarantees In December 2000, the Company entered into a 10-year agreement for the lease of the headquarters building being constructed in McLean, Virginia. The agreement called for monthly rent to commence upon completion, which occurred in the first quarter of 2003, and is based on LIBOR rates applied to the cost of the building funded. If, at the end of the lease term, the Company does not purchase the property, the Company guarantees a maximum residual value of up to $114.8 million representing approximately 72% of the $159.5 million cost of the building. This agreement, made with a multi-purpose entity that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of one of the 107 Table of Contents Companys lenders, provides that in the event of a sale of the property, the Companys obligation would be equal to the sum of all amounts owed by the Company under a note issuance made in connection with the lease inception. As of December31, 2005, the value of the building was estimated to be above the maximum residual value that the Company guarantees; thus, no deficiency existed and no liability was recorded relative to this property. During 2005, the Company notified the lender of its intention to purchase the property in 2006 and as such incurred a $20.6 million pre-payment penalty related to the refinancing of the McLean headquarters facility.
Other Guarantees In connection with certain installment loan securitization transactions, the transferee (off-balance sheet special purpose entity receiving the installment loans) entered into interest rate hedge agreements (the swaps) with a counterparty to reduce interest rate risk associated with the transaction. In connection with the swaps, the Corporation entered into letter agreements guaranteeing the performance of the transferee under the swaps. If at anytime the ClassA invested amount equals zero and the notional amount of the swap is greater than zero resulting in an Early Termination Date (as defined in the securitization transactions Master Agreement), then (a)to the extent that, in connection with the occurrence of such Early Termination Date, the transferee is obligated to make any payments to the counterparty pursuant to the Master Agreement, the Corporation shall reimburse the transferee for the full amount of such payment and (b)to the extent that, in connection with the occurrence of an Early Termination Date, the transferee is entitled to receive any payment from the counterparty pursuant to the Master Agreement, the transferee will pay to the Corporation the amount of such payment. At December31, 2005, the maximum exposure to the Corporation under the letter agreements was approximately $18.2 million.
Industry Litigation Over the past several years, MasterCard International and Visa U.S.A., Inc., as well as several of their member banks, have been involved in several different lawsuits challenging various practices of MasterCard and Visa.
In 1998, the United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against the MasterCard and Visa membership associations composed of financial institutions that issue MasterCard or Visa credit or debit cards (associations), alleging, among other things, that the associations had violated antitrust law and engaged in unfair practices by not allowing member banks to issue cards from competing brands, such as American Express and Discover Financial Services. In 2001, a New York district court entered judgment in favor of the Department of Justice and ordered the associations to repeal these policies. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the district court and, on October4, 2004, the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari in the case. In November 2004, American Express filed an antitrust lawsuit (the Amex lawsuit) against the associations and several member banks alleging that the associations and member banks jointly and severally implemented and enforced illegal exclusionary agreements that prevented member banks from issuing American Express and Discover cards. The complaint requests civil monetary damages, which could be trebled. The Corporation, the Bank, and the Savings Bank are named defendants in this lawsuit.
Separately, a number of entities, each purporting to represent a class of retail merchants, have also filed antitrust lawsuits (the Interchange lawsuits) against the associations and several member banks, including the Corporation and its subsidiaries, alleging among other things, that the associations and member banks conspired to fix the level of interchange fees. The complaints request civil monetary damages, which could be trebled. In October 2005, the Interchange lawsuits were consolidated before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.
We believe that we have meritorious defenses with respect to these cases and intend to defend these cases vigorously. At the present time, management is not in a position to determine whether the resolution of these cases will have a material adverse effect on either the consolidated financial position of the Corporation or the Corporations results of operations in any future reporting period.
108 Table of Contents In addition, several merchants filed class action antitrust lawsuits, which were subsequently consolidated, against the associations relating to certain debit card products. In April 2003, the associations agreed to settle the lawsuit in exchange for payments to plaintiffs and for changes in policies and interchange rates for debit cards. Certain merchant plaintiffs have opted out of the settlements and have commenced separate lawsuits. Additionally, consumer class action lawsuits with claims mirroring the merchants allegations have been filed in several courts. Finally, the associations, as well as certain member banks, continue to face additional lawsuits regarding policies, practices, products and fees.
With the exception of the Interchange lawsuits and the Amex lawsuit, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are not parties to the lawsuits against the associations described above and therefore will not be directly liable for any amount related to any possible or known settlements of such lawsuits. However, the Corporations subsidiary banks are member banks of MasterCard and Visa and thus may be affected by settlements or lawsuits relating to these issues, including changes in interchange payments. In addition, it is possible that the scope of these lawsuits may expand and that other member banks, including the Corporations subsidiary banks, may be brought into the lawsuits or future lawsuits. The associations are also subject to additional litigation, including suits regarding foreign exchange fees. As a result of such litigation, the associations are expected to continue to evolve as corporate entities, including by changing their governance structures, as previously announced by the associations.
Given the complexity of the issues raised by these lawsuits and the uncertainty regarding: (i)the outcome of these suits, (ii)the likelihood and amount of any possible judgments, (iii)the likelihood, amount and validity of any claim against the associations member banks, including the banks and the Corporation, and (iv)changes in industry structure that may result from the suits and (v)the effects of these suits, in turn, on competition in the industry, member banks, and interchange and association fees, we cannot determine at this time the long-term effects of these suits on us.
Other Pending and Threatened Litigation In addition, the Company also commonly is subject to various pending and threatened legal actions relating to the conduct of its normal business activities. In the opinion of management, the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of any such pending or threatened legal actions will not be material to the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.
Tax issues for years 1995-1999 are pending in the U.S. Tax court. The ultimate resolution of these issues is not expected to have a materially adverse effect upon the Corporations operations or financial condition.
Note 20 Related Party Transactions In the ordinary course of business, executive officers and directors of the Company may have consumer loans issued by the Company. Pursuant to the Companys policy, such loans are issued on the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans to unrelated persons and do not involve more than the normal risk of collectibility.
Note 21 Off-Balance Sheet Securitizations Off-balance sheet securitizations involve the transfer of pools of consumer loan receivables by the Company to one or more third-party trusts or qualified special purpose entities in transactions that are accounted for as sales in accordance with SFAS 140. Certain undivided interests in the pool of consumer loan receivables are sold to investors as asset-backed securities in public underwritten offerings or private placement transactions. The proceeds from off-balance sheet securitizations are distributed by the trusts to the Company as consideration for 109 Table of Contents the consumer loan receivables transferred. Each new off-balance sheet securitization results in the removal of consumer loan principal receivables equal to the sold undivided interests in the pool from the Companys consolidated balance sheet (off-balance sheet loans), the recognition of certain retained residual interests and a gain on the sale. The remaining undivided interests in principal receivables of the pool, as well as the unpaid billed finance charge and fee receivables related to the Companys undivided interest in the principal receivables are retained by the Company and recorded as consumer loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amounts of the remaining undivided interests fluctuate as the accountholders make principal payments and incur new charges on the selected accounts. The amount of retained consumer loan receivables was $11.0 billion and $10.3 billion as of December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
The following table presents the year-end and average balances, as well as the delinquent and net charge-off amounts of the reported, off-balance sheet and managed consumer loan portfolios.
Supplemental Loan Information Year Ended December31 2005 2004 Loans Outstanding Loans Delinquent Loans Outstanding Loans Delinquent Managed loans $ 105,527,491 $ 3,423,820 $ 79,861,299 $ 3,054,078 Securitization adjustments (45,679,810 ) (1,544,812 ) (41,645,708 ) (1,581,884 ) Reported consumer loans $ 59,847,681 $ 1,879,008 $ 38,215,591 $ 1,472,194 Average Loans Net Charge- Offs Average Loans Net Charge- Offs Managed loans $ 85,265,023 $ 3,623,152 $ 73,711,673 $ 3,251,761 Securitization adjustments (44,530,786 ) (2,176,503 ) (39,446,005 ) (1,956,193 ) Reported consumer loans $ 40,734,237 $ 1,446,649 $ 34,265,668 $ 1,295,568 The Companys retained residual interests in the off-balance sheet securitizations are recorded in accounts receivable from securitizations and are comprised of interest-only strips, retained subordinated undivided interests in the transferred receivables, cash collateral accounts, cash reserve accounts and unpaid interest and fees on the investors portion of the transferred principal receivables. The interest-only strip is recorded at fair value, while the other residual interests are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Retained residual interests totaled $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Companys retained residual interests are generally restricted or subordinated to investors interests and their value is subject to substantial credit, repayment and interest rate risks on the transferred financial assets. The investors and the trusts have no recourse to the Companys assets, other than the retained residual interests, if the off-balance sheet loans are not paid when due.
The gain on sale recorded from off-balance sheet securitizations is based on the estimated fair value of the assets sold and retained and liabilities incurred, and is recorded at the time of sale, net of transaction costs, in servicing and securitizations income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The related receivable is the interest-only strip, which is based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows from excess finance charges and past-due fees over the sum of the return paid to security holders, estimated contractual servicing fees and credit losses. The Company periodically reviews the key assumptions and estimates used in determining the value of the interest-only strip. The Company recognizes all changes in the fair value of the interest-only strip immediately in servicing and securitizations income on the consolidated statements of income in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities . In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force 99-20 (EITF 99-20) , Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment of Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets , the interest component of cash flows attributable to retained interests in securitizations is recorded in other interest income.
110 Table of Contents The key assumptions used in determining the fair value of the interest-only strips resulting from securitizations of consumer loan receivables completed during the period included the weighted average ranges for charge-off rates, principal repayment rates, lives of receivables and discount rates included in the following table. The charge-off rates are determined using forecasted net charge-offs expected for the trust calculated consistently with other company charge-off forecasts. The principal repayment rate assumptions are determined using actual and forecasted trust principal repayment rates based on the collateral. The lives of receivables are determined as the number of months necessary to pay off the investors given the principal repayment rate assumptions. The discount rates are determined using primarily trust specific statistics and forward rate curves, and are reflective of what market participants would use in a similar valuation.
Securitization Key Assumptions YearEnded December31 2005 2004 Weighted average life for receivables (months) 9to10 8to9 Principal repayment rate (weighted average rate) 13%to14 % 13%to15 % Charge-off rate (weighted average rate) 4%to5 % 4%to5 % Discount rate (weighted average rate) 9%to13 % 8%to10 % If these assumptions are not met, or if they change, the interest-only strip and related servicing and securitizations income would be affected. The following adverse changes to the key assumptions and estimates, presented in accordance with SFAS 140, are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the figures indicate, any change in fair value based on a 10% or 20% variation in assumptions cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of a change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the interest-only strip is calculated independently from any change in another assumption. However, changes in one factor may result in changes in other factors, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities.
Securitization Key Assumptions and Sensitivities As of December31 2005 2004 Interest-only strip $ 419,196 $ 344,119 Weighted average life for receivables (months) 9 9 Principal repayment rate (weighted average rate) 14 % 14 % Impact on fair value of 10% adverse change $ (13,802 ) $ (16,280 ) Impact on fair value of 20% adverse change (25,203 ) (28,621 ) Charge-off rate (weighted average rate) 4 % 5 % Impact on fair value of 10% adverse change $ (62,326 ) $ (66,014 ) Impact on fair value of 20% adverse change (124,536 ) (131,938 ) Discount rate (weighted average rate) 13 % 9 % Impact on fair value of 10% adverse change $ (2,202 ) $ (1,788 ) Impact on fair value of 20% adverse change (4,378 ) (3,551 ) Static pool credit losses are calculated by summing the actual and projected future credit losses and dividing them by the original balance of each pool of assets. Due to the short-term revolving nature of the consumer loan receivables, the weighted average percentage of static pool credit losses is not considered materially different from the assumed charge-off rates used to determine the fair value of the retained interests.
The Company acts as a servicing agent and receives contractual servicing fees of between 0.50% and 6% of the investor principal outstanding, based upon the type of assets serviced. The Company generally does not record material servicing assets or liabilities for these rights since the contractual servicing fee approximates market rates.
111 Table of Contents Securitization Cash Flows Year Ended December31 2005 2004 Proceeds from new securitizations $ 9,482,333 $ 10,854,927 Collections reinvested in revolving-period securitizations 76,224,390 63,050,917 Repurchases of accounts from the trust 391,118 240,932 Servicing fees received 846,535 766,883 Cash flows received on retained interests (1) 4,076,128 3,730,012 (1) Includes all cash receipts of excess spread and other payments (excluding servicing fees) from the Trust to the Company.
For the year ended December31, 2005, the Company recognized gross gains of $58.2 million on the sale of $9.5billion of consumer loan principal receivables compared to gross gains of $55.8 million on the sale of $10.9billion of consumer loan principal receivables for the year ended December31, 2004 and gross gains of $62.0million on the sale of $11.5 billion of consumer loans in 2003. These gross gains are included in servicing and securitizations income. In addition, the Company recognized, as a reduction to servicing and securitizations income, upfront securitization transaction costs and recurring credit facility commitment fees of $48.6million, $69.0million and $88.6million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The remainder of servicing and securitizations income represents servicing income and excess interest and non-interest income generated by the transferred receivables, less the related net losses on the transferred receivables and interest expense related to the securitization debt.
Note 22 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities The Company maintains a risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate and foreign exchange rate volatility. The Companys goal is to manage sensitivity to changes in rates by modifying the repricing or maturity characteristics of certain balance sheet assets and liabilities, thereby limiting the impact on earnings. By using derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to credit and market risk. The Company manages the market risk associated with interest rate and foreign exchange contracts by establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken. Credit risk is equal to the extent of the fair value gain in a derivative, if the counterparty fails to perform. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, this generally indicates that the counterparty owes the Company, and, therefore, creates a repayment risk for the Company. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, the Company owes the counterparty, and therefore, has no repayment risk. The Company minimizes the credit (or repayment) risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties that are reviewed periodically by the Companys Asset and Liability Committee, a committee of Senior Management. The Company also maintains a policy of requiring that all derivative contracts be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association Master Agreement; depending on the nature of the derivative transaction, bilateral collateral agreements may be required as well.
The Company periodically uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps generally involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on a common notional principal amount and maturity date. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged assets and liabilities will appreciate or depreciate in market value. To the extent that there is a high degree of correlation between the hedged asset or liability and the derivative instrument, the income or loss generated will generally offset the effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation.
The Companys foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities expose it to foreign currency exchange risk. The Company enters into various foreign exchange derivative contracts for managing foreign currency exchange risk. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument effectively offset the related foreign exchange gains or losses on the items to which they are designated.
112 Table of Contents The Company has non-trading derivatives that do not qualify as hedges. These derivatives are carried at fair value and changes in value are included in current earnings.
The Asset and Liability Management Committee, as part of that committees oversight of the Companys asset/liability and treasury functions, monitors the Companys derivative activities. In accordance with the Companys asset/liability management policies, the Company reviews its risk profile on a monthly basis. The Companys Asset and Liability Management Committee is responsible for approving hedging strategies. The resulting strategies are then incorporated into the Companys overall interest rate risk management strategies.
Fair Value Hedges The Company has entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated investments against fluctuations in exchange rates. The purpose of the Companys foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the Company from the risk of adverse effects from movements in exchange rates.
The Company has also entered into interest rate swap agreements that modify the Companys exposure to interest rate risk by effectively converting a portion of the Companys brokered and public fund certificates of deposit and senior notes from fixed rates to variable rates over the next nine years.
Net gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of the Companys fair value hedging instruments were not material for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004.
Cash Flow Hedges The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively modify the Companys exposure to interest rate risk by converting floating rate debt to a fixed rate over the next seven years. The agreements involve the receipt of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreement without an exchange of underlying principal amounts.
The Company periodically enters into currency swaps that effectively convert fixed rate foreign currency denominated interest receipts to fixed dollar interest receipts on foreign currency denominated assets. The purpose of these hedges is to protect against adverse movements in exchange rates. As of December31, 2005, the Company was not a party to any cross currency swaps.
The Company has entered into forward exchange contracts to reduce the Companys sensitivity to foreign currency exchange rate changes on its foreign currency denominated loans. The forward rate agreements allow the Company to lock-in functional currency equivalent cash flows associated with the foreign currency denominated loans.
During the year ended December31, 2005, the Company recognized $3.1 million of losses, recorded in other non-interest income, related to the ineffective portions of its cash flow hedging instruments. During the year ended December31, 2004, the Company recognized no net gains or losses related to the ineffective portions of its cash flow hedging instruments. The Company recognized no net gains or losses during the years ended December31, 2005 and December31, 2004 for cash flow hedges that have been discontinued because the forecasted transaction was no longer probable of occurring.
At December31, 2005, the Company expects to reclassify $16.9 million of net losses, after tax, on derivative instruments from cumulative other comprehensive income to earnings during the next 12 months as terminated swaps are amortized and as interest payments and receipts on derivative instruments occur.
Hedge of Net Investment in Foreign Operations The Company uses forward exchange contracts to protect the value of its investment in its foreign subsidiaries. Realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses from these hedges are not included in the income 113 Table of Contents statement, but are shown in the translation adjustments in other comprehensive income. The purpose of these hedges is to protect against adverse movements in exchange rates.
For the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, net gains of $0.3 million and net losses of $9.1 million, respectively, related to these derivatives were included in the cumulative translation adjustment.
Non-Trading Derivatives The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate sensitivity related to loan securitizations. The Company enters into interest rate swaps with its securitization trust and essentially offsets the derivative with separate interest rate swaps with third parties.
The Company uses interest rate swaps in conjunction with its auto securitizations. These swaps have zero balance notional amounts unless the paydown of auto securitizations differs from its scheduled amortization.
The Company enters into customer-oriented derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, options, caps, floors, and foreign exchange contracts. These customer-oriented positions are matched with offsetting positions to minimize risk to the Company.
These derivatives do not qualify as hedges and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in value included in current earnings. During the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had net gains of $6.6 million and $4.0 million, respectively, which are recorded in other non-interest income.
Note 23 Significant Concentration of Credit Risk The Company is active in originating loans in the United States and internationally. International loans are originated primarily in Canada and the United Kingdom. The Company reviews each potential customers credit application and evaluates the applicants financial history and ability and willingness to repay. Loans are made on an unsecured and secured basis. Certain commercial, small business, mortgage and automobile loans require collateral in various forms including cash deposits, automobiles and real estate, as appropriate. The geographic distribution of the Companys loans was as follows: December31 2005 2004 Loans Percentage of Total Loans Percentage of Total Geographic Region: Domestic South $ 44,959,029 42.60 % $ 25,034,582 31.34 % West 18,225,986 17.27 15,873,159 19.88 Midwest 17,091,800 16.20 15,220,162 19.06 Northeast 14,601,852 13.84 13,198,619 16.53 Total Domestic 94,878,667 89.91 % 69,326,522 86.81 % International U.K.

In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument. As required under GAAP, these disclosures exclude certain financial instruments and all non-financial instruments. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company.
The Company, in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments as of December31, 2005 and 2004, used the following methods and assumptions: Financial Assets Cash and cash equivalents The carrying amounts of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and resale agreements and interest-bearing deposits at other banks approximate fair value.
Securities available for sale The fair value of securities available for sale was determined using current market prices. See Note 4 for fair values by type of security.
Loans The net carrying amount of credit card loans approximates fair value due to the relatively short average life and variable interest rates on a substantial number of these loans. This amount excluded any value related to account relationships.
The fair value of loans other than credit card loans was estimated by discounting future cash flows using a rate at which similar portfolios of loans would be made under current conditions.
Interest receivable The carrying amount approximates the fair value of this asset due to its relatively short-term nature.
Accounts receivable from securitizations The carrying amount approximates fair value.
Derivatives The carrying amount of derivatives approximates fair value and was estimated using present value valuation techniques. This value generally reflects the estimated amounts that the Company would have received to terminate the interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign currency exchange (f/x) contracts at the respective dates, taking into account the forward yield curve on the swaps and the forward rates on the currency swaps and f/x contracts. These derivatives are included in other assets on the balance sheet.
Financial Liabilities Non-interest bearing deposits The carrying amount approximates fair value.
115 Table of Contents Interest-bearing deposits The fair value of interest-bearing deposits was calculated by discounting the future cash flows using estimates of market rates for corresponding contractual terms.
Other borrowings The carrying amount of federal funds purchased and resale agreements, FHLB advances, and other short-term borrowings approximates fair value. The fair value of secured borrowings was calculated by discounting the future cash flows using estimates of market rates for corresponding contractual terms and assumed maturities when no stated final maturity was available. The fair value of the junior subordinated capital income securities and junior subordinated debentures were determined based on quoted market prices.
Senior and subordinated notes The fair value of senior and subordinated notes was determined based on quoted market prices.
Interest payable The carrying amount approximates the fair value of this liability due to its relatively short-term nature.
Derivatives The carrying amount of derivatives approximates fair value and was estimated using present value valuation techniques.

119 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of Capital One Financial Corporation (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the SEC, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Companys principal executive and principal financial officers, and effected by the companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The Companys internal control over financial reporting is supported by written policies and procedures, that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Companys assets; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Companys management and directors; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management of the Company conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO Framework). As allowed for by the SEC under the current year acquisition scope exception, managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting excludes the evaluation of the internal controls over financial reporting of Hibernia Corporation and its subsidiaries (Hibernia), which were acquired on November16, 2005. Hibernia represents approximately $27.8 billion of total assets and $39.6 million of net assets as of December 31, 2005 and approximately $163.2 million of revenues and $30.6 million of net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, of our consolidated financial statements.
Based on this assessment, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2005.
Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 has been audited by Ernst and Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Companys financial statements, as stated in their report, a copy of which is included in this annual report on Form 10-K.
