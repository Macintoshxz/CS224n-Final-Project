Business.  Overview       Capital One Financial Corporation (the "Corporation"), is a holding company, incorporated in Delaware on July 21, 1994, whose subsidiaries provide a variety of products and services to consumers using its proprietary information- based strategy ("IBS"). The Corporation's principal subsidiary, Capital One Bank (the "Bank"), a limited-purpose Virginia state chartered credit card bank, offers credit card products. The Bank originally conducted its operations as a division of Signet Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Signet Banking Corporation ("Signet")./1/ Capital One, F.S.B. (the "Savings Bank"), a federally chartered savings bank, offers consumer lending and deposit products. Capital One Services, Inc., another subsidiary of the Corporation, provides various operating, administrative and other services to the Corporation and its subsidiaries. Unless indicated otherwise, the terms "Company", "we", "us", and "our" refer to the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries and for periods prior to our separation from Signet Bank, Signet Bank's credit card division.       We began operations in 1953 as part of Signet Bank, the same year as the formation of what is now MasterCard International, and we are one of the oldest continually operating bank card issuers in the United States. The Bank separated from Signet on November 24, 1994 and became a subsidiary of the Corporation. As of December 31, 2000, we had 33.8 million customers and $29.5 billion in managed consumer loans outstanding. We are among the ten largest issuers of Visa and MasterCard credit cards in the United States based on managed credit card loans outstanding as of December 31, 2000. The success of our IBS, which we initiated in 1988, in addition to credit card industry dynamics, has led to our growth in managed credit card loans and accounts.       In June 1996, we established the Savings Bank to expand our product offerings and our relationship with our cardholders. The Savings Bank currently takes deposits and offers a variety of credit card and installment loan products. Through the Savings Bank, we expect to offer multiple financial products and services to existing cardholders and other households applying IBS and existing information technology systems.       We offer credit card products outside of the United States through Capital One Bank (Europe) plc, an indirect subsidiary of the Bank organized and located in the United Kingdom (the "UK Bank"), through a branch of the Bank in Canada, and through our involvement in a joint venture with a South African financial institution. We currently have foreign operations primarily in the United Kingdom and Canada, with additional operations in South Africa and France. We may also, from time to time, consider establishing our business in additional foreign jurisdictions as opportunities arise. We also offer various non-card consumer lending products, including automobile financing and installment loan products, through our subsidiaries both in the United States and elsewhere.       We use IBS to differentiate among customers based on credit risk, usage and other characteristics and to match customer characteristics with appropriate product offerings. IBS involves developing sophisticated models, information systems, well-trained personnel and a flexible culture to create credit card or other products and services that address the demands of changing consumer and competitive markets. By actively testing a wide variety of product and service features, marketing channels and other aspects of offerings, we design customized solicitations that are targeted at various credit customer segments, thereby enhancing customer response levels and maximizing returns on investment within given underwriting parameters.       We build on information derived from our initial sources with continued integrated testing and model development to improve the quality, performance and profitability of our solicitation and account management initiatives. We apply IBS to all areas of our business, including solicitations, account management, credit line management, pricing strategies, usage stimulation, collections, recoveries, and account and balance retention.  ______________________ /1/ Signet Bank and Signet Banking Corporation were acquired by First Union National Bank and First Union Corporation, respectively, as of November 30, 1997.                                         1 Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol COF. Our principal executive office is located at 2980 Fairview Park Drive, Suite 1300, Falls Church, Virginia 22042-4525 (telephone number (703) 205-1000).  Business Description       Our business consists of both lending and non-lending activities. Our lending activities consist primarily of credit card products but also include other consumer lending activities, such as unsecured installment lending and automobile financing. Our non-lending business activities consist primarily of our retail deposit-taking business and various non-lending new business initiatives.  Lending Activities       We offer a wide variety of credit card products throughout the United States, and internationally primarily in the United Kingdom and Canada. Applying IBS, we customize our products to appeal to different consumer preferences and needs by combining different product features, including annual percentage rates, fees and credit limits, rewards programs and other special features. We constantly test new products to develop packages that appeal to different and changing consumer preferences. Our customized products include both products targeted at a range of consumer credit risk profiles, such as low rate cards and secured cards, as well as products aimed at special consumer interests, such as affinity, co-brand and student cards. Our pricing strategies are risk-based; lower risk customers may likely be offered products with more favorable pricing and we expect these products to yield lower delinquencies and credit losses. On products offered to many higher risk customers, however, we may experience higher delinquencies and losses, and we price these products accordingly. In general, however, IBS allows us to provide appropriate products to individual consumers with a wide range of credit histories.       Additionally, we have been applying our IBS to other financial and non- financial products and services. Our automobile finance subsidiary, Capital One Auto Finance, Inc./2/, a Texas corporation which we acquired in 1998 ("Capital One Auto Finance"), offers loans, secured by automobiles, through dealer networks throughout the United States/2/. Capital One Auto Finance is our platform to apply IBS to the automobile loan market, and as of December 31, 2000, loans outstanding at Capital One Auto Finance have tripled since its acquisition in 1998.       We have also expanded our existing operations outside of the United States, and are currently operating primarily in the United Kingdom and Canada, with additional operations in South Africa and France. We have experienced continuing growth in the number of accounts and loan balances in our international lending business, with most of our growth coming from our business in the United Kingdom. In 2000, to support the continued growth of our United Kingdom business and any future business in Europe, we established the UK Bank, which has authority to conduct full-service operations.        Our internet services provide significant support for our lending business and include account decisioning, real-time account numbering and account servicing. In the fourth quarter of 2000, we surpassed our previously stated goal of originating one million accounts and servicing two million accounts online by the end of 2000.  Non-Lending Activities       Our non-lending business consists primarily of our retail deposit-taking business, which is also supported in part by our internet services. In 2000, we launched CapitalOnePlace.com where we offer consumers a variety of products  ________________ /2/ Capital One Auto Finance, Inc. was formerly known as Summit Acceptance Corporation. We changed its name to Capital One Auto Finance, Inc. on November 7, 2000.                                         2 available for purchase online, some of which are offered in partnership with other companies. We also engage in various other non-lending new business initiatives, which we currently believe are not material to our operations or financial condition.  Geographic Diversity       Loan portfolio concentration within a specific geographic region or demographic portion of the population may be regarded as positive or negative based upon the current and expected credit characteristics and performance of the portfolio. Our consumer loan portfolio is geographically diverse. See Note O to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 62 of the Company's Annual Report to its stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2000 (the "Annual Report"), which is incorporated herein by reference.  Operations  Marketing       IBS is the cornerstone of our marketing strategy, and since its introduction in 1988 we have steadily increased our marketing efforts. We generate accounts primarily through direct mail and telemarketing solicitations, although we are increasing our efforts to solicit accounts through the internet, newspaper, magazine, partnership arrangements, radio and television advertising and location and event marketing. In 2000 we originated more than 1 million accounts and serviced more than 2 million accounts online. Many of our solicitations are targeted at potential customers that have been prescreened for creditworthiness. We track and periodically review the results of our various solicitation campaigns. In developing our targeting strategies, we respect the privacy of our customers (and potential customers) by using customer information only in accordance with our privacy policies and applicable laws.       We are also developing a brand marketing, or "brand awareness", strategy with the intent of differentiating ourselves from other credit card issuers and building a branded franchise to support our IBS and mass customization strategies.  Risk Management       We employ a comprehensive risk management process that integrates all aspects of an account's life cycle, from origination to closure. We have a credit policy group that makes marketing and credit policy decisions. This credit policy group consists of senior management representatives from the credit operations, risk management, marketing and analysis, and legal units. This group originates credit policy from the viewpoints of both profitability and credit risk, taking into consideration a multitude of factors, including prescreening criteria, proprietary model development and usage, as well as reviews of test programs and test results.       An important element of our risk management process is our use of IBS to identify and target potential consumers.  We attempt to continuously monitor and improve the effectiveness of our information systems and processes such that senior management possesses the tools to manage portfolio risk and respond to changing market conditions and challenges.  Credit Operations       Senior management actively manages our credit extension process which is designed to bring consistency in credit practices and operating efficiencies. Our scoring technology and verification procedures are highly automated with limited judgmental review. Our credit evaluation process is based on proprietary models using, among other things, credit scores developed by nationally recognized scoring firms which may be tailored to individual programs.                                         3 We validate, monitor and maintain these models as part of IBS. Our modeling also provides us with a tool to objectively measure our application stage credit policy decisions and account policies relating to credit lines, pricing and collections.       Our prescreened account solicitation process uses information from credit reporting agencies to identify consumers who are likely to be approved for a credit card account. We vary the underwriting criteria used to prescreen potential applicants from time to time in accordance with our established policies and procedures relating to the operation of our consumer revolving lending business. We may change such policies from time to time. In order to establish the amount of the customer's credit line, we analyze, and in some cases verify, the information on returned applications. We usually offer each customer whose credit request meets all of the applicable underwriting criteria a line of credit equal to or in excess of a minimum level we have established for each product offering. We also may review manually applications that are rejected by our credit scoring system because of inconsistencies in application information, inquiries from rejected applicants or for other reasons. Our credit analysts then have the ability to override decisions made by the system upon the receipt of additional information from an applicant or otherwise.       For non-pre-screened solicitations, we generate names of prospective customers from a variety of sources, including third party list vendors and our internal sources, and then edit the list using internal and external sources to ensure quality and accuracy. We approve or decline prospective customers who respond to a solicitation based on information from both their application and a credit report from one or more credit reporting agencies.  Account Management       We have found that active account management is necessary in order to respond to the changing economic environment and cardholder risk, usage and payment patterns. We calculate new credit scores for each account multiple times each year and new behavioral scores for open accounts each month. We use this information in account management strategies relating to credit lines, pricing, usage stimulation, retention and collection. For creditworthy and profitable accounts, such periodic review may result in more favorable pricing, higher credit lines, product upgrades or other enhancements which, based on testing, are likely to increase account usage or the overall profitability of an account. Conversely, for delinquent or other accounts with significant credit risk, periodic review may result in an account being reassigned to a higher risk category and hence not being eligible for credit line increases or, in certain circumstances, having pricing adjusted upward or the credit line reduced.       The IBS approach is also used to develop our retention strategies. We have developed integrated systems which evaluate account profitability and risk, test various strategies for cost and effectiveness in retaining cardholders and assist service representatives in negotiating potential pricing alternatives. Some of our products, including the introductory interest rate product and the balance transfer product, have a repricing feature after an initial period. We have developed methodologies for retaining these accounts and the balances in these accounts after the expiration of the introductory period.  Collection Procedures       We have used IBS to customize our collections strategies and determine the timing of collection activity based on models designed to predict delinquencies and charge-offs. We generally consider an account delinquent if we have not received a minimum payment by the accountholder's payment due date. We currently refer delinquent accounts for contact by phone between seven and 60 days after contractual delinquency, depending on the accountholder's risk profile. We design our policies and procedures to encourage accountholders to pay delinquent amounts; for example, once a delinquent account has re-established a payment pattern with three consecutive minimum monthly payments, it can be re-aged as current. Federal guidelines restrict how frequently an account can be re-aged, renewed or extended. We reserve the right to suspend charging privileges at any time after an account attains delinquent status. We may also, at our discretion, enter into arrangements with delinquent accountholders to extend or otherwise change payment schedules.                                         4 We charge-off as uncollectible an account (net of collateral, if any) at 180 days past-due, except with respect to certain installment loans and auto loans, which we charge-off as uncollectible at 120 days past-due. In connection with a secured credit card account, except as set forth below, we apply funds deposited as collateral to payment on the account shortly before the account is charged off as uncollectible. In connection with auto loans, for which we retain a security interest in the automobile which is the subject of the loan, we charge-off up to 40% of the value of the loan on the charge-off date, with additional amounts potentially charged off at a later date following our sale of the collateral and recovery of the proceeds from such sale. With respect to bankrupt customers, we charge-off the account within 30 days after we receive the bankruptcy petition and, with respect to secured credit card accounts, we apply funds deposited as collateral in satisfaction of the account only after the bankruptcy automatic stay is lifted. We charge-off accounts of deceased customers within 60 days of receiving proper notice if no estate exists against which a proof of claim can be filed, no other party remits payments, and no other responsible party is available. Transactions suspected of being fraudulent are charged off to non-interest expense after a 60-day investigation period. We may change our credit evaluation, servicing and charge-off policies and collection practices over time in accordance with our business judgment, applicable law and guidelines established by applicable regulatory authorities.  Technology/Systems       A key part of our strategic focus is the development of flexible, high- volume computer and operational systems capable of handling our growth and changes in marketing and account management strategies. Management believes that the continued development and integration of these systems is important to our efforts to reduce our operating costs and maintain a competitive advantage.       We have developed proprietary integrated information systems which allow our employees to manage the large volumes of data collected through the IBS process and to use such data in our account solicitations, application processing, account management and retention strategies. We use this information to predict consumer behavior and then match prospects to lending products with various terms and fees. These systems also allow our customer service representatives to access account specific information when responding to customer inquiries.  Funding       Our primary methods of funding include loan securitizations, issuing certificates of deposit, senior notes and other borrowings, and fed funds purchased from financial institutions. For a discussion of our funding program, see pages 25 and 34 of the Annual Report under the respective headings "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Managed Consumer Loan Portfolio" and "--Funding," which are incorporated herein by reference.  Competition       As a marketer of credit card products, we face intense competition in all aspects of our business from numerous bank and non-bank providers of financial services. Many of these companies are substantially larger and have more resources than we do. We compete with international, national, regional and local issuers of Visa and MasterCard credit cards. In addition, American Express, Discover Card, Diner's Club and, to a certain extent, smart cards and debit cards, represent additional competition in the general purpose credit card market. In general, customers are attracted to credit card issuers largely on the basis of price, credit limit and other product features and customer loyalty is often limited. We believe that IBS allows us to more effectively compete in both our current and new markets. There can be no assurance, however, that our ability to market services successfully or to obtain adequate yield on our loans will not be impacted by the nature of the competition that now exists or may later develop.       In addition, we face competition in seeking public funding from banks, savings banks, money market funds and a wide variety of other entities that                                         5 take deposits and/or sell debt securities, some of which are publicly traded. Many of these companies are substantially larger, have more capital and other resources and have better financial ratings than we do. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that competition from these other borrowers will not increase our cost of funds.  Employees       As of December 31, 2000, we employed 19,247 employees, to whom we refer as "associates." A central part of our philosophy is to attract and maintain a highly capable staff. We view current associate relations to be satisfactory. None of our associates is covered under a collective bargaining agreement.  Supervision and Regulation  General       The Bank is a banking corporation chartered under Virginia law and a member of the Federal Reserve System, the deposits of which are insured by the Bank Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"). In addition to regulatory requirements imposed as a result of the Bank's international operations (discussed below), the Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the Bureau of Financial Institutions of the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the "Bureau of Financial Institutions"), the Federal Reserve Board (the "Federal Reserve"), the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and the FDIC. The Bank is not a "bank" under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA"), because it (i) engages only in credit card operations, (ii) does not accept demand deposits or deposits that the depositor may withdraw by check or similar means for payment to third parties or others, (iii) does not accept any savings or time deposits of less than $100,000, other than as permitted as collateral for extensions of credit, (iv) maintains only one office that accepts deposits and (v) does not engage in the business of making commercial loans. Due to the Bank's status as a limited purpose credit card bank, our non-credit card operations must be conducted in our other operating subsidiaries.       The Savings Bank is a federal savings bank chartered by the Office of Thrift Supervision (the "OTS") and is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Its deposits are insured by the Savings Association Insurance Fund of the FDIC. The Savings Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the OTS and the FDIC.       The Corporation is not a bank holding company under the BHCA as a result of its ownership of the Bank because the Bank is not a "bank" as defined under the BHCA. If the Bank failed to meet the credit card bank exemption criteria described above, its status as an insured depository institution would make the Corporation subject to the provisions of the BHCA, including certain restrictions as to the types of business activities in which a bank holding company and its affiliates may engage. Becoming a bank holding company under the BHCA would affect the Corporation's ability to engage in certain non-banking businesses. In addition, for purposes of the BHCA, if the Bank failed to qualify for the credit card bank exemption, any entity that acquired direct or indirect control of the Bank and also engaged in activities not permitted for bank holding companies could be required either to discontinue the impermissible activities or to divest itself of control of the Bank.       As a result of the Corporation's ownership of the Savings Bank, the Corporation is a unitary savings and loan holding company subject to regulation by the OTS and the provisions of the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act. As a unitary savings and loan holding company, the Corporation generally is not restricted under existing laws as to the types of business activities in which it may engage so long as the Savings Bank continues to meet the qualified thrift lender test (the "QTL Test"). If the Corporation ceased to be a unitary savings and loan holding company as a result of its acquisition of an additional savings institution, as a result of the failure of the Savings Bank to meet the QTL Test, or as a result of a change in control of the Savings Bank, the types of activities that the Corporation and its non-savings association subsidiaries would be able to engage in would generally be limited to those eligible for bank holding companies.                                         6 Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (the "Act"), bank holding companies may engage in an expanded range of activities, including the securities and insurance businesses. To do so, a bank holding company may voluntarily elect to become a "financial holding company." While these changes are significant in their impact upon the traditional banking, securities and insurance industries, the impact upon us is less significant in light of the fact that we are regulated as a unitary thrift holding company and not as a bank holding company or a financial holding company. As a result, we may engage in both the full range of activities authorized for bank or financial holding companies, as well as additional non- banking activities typically impermissible for such entities. In addition, the Act permits a limited-purpose credit card bank such as the Bank to establish one or more foreign banking subsidiaries that are not subject to the business-line limitations credit card banks face domestically. Therefore, such foreign banking subsidiaries could engage in non-credit card lending and could accept retail deposits overseas.       While the Act does not impact the permissible range of our activities, it does impose some limitations on the future activities of unitary thrift holding companies. Existing unitary thrift holding companies such as the Corporation are "grandfathered" with full powers to continue and expand their current activities. Grandfathered unitary thrift holding companies, however, may not be acquired by nonfinancial companies and maintain their grandfathered powers. In addition, if a grandfathered unitary thrift holding company is acquired by a financial company without such grandfather rights, it may lose its ability to engage in certain non-banking activities otherwise ineligible for bank holding companies or financial holding companies.       The Corporation is also registered as a financial institution holding company under Virginia law and as such is subject to periodic examination by Virginia's Bureau of Financial Institutions.  Dividends and Transfers of Funds       Dividends to the Corporation from its direct and indirect subsidiaries represent a major source of funds for the Corporation to pay dividends on its stock, make payments on its debt securities and meet its other obligations. There are various federal and Virginia law limitations on the extent to which the Bank and the Savings Bank can finance or otherwise supply funds to the Corporation through dividends, loans or otherwise. These limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements, Federal Reserve, OTS and Virginia law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates and general federal and Virginia regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices. In general, federal banking laws prohibit an insured depository institution, such as the Bank and the Savings Bank, from making dividend distributions if such distributions are not paid out of available earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet applicable capital adequacy standards. In addition, the Savings Bank is required to give the OTS at least 30 days' advance notice of any proposed dividend. Under OTS regulations, other limitations apply to the Savings Bank's ability to pay dividends, the magnitude of which depends upon the extent to which the Savings Bank meets its regulatory capital requirements. In addition, under Virginia law, the Bureau of Financial Institutions may limit the payment of dividends by the Bank if the Bureau of Financial Institutions determines that such a limitation would be in the public interest and necessary for the Bank's safety and soundness.  Capital Adequacy       The Bank and the Savings Bank are currently subject to capital adequacy guidelines adopted by the Federal Reserve and the OTS, respectively. For a further discussion of the capital adequacy guidelines, see page 36 of the Annual Report under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Capital Adequacy" and Note J to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 58-59, which are incorporated herein by reference.       In January 2001, the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision issued for public comment a proposal to revise significantly the current international                                         7 capital adequacy accord. The purpose of the revisions is to ensure that banking organizations maintain prudent levels of capital, to make regulatory capital standards more reflective of banking risks, and to provide incentives for organizations to enhance their risk management capabilities. While many of these changes address the activities of internationally active banks, some elements of the proposal, including a revised basic or standardized risk-based capital framework, could affect all U.S. banking organizations. The proposal embodies a "three-pillars" approach for assessing a banking organization's capital adequacy. These pillars are: a more risk-sensitive minimum regulatory capital requirement; effective supervisory oversight; and strengthened market discipline through enhanced public disclosure. If ultimately adopted, this proposal may require some banks to increase their current capital levels.  FDICIA       Among other things, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") requires federal bank regulatory authorities to take "prompt corrective action" ("PCA") in respect of insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital ratio levels: well-capitalized, adequately-capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The capital categories are determined solely for the purposes of applying FDICIA's PCA provisions, as discussed below, and such capital categories may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of the Bank or the Savings Bank. As of December 31, 2000, each of the Bank and the Savings Bank met the requirements for a "well-capitalized" institution. A "well-capitalized" classification should not necessarily be viewed as describing the condition or future prospects of a depository institution, including the Bank and the Savings Bank.       Under FDICIA's PCA system, an insured depository institution in the "undercapitalized category" must submit a capital restoration plan guaranteed by its parent company. The liability of the parent company under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of 5.00% of the insured depository institution's assets at the time it became undercapitalized, or the amount needed to comply with the plan. An insured depository institution in the undercapitalized category also is subject to limitations in numerous areas including, but not limited to, asset growth, acquisitions, branching, new business lines, acceptance of brokered deposits and borrowings from the Federal Reserve. Progressively more burdensome restrictions are applied to insured depository institutions in the undercapitalized category that fail to submit or implement a capital plan and to insured depository institutions that are in the significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized categories. In addition, an insured depository institution's primary federal banking agency is authorized to downgrade the institution's capital category to the next lower category upon a determination that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or is engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice. An unsafe or unsound practice can include receipt by the institution of a less than satisfactory rating on its most recent examination with respect to its capital, asset quality, management, earnings or liquidity.       "Critically undercapitalized" insured depository institutions (which are defined to include institutions that still have a positive net worth) may not, beginning 60 days after becoming critically undercapitalized, make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt (subject to certain limited exceptions). Thus, in the event an institution became critically undercapitalized, it would generally be prohibited from making payments on its subordinated debt securities. In addition, critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator.       FDICIA also requires the FDIC to implement a system of risk-based premiums for deposit insurance pursuant to which the premiums paid by a depository institution will be based on the probability that the FDIC will incur a loss in respect of such institution. The FDIC has since adopted a system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a matrix that takes into account an institution's capital level and supervisory rating.       The Bank and the Savings Bank may accept brokered deposits as part of their funding. Under FDICIA, only "well-capitalized" and "adequately-capitalized" institutions may accept brokered deposits. Adequately-capitalized institutions, however, must first obtain a waiver from the FDIC before accepting brokered deposits, and such deposits may not pay rates that significantly exceed the                                         8 rates paid on deposits of similar maturity from the institution's normal market area or the national rate on deposits of comparable maturity, as determined by the FDIC, for deposits from outside the institution's normal market area.  Liability for Commonly-Controlled Institutions       Under the "cross-guarantee" provision of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 ("FIRREA"), insured depository institutions such as the Bank and the Savings Bank may be liable to the FDIC in respect of any loss or reasonably anticipated loss incurred by the FDIC resulting from the default of, or FDIC assistance to, any commonly controlled insured depository institution. The Bank and the Savings Bank are commonly controlled within the meaning of the FIRREA cross-guarantee provision.  Investment Limitation and Qualified Thrift Lender Test       Federally-chartered savings banks such as the Savings Bank are subject to certain investment limitations. For example, federal savings banks are not permitted to make consumer loans (i.e., certain open-end or closed-end loans for personal, family or household purposes, excluding credit card loans) in excess of 35% of the savings bank's assets. Federal savings banks are also required to meet the QTL Test, which generally requires a savings bank to maintain at least 65% "portfolio assets" (total assets less (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, (ii) intangibles, including goodwill and (iii) property used to conduct business) in certain "qualified thrift investments" (residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage backed and mortgage related investments, small business related securities, certain state and federal housing investments, education loans and credit card loans) on a monthly basis in nine out of every 12 months. Failure to qualify under the QTL Test could subject the Savings Bank to substantial restrictions on its activities, including the activity restrictions that apply generally to bank holding companies and their affiliates and potential loss of grandfathered rights under the Act. As of December 31, 2000, 78.22% of the Savings Bank's portfolio assets were held in qualified thrift investments, and the Savings Bank was in compliance with the QTL Test.  Subprime Lending Guidelines       On January 31, 2001, the federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve and the OTS, issued "Expanded Guidance for Subprime Lending Programs" (the "Guidelines"). The Guidelines, while not constituting a formal regulation, provide guidance to the federal bank examiners regarding the adequacy of capital and loan loss reserves held by insured depository institutions engaged in subprime lending. The Guidelines adopt a broad definition of "subprime" loans which likely covers more than one-third of all consumers in the United States. Because our business strategy is to provide credit card products and other consumer loans to a wide range of consumers, a portion of our loan assets may be viewed by the examiners as "subprime". Thus, under the Guidelines, bank examiners could require the Bank or the Savings Bank to hold additional capital (up to one and one-half to three times the minimally required level of capital, as set forth in the Guidelines), or additional loan loss reserves, against such assets. As described above, at December 31, 2000 the Bank and the Savings Bank each met the requirements for a "well-capitalized" institution, and management believes that each institution is holding an appropriate amount of capital or loan loss reserves against higher risk assets. Management also believes we have general risk management practices in place that are appropriate in light of our business strategy. Significantly increased capital or loan loss reserve requirements, if imposed, however, could have a material impact on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements.  Regulation of Lending Activities       The activities of the Bank and the Savings Bank as consumer lenders also are subject to regulation under various federal laws, including the Truth-in- Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act,                                         9 the Community Reinvestment Act and the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act, as well as under various state laws. Regulators are authorized to impose penalties for violations of these statutes and, in certain cases, to order the Bank and the Savings Bank to pay restitution to injured borrowers. Borrowers may also bring actions for certain violations. Federal bankruptcy and state debtor relief and collection laws also affect the ability of the Bank and the Savings Bank to collect outstanding balances owed by borrowers who seek relief under these statutes.   OTS Holding Company Proposal       On October 27, 2000, the OTS issued a notice of proposed rulemaking which would require savings and loan holding companies to provide the agency with prior notice of any significant transactions or activities proposed to be conducted by the holding company or any of its non-thrift subsidiaries. Significant transactions or activities include mergers, acquisitions or significant debt issuances. Because the proposed rule contains a prior notice requirement, the OTS theoretically could exercise the ability to approve or disapprove of any proposed transaction, thus potentially delaying or preventing the Corporation from entering into or consummating a significant transaction in the future. In response to public comments the OTS received with respect to the proposed rule, the OTS recently stated its intention to significantly revise the proposal to address substantial concerns raised. As such, the proposed rule has not been formally adopted. The nature of any potential impact of this proposed rule, however, is uncertain and cannot be predicted.  Legislation       Legislation has been introduced requiring additional credit card disclosures and that could place additional restrictions on the practices of credit card issuers. Additional proposals have sought to change existing federal bankruptcy laws and to expand the privacy protections afforded to customers of financial institutions. It is unclear at this time whether and in what form any such legislation will be adopted or, if adopted, what its impact on the Bank, the Savings Bank or the Corporation would be. Congress may in the future consider other legislation that would materially affect the banking or credit card industries.  Privacy       The Act requires a financial institution to disclose its privacy policy to customers and consumers, and requires that such customers and consumers be given a choice (through an opt-out notice) to forbid the sharing of their nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third persons. We have a written privacy policy posted on our web site, which we will deliver to all of our customers by June 1, 2001, in compliance with the Act. Pursuant to that policy, we protect the security of information about our customers, educate our employees about the importance of protecting customer privacy, and allow our customers to remove their names from the solicitation lists we use and share with others. We require business partners with whom we share such information to abide by the redisclosure and reuse provisions of the Act. We have developed and are in the process of implementing programs to fulfill on the expressed requests of customers and consumers to opt out of information sharing subject to the Act. As our regulators establish further guidelines for addressing customer privacy issues, we may need to amend our privacy policy and adapt our internal procedures.       In addition to adopting federal requirements regarding privacy, the Act also permits individual states to enact stricter laws relating to the use of customer information. Many states are expected to consider such proposals which may impose additional requirements or restrictions on us.  Investment in the Corporation, the Bank and the Savings Bank       Certain acquisitions of capital stock may be subject to regulatory approval or notice under federal or Virginia law. Investors are responsible for insuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire shares of capital stock of                                        10 the Corporation in excess of the amount which can be acquired without regulatory approval.       The Bank and the Savings Bank are each "insured depository institutions" within the meaning of the Change in Bank Control Act. Consequently, federal law and regulations prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of the Company without, in most cases, prior written approval of the Federal Reserve or the OTS, as applicable. Control is conclusively presumed if, among other things, a person or company acquires more than 25% of any class of voting stock of the Corporation. A rebuttable presumption of control arises if a person or company acquires more than 10% of any class of voting stock and is subject to any of a number of specified "control factors" as set forth in the applicable regulations.       Although the Bank is not a "bank" within the meaning of Virginia's reciprocal interstate banking legislation (Chapter 15 of Title 6.1 of the Code of Virginia), it is a "bank" within the meaning of Chapter 13 of Title 6.1 of the Code of Virginia governing the acquisition of interests in Virginia financial institutions (the "Financial Institution Holding Company Act"). The Financial Institution Holding Company Act prohibits any person or entity from acquiring, or making any public offer to acquire, control of a Virginia financial institution or its holding company without making application to, and receiving prior approval from, the Bureau of Financial Institutions.  Interstate Taxation       Several states have passed legislation which attempts to tax the income from interstate financial activities, including credit cards, derived from accounts held by local state residents. Based on the volume of its business in these states and the nature of the legislation passed to date, we currently believe that this development will not materially affect our financial condition. The states may also consider legislation to tax income derived from transactions conducted through the Internet. We currently solicit accounts and take account information via the Internet. It is unclear at this time, however, whether and in what form any such legislation will be adopted or, if adopted, what its impact on us would be.  International Regulation       We also face regulation in certain foreign jurisdictions where we currently, and may in the future, operate. Those regulations may be similar to or substantially different from the regulatory requirements we face in the United States.       In the United Kingdom, we operate through the UK Bank, which was established in 2000. The UK Bank is regulated by the Financial Services Authority and the Office of Fair Trading (the "OFT"). The UK Bank is an "authorized deposit taker" under the Banking Act-1987 and thus is able to take consumer deposits in the UK. The UK Bank has also been granted full license by the OFT to issue consumer credit under the Consumer Credit Act-1974. The FSA requires the UK Bank to maintain certain capital ratios at all times. In addition, the UK Bank is limited by the UK Companies Act-1985 in its distribution of dividends to the Bank in that such dividends may only be paid out of the UK Bank's "distributable profits."       In Canada, we operate principally through a recently established branch of the Bank (the "Canadian Branch"). Under U.S. law, a foreign branch of the Bank may engage only in activities permissible for the Bank in the United States. Thus, the Canadian Branch is engaged solely in the issuance of credit cards. Our installment loan business in Canada is conducted through a separately incorporated finance company subsidiary of the Corporation.       The Canadian Branch is considered a federally regulated financial institution ("FRFI") under the Canadian Bank Act. FRFIs are authorized and supervised on an ongoing basis by the Canadian Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions ("OSFI"). The supervisory framework has been developed to allow OSFI to focus its efforts on evaluating an institution's material risks and the quality of its risk management practices. These goals are achieved through OSFI's evaluation of a FRFI's risk profile, financial condition, risk management processes and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Areas of review and evaluation include capital adequacy, large exposure limits, liquidity, loan loss provisioning, management and outsourcing.                                        11 In France, we operate through a branch of the UK Bank which was established under the European Union's passport authority. This branch issues credit cards and installment loans.  Risk Factors       This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. We also may make written or oral forward-looking statements in our periodic reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, in our annual report to shareholders, in our proxy statements, in our offering circulars and prospectuses, in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by our officers, directors or employees to third parties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include information relating to growth in earnings per share, return on equity, growth in managed loans outstanding and customer accounts, net interest margins, funding costs, operations costs and employment growth, marketing expense, delinquencies and charge-offs. Forward-looking statements also include statements using words such as "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "believe," "estimate" or similar expressions. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and projections, and therefore you should not place undue reliance on them.       Although we have tried to discuss key factors, please be aware that other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our financial performance.       Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including the risks discussed below. Our future performance and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Many of the factors that will determine these results and values are beyond our ability to control or predict. This section highlights specific risks that could affect us and our business.  We Face Intense Competition in all of our Markets       We face intense competition from many other providers of credit cards and other financial products and services. In particular, we compete with international, national, regional and local bank card issuers, with other general purpose credit or charge card issuers, and to a certain extent, issuers of smart cards and debit cards. In addition, the Act, which permits greater affiliations between banks, securities firms and insurance companies, may increase competition in the financial services industry, including in the credit card business. Increased competition has resulted in, and may continue to cause, a decrease in credit card response rates and reduced productivity of marketing dollars invested in certain lines of business. Other credit card companies may compete with us for customers by offering lower interest rates and fees. Because customers generally choose credit card issuers based on price (mostly interest rates and fees), credit limit and other product features, customer loyalty is limited. We may lose entire accounts, or may lose account balances, to competing card issuers.       In the past, we have faced intense competition primarily in the market for our low introductory rate credit cards. Recently, however, the competition with our other credit card products, such as our low fixed-rate cards, secured cards and other customized cards, has also become more intense. The cost to acquire new accounts varies along business lines and is expected to rise as we move beyond the domestic card market. We expect that competition will continue to grow more intense with respect to all of our products, including our products offered internationally.                                        12 Our Accounts and Loan Balances Will Fluctuate       Our accounts and loan balances and the rate at which they grow are affected by a number of factors, including how we allocate our marketing investment among different products and the rate at which customers transfer their accounts and loan balances to competing card issuers. Accounts and loan balances are also affected by general economic conditions, which may increase or decrease the amount of spending by customers, their ability to repay their loans, and other factors beyond our control.       Because we designed our IBS to take advantage of market opportunities, we cannot forecast how much we will spend for marketing, how we will spend such funds, or on which products. Likewise, our account and loan balance growth is affected by many factors, including the ones mentioned above. Our results, therefore, will vary as marketing investments, accounts and loan balances fluctuate.  It is Difficult to Sustain and Manage Growth       Our growth strategy is threefold. First, we seek to continue to grow our domestic credit card business. Second, we desire to grow our lending business internationally, in the United Kingdom, Canada and beyond. Third, we hope to identify and pursue new business opportunities, both financial and non- financial. Our management believes that, through IBS, we can achieve these objectives. However, there are a number of factors that can affect our ability to do so, including:       .  our ability to retain existing customers and to attract new customers;       .  the growth of existing and new account balances;       .  the delinquency and charge-off levels of accounts;       .  the availability of funding on favorable terms;       .  the amount of funds available for marketing to solicit new customers;       .  general economic and other factors;       .  the legal and regulatory environment;       .  a favorable interest rate environment;       .  our ability to build or acquire the necessary operational and         organizational infrastructure;       .  our ability to manage expenses as we expand; and       .  our ability to recruit experienced management and operations personnel.       Our expansion internationally is affected by additional factors, including limited access to information, differences in cultural attitudes toward credit, new regulatory and legislative environments and differences from the historical experience of portfolio performance in the United States and other countries.       Difficulties or delays in the development, production, testing and marketing of new products or services will affect the success of such products or services and can cause losses associated with the costs to develop unsuccessful products and services. Such difficulties could include:       .  failure to implement new product or service programs on time;       .  failure of customers to accept these products or services;                                        13 .  operational difficulties or delays;       .  losses arising from the testing of new products or services; and       .  legal and other difficulties.       In addition, any new products and services we offer may not achieve the same financial results as we have achieved in the past from our credit card business.  We May Experience Limited Availability of Financing and Variation in our Funding Costs       One of our major sources of funding is the securitization of consumer loans. Securitization transactions involve the sale of beneficial interests in consumer loan balances. Our ability to use securitization funding depends on how difficult and expensive such funding is. Until now, we have completed securitization transactions on terms that we believe are acceptable. However, securitization transactions can be affected by many factors. Economic, legal, regulatory, accounting and tax changes can make securitization funding more difficult, more expensive or unavailable on any terms both domestically and internationally, where the securitization of consumer loans may be on terms more or less favorable than in the United States. For example, securitizations that meet the criteria for sale treatment under generally accepted accounting principles may not always be an attractive source of funding for us, and we may have to seek other more expensive funding sources in the future.       In general, the amount, type and cost of our financing, including financing from other financial institutions, the capital markets and deposits, affects our financial results. A number of factors could make such financing more difficult, more expensive or unavailable including, but not limited to, changes within our organization, changes in the activities of our business partners, changes affecting our investments, interest rate fluctuations and regulatory changes. In addition, we compete for funding with other banks, savings banks and similar companies. Some of these institutions are publicly traded. Many of these institutions are substantially larger, have more capital and other resources and have better financial ratings than we do. Competition from these other borrowers may increase our cost of funds. Events that disrupt capital markets and other factors beyond our control could also make our funding sources more expensive or unavailable.  We May Experience Increased Delinquencies and Credit Losses       Like other consumer lenders, we face the risk that accounts will become uncollectible because accountholders may not repay their loans. Consumers who miss payments on their loans often fail to repay them, and consumers who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans. Therefore, the rate of missed payments, or "delinquencies," on our portfolio of loans, and the rate at which consumers may be expected to file for bankruptcy, can be used to predict the future rate at which we charge-off our consumer loans. A high charge-off rate would hurt our financial performance, the performance of our securitizations and our cost of funds.       Widespread increases in past-due payments and nonpayment are most likely to occur if the country or a regional area encounters an economic downturn, such as a recession, but they could also occur for other reasons. For example, fraud can cause losses. In addition, the age and rate of growth, or "seasoning," of a consumer loan portfolio also increases the rate of nonpayment and past-due payments. If we make fewer loans than we have in the past, the proportion of new loans in our portfolio will decrease and the delinquency rate and charge-off rate may increase. Therefore, the seasoning of accounts may require higher loan loss provisions and reserves. This would reduce our earnings unless offset by other changes.       In addition, we market many of our products to underserved markets, which may have less experience with credit risk and performance. These markets, in some cases, also have higher delinquency and charge-off rates. Although we believe that IBS can help us effectively price these products in relation to                                        14 their risk, we may not set high enough fees and rates for these accounts to offset the higher delinquency and loss rates we may experience.  We Face Risk From Economic Downturns and Social Factors       Delinquencies and credit losses in the credit card industry generally increase during periods of an economic downturn or recession. Likewise, consumer demand may decline during an economic downturn or recession. Accordingly, an economic downturn or recession (either local or national) can hurt our financial performance as accountholders default on their loans or carry lower balances. As we increasingly market our cards internationally, an economic downturn or recession outside the United States also could hurt our financial performance. A variety of social factors also may cause changes in credit card use, payment patterns and the rate of defaults by accountholders. Social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels, the public's perception of the use of credit cards and changing attitudes about incurring debt and the stigma of personal bankruptcy. We believe that we can manage these risks through our underwriting criteria and product design. Nevertheless, underwriting criteria and design may not be enough to protect our growth and profitability during a sustained period of economic downturn or recession or a material shift in social attitudes.  We Face Risk of Interest Rate Fluctuations       Like other financial institutions, we borrow money from institutions and depositors in order to lend money to customers. We earn interest on the consumer loans we make, and pay interest on the deposits and borrowings we use to fund those loans. The difference between these two interest rates affects the value of our assets and liabilities. If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our earnings could fall. Our earnings could also be hurt if the rates on our consumer loans fall more quickly than those on our borrowings.       We manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations through various financial instruments and techniques, such as asset/liability matching, interest rate swaps and similar financial instruments, hedging and other techniques. The goal is to maintain an interest rate neutral or "matched" position, where interest rates on loans and borrowings go up or down by the same amount and at the same time. We cannot, however, always achieve this position at a reasonable cost. Furthermore, if these techniques become unavailable or impractical, our earnings could be hurt.       We also manage these risks partly by changing the interest rates we charge on our customer accounts. The success of repricing accounts to match an increase or decrease in our borrowing rates depends on the overall product mix of such accounts, the actual amount of accounts repriced, the rate at which we are originating new accounts and our ability to retain accounts (and the related loan balances) after repricing. For example, if we increase the interest rate we charge on our consumer loan accounts and the accountholders close their accounts as a result, we won't be able to match our increased borrowing costs as quickly if at all.  Regulation and Legislation Can Change       Federal and state laws and rules, as well as rules to which we are subject in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business, significantly limit the types of activities in which we engage. For example, federal and state consumer protection laws and rules limit the manner in which we may offer and extend credit. From time to time, the United States Congress and the states consider changing these laws and may enact new laws or amend existing laws to regulate further the consumer lending industry. Such new laws or rules could limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge, restrict our ability to collect on account balances, or materially affect us or the banking or credit card industries in some other manner. Additional federal and state consumer protection legislation also could seek to expand the privacy protections afforded to customers of financial institutions and restrict our ability to share customer information.       The laws governing bankruptcy and debtor relief, in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business, also could change, making it more                                        15 expensive or more difficult for us to collect from our customers. Congress currently is considering legislation that would change the existing federal bankruptcy laws. One intended purpose of this legislation is to increase the collectibility of unsecured debt, however it is not clear whether or in what form Congress may adopt this legislation and we cannot predict how this legislation may affect us.       In addition, banking regulators possess broad discretion to issue or revise regulations, or to issue guidance, which may significantly impact the Corporation, the Bank or the Savings Bank. As noted above, the OTS is currently considering a proposal to impose prior notice requirements on savings and loan holding companies. The banking agencies have also recently issued examiner guidelines governing subprime lending activities which may require financial institutions engaged in such lending to carry higher levels of capital and/or loan loss reserves. The Corporation cannot predict whether a proposed rule will ultimately be adopted, or if adopted, what form the final rule will take. Furthermore, the Corporation cannot predict whether and how any guidelines issued by the agencies will be applied to the Bank or the Savings Bank. As such, the Corporation cannot predict how any rule or guideline may affect the Corporation, the Bank or the Savings Bank.       In addition, the existing laws and rules, both in the U.S and in the foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct operations, are complex. If we fail to comply with them we might not be able to collect our loans in full, or we might be required to pay damages or penalties to our customers. For these reasons, new or changes in existing laws or rules could hurt our profits.  Our Expenses and Other Costs Will Fluctuate       Our expenses and other costs, such as human resources and marketing expenses, directly affect our earnings results. Many factors can influence the amount of our expenses, as well has how quickly they grow. As our business develops, changes or expands, additional expenses can arise from asset purchases, structural reorganization or a reevaluation of business strategies. Other factors that can affect expenses include legal and administrative cases and proceedings, which can be expensive to pursue or defend. In addition, accounting policies that change can significantly affect how we calculate expenses and earnings.
