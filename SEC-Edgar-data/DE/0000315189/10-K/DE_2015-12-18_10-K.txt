BUSINESS.
Products Deere& Company (the Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, John Deere) have operations that are categorized into three major business segments.
The agriculture and turf segment primarily manufactures and distributes a full line of agriculture and turf equipment and related service parts  including large, medium and utility tractors; loaders; combines, corn pickers, cotton and sugarcane harvesters and related front-end equipment and sugarcane loaders; tillage, seeding and application equipment, including sprayers, nutrient management and soil preparation machinery; hay and forage equipment, including self-propelled forage harvesters and attachments, balers and mowers; turf and utility equipment, including riding lawn equipment and walk-behind mowers, golf course equipment, utility vehicles, and commercial mowing equipment, along with a broad line of associated implements; integrated agricultural management systems technology and solutions; and other outdoor power products.
The construction and forestry segment primarily manufactures and distributes a broad range of machines and service parts used in construction, earthmoving, material handling and timber harvesting  including backhoe loaders; crawler dozers and loaders; four-wheel-drive loaders; excavators; motor graders; articulated dump trucks; landscape loaders; skid-steer loaders; and log skidders, feller bunchers, log loaders, log forwarders, log harvesters and related attachments.
The products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets.
The financial services segment primarily finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the financial services segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, finances retail revolving charge accounts and offers crop risk-mitigation products and extended equipment warranties.
John Deeres worldwide agriculture and turf operations and construction and forestry operations are sometimes collectively referred to as the equipment operations. The financial services segment is sometimes referred to as the financial services operations.
Additional information is presented in the discussion of business segment and geographic area results on page22. The John Deere enterprise has manufactured agricultural machinery since 1837. The present Company was incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1958.
The Companys internet address is http://www.JohnDeere.com . Through that address, the Companys annual report on Form10-K, quarterly reports on Form10-Q, current reports on Form8-K and amendments to those reports are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Securities and Exchange Commission or Commission). The information contained on the Companys website is not included in, or incorporated by reference into, this annual report on Form10-K.
Market Conditions and Outlook The Companys equipment sales are projected to decrease about 15 percent for fiscal year 2015 and decrease about 21 percent for the first quarter, compared with the same periods of 2014. For fiscal year 2015, net income attributable to Deere& Company is anticipated to be about $1.9 billion.
Agriculture& Turf.
The Companys worldwide sales of agriculture and turf equipment are forecast to decrease by about 20 percent for fiscal year 2015 as a result of weaker conditions in the global farm economy. Lower commodity prices and falling farm incomes are putting pressure on demand for agricultural machinery, especially for larger models. Conditions are more positive in the U.S. livestock sector, providing support to the sale of smaller sizes of equipment. Based on these factors, industry sales for agricultural machinery in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be down 25 to 30 percent for 2015.
Industry sales in the European Union (EU) 28 nations are forecast to decrease about 10 percent due to lower crop prices and farm incomes as well as potential pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to decrease about 10 percent as a result of the headwinds affecting agricultural producers. Industry sales in the Commonwealth of Independent States are expected to deteriorate further due in part to tight credit conditions. Asian sales are projected to decrease slightly, with most of the decline centered in China.
2 Table of Contents U.S. and Canada industry sales of turf and utility equipment are expected to be the same to up 5 percent for 2015, benefitting from general economic growth.
Construction& Forestry.
The Companys worldwide sales of construction and forestry equipment are forecast to increase by about 5 percent for 2015. The gain reflects further economic recovery and higher housing starts in the U.S. as well as sales increases outside the U.S. and Canada. Global forestry sales are expected to be about the same as the attractive levels of 2014.
Financial Services.
Fiscal-year 2015 net income attributable to Deere& Company for the financial services operations is expected to be approximately $610 million. The outlook reflects a decline from 2014 due primarily to an expected increase in the provision for credit losses, versus the low level of 2014, and a less favorable tax rate. These factors are projected to be partially offset by growth in the credit portfolio and higher crop insurance margins.
2014 Consolidated Results Compared with 2013 Worldwide net income attributable to Deere& Company in 2014 was $3,162 million, or $8.63 per share diluted ($8.71 basic), compared with $3,537 million, or $9.09 per share diluted ($9.18 basic), in 2013. Net sales and revenues decreased 5 percent to $36,067 million in 2014, compared with $37,795 million in 2013. Net sales of the equipment operations decreased 6 percent in 2014 to $32,961 million from $34,998 million last year. The sales decrease was largely due to lower shipment volumes and an unfavorable foreign currency translation effect of 1 percent, partially offset by price realization of 2 percent. Net sales in the U.S. and Canada decreased 8 percent in 2014. Net sales outside the U.S. and Canada decreased 3 percent in 2014, which included an unfavorable effect of 1 percent for foreign currency translation.
Worldwide equipment operations had an operating profit of $4,297 million in 2014, compared with $5,058 million in 2013. The operating profit decline was due primarily to the impact of lower shipment and production volumes, a less favorable product mix, the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange and higher production costs primarily related to the impact of engine emission programs. The decline was partially offset by price realization. Last years results were also affected by impairment charges for the companys John Deere Landscapes and John Deere Water operations.
The equipment operations net income was $2,548 million in 2014, compared with $2,974 million in 2013. The same operating factors mentioned above affected these results.
Net income of the financial services operations attributable to Deere& Company in 2014 increased to $624 million, compared with $565 million in 2013. The improvement was due primarily to growth in the credit portfolio, a more favorable effective tax rate, partially offset by lower crop insurance margins, higher selling, administrative and general expenses and a higher provision for credit losses. Additional information is presented in the discussion of the Worldwide Financial Services Operations on page22.
The cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2014 was 75.2 percent, compared with 73.3 percent last year. The increase was due primarily to a less favorable product mix, the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange and higher production costs largely related to engine emission requirements, partially offset by price realization.
Additional information on 2014 results is presented on pages21-23.
EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS Agriculture and Turf The John Deere agriculture and turf segment manufactures and distributes a full line of agriculture and turf equipment and related service parts. The segments global operating model is designed to enable faster geographic growth and increase the segments competitiveness. Under this model, the segment consolidates all markets into four geographical customer focus areas to facilitate deep customer understanding and deliver better customer service. The segments equipment operations are consolidated into five product platforms  crop harvesting (combines, corn pickers, cotton and sugarcane harvesters and related front-end equipment and sugarcane loaders); turf and utility (utility vehicles, riding lawn equipment, walk-behind mowers, commercial mowing equipment, golf course equipment, implements for mowing, tilling, snow and debris handling, aerating and many other residential, commercial, golf and sports turf care applications and other outdoor power products); hay and forage (self-propelled forage harvesters and attachments, balers and mowers); crop care (tillage, seeding and application equipment, including sprayers, nutrient management and soil preparation machinery); and tractors (loaders and large, medium and utility tractors and related attachments). John Deere also purchases certain products from other manufacturers for resale.
3 Table of Contents The segment also provides integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems. John Deere has developed a comprehensive agricultural management systems approach using advanced communications, data collection and global satellite positioning technologies to enable farmers to better control input costs and yields, improve soil conservation, minimize chemical use, and to gather information. John Deeres advanced telematics systems remotely connect agricultural equipment owners, business managers and dealers to agricultural equipment in the field, providing real-time alerts and information about equipment location, utilization, performance and maintenance to improve productivity and efficiency.
In addition to the John Deere brand, the agriculture and turf segment purchases and sells a variety of equipment attachments under the Frontier, Kemper and Green Systems brand names, and manufactures and sells walk-behind mowers and scarifiers in select European countries under the SABO brand name. John Deere manufactures its agriculture and turf equipment for sale primarily through independent retail dealer networks, and also builds products for sale by mass retailers, including The Home Depot and Lowes.
Sales of agricultural equipment are affected by total farm cash receipts, which reflect levels of farm commodity prices, acreage planted, crop yields and government policies, including the amount and timing of government payments. Sales are also influenced by general economic conditions, farm land prices, farmers debt levels and access to financing, interest and exchange rates, agricultural trends, including the production of and demand for renewable fuels, labor availability and costs, energy costs and other input costs associated with farming. Other important factors affecting new agricultural equipment sales are the value and level of used equipment, including tractors, harvesting equipment, self-propelled sprayers, hay and forage equipment and seeding equipment. Weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of agricultural equipment purchasers.
Innovations in machinery and technology also influence agricultural equipment purchasing. For example, larger, more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations. Large, cost-efficient, highly-mechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output. The large-size agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to John Deere. A large proportion of the equipment operations total agricultural equipment sales in the U.S. and Canada, and a growing proportion of sales in many countries outside the U.S. and Canada, comprises tractors over 100 horsepower, self-propelled combines, self-propelled cotton pickers, self-propelled forage harvesters, self-propelled sprayers and seeding equipment. However, as John Deere expands its business globally, especially in developing countries where demand for smaller equipment is greater, John Deeres sales of small tractors below 100 horsepower are increasing, and John Deere offers a number of harvesting solutions to support development of the mechanized harvesting of grain, oilseeds, cotton, sugar and biomass.
Retail sales of lawn and garden tractors, compact utility tractors, residential and commercial mowers, utility vehicles, and golf and turf equipment are influenced by weather conditions, consumer spending patterns and general economic conditions.
Seasonality . Seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during the year. Seasonal demand must be estimated in advance, and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year. For certain equipment, John Deere offers early order discounts to retail customers. Production schedules are based, in part, on these early order programs. The segment incurs substantial seasonal variation in cash flows to finance production and inventory of agricultural equipment. The segment also incurs costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand. New combine and cotton harvesting equipment has been sold under early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to customers who take delivery of machines during off-season periods. In Australia, Canada and the U.S., there are typically several used equipment trade-in transactions as part of most new agricultural equipment sales. To provide support to its dealers for these used equipment trade-ins, John Deere provides dealers in these countries with a pool of funds, awarded to dealers as a percentage of the dealer cost for eligible new equipment sales. Dealers can use these funds to defray the costs of carrying or marketing used equipment inventory or to provide financing incentives to customers purchasing the used equipment.
Retail demand for turf and utility equipment is normally higher in the second and third fiscal quarters. John Deere has pursued a strategy of building and shipping such equipment as close to retail demand as possible. Consequently, to increase asset turnover and reduce the average level of field inventories through the year, production and shipment schedules of these product lines are normally proportionately higher in the second and third fiscal quarters of each year, corresponding closely to the seasonal pattern of retail sales.
4 Table of Contents Construction and Forestry John Deeres construction and forestry equipment includes a broad range of backhoe loaders, crawler dozers and loaders, four-wheel-drive loaders, excavators, motor graders, articulated dump trucks, landscape loaders, skid-steer loaders, log skidders, log feller bunchers, log loaders, log forwarders, log harvesters and a variety of attachments. John Deere provides a broad line of construction equipment and the most complete line of forestry machines and attachments available in the world. The construction and forestry machines are distributed under the John Deere brand name, and forestry attachments are distributed under the John Deere and Waratah brand names. In addition to the equipment manufactured by the construction and forestry segment, John Deere purchases certain products from other manufacturers for resale. The segment also provides comprehensive fleet management telematics solutions designed to improve customer productivity and efficiency through access to fleet location, utilization and maintenance information.
The prevailing levels of residential, commercial and public construction and the condition of the forestry products industry influence retail sales of John Deere construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry equipment. General economic conditions, the level of interest rates, the availability of credit and certain commodity prices such as those applicable to pulp, paper and saw logs also influence sales.
Pursuant to agreements between John Deere and Bell Equipment Limited (Bell), Belllicenses John Deere to manufacture articulated dump trucksin the U.S. for John Deeres distribution under the John Deere brand name inNorth, Central and South America. John Deere licenses Bell to manufacture and sell certain John Deere-designed construction equipment in specified territories of Africa.Bell is also the distributor of certain John Deere-manufactured construction equipment under the Bellbrand and forestry equipment under the John Deerebrand in certain territories of Africa. Bell and John Deere have agreed to terminate the articulated dump truck manufacturing and license agreements over the next few years.
John Deere and Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. (Hitachi) have a joint venture for the manufacture of hydraulic excavators and tracked forestry equipment and loaders in the U.S. and Canada and a joint venture for the manufacture of excavators in Brazil. John Deere distributes Hitachi brands of construction and mining equipment in North, Central and South America. John Deere also has supply agreements with Hitachi under which a range of construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry equipment manufactured by John Deere in the U.S., Finland and New Zealand is distributed by Hitachi in certain Asian markets.
In India, the construction and forestry division manufactures construction equipment branded Leyland Deere through its joint venture with Ashok Leyland Limited, known as Ashok Leyland John Deere Construction Equipment Company Private Limited (ALJD).The division has also established manufacturing capacity for construction equipment in China and Brazil.
The segment has a number of initiatives in the rent-to-rent, or short-term rental, market for construction, earthmoving and material handling equipment. These include specially designed rental programs for John Deere dealers and expanded cooperation with major, national equipment rental companies.
John Deere also owns Nortrax,Inc. that in turn owns Nortrax Canada Inc. that in turn owns Nortrax Quebec Inc. (collectively called Nortrax). Nortrax is an authorized John Deere dealer for construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry equipment in a variety of markets in the U.S. and Canada. John Deere also owns retail forestry sales operations in Australia, Brazil, Finland,Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
Competition The equipment operations sell products and services into a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets. The principal competitive factors in all markets include product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, customer service and price.In North America and many other parts of the world, John Deeres brand recognition is a competitive factor.
The competitive environment for the agriculture and turf segment includes some global competitors, including AGCO Corporation, CLAAS KGaA mbH, CNH Global N.V., Kubota Tractor Corporation and The Toro Company and many regional and local competitors.These competitors have varying numbers of product lines competing with the segments products and each has varying degrees of regional focus. An important part of the competition within the agricultural equipment industry during the past decade has come from a variety of short-line and specialty manufacturers, as well as indigenous regional competitors, with differing manufacturing and marketing methods. Because of industry conditions, including the merger of certain large integrated competitors and the emergence and expanding global capability of many competitors, particularly in emerging and high potential markets such as Brazil, China and India where John Deere seeks to increase market share, the agricultural equipment business continues to undergo significant change and is becoming even more competitive. John Deere has continued to increase its global manufacturing capacity to compete in these markets. The segments turf equipment is sold primarily in the highly competitive North American and Western European markets. The agriculture and turf segments global operating model is designed to enhance the segments competitive 5 Table of Contents position by reducing complexity, implementing standard processes and increasing customer focus, speed and flexibility while building on the segments broad global reach and deep understanding of the agriculture and turf care markets.
The construction and forestry segment operates in highly competitive North American and global markets and is seeking to grow its competitive position in other parts of the world, including Brazil, China,India and Russia. Global competitors of the construction and forestry segment include CaterpillarInc., Komatsu Ltd., Volvo Construction Equipment (part of Volvo Group AB), CNH Global N.V., Tigercat Industries Inc. and Ponsse Plc. The segment manufactures construction, earthmoving and material handling equipment for over 90 percent of the types of construction equipment used in the U.S. and Canada.
Engineering and Research John Deere invests heavily in engineering and research to improve the quality and performance of its products, to develop new products and to comply with government regulations. Such expenditures were $1,452 million, or 4.4 percent of net sales, in 2014, $1,477 million, or 4.2 percent of net sales, in 2013 and $1,434 million, or 4.3 percent of net sales, in 2012.
Manufacturing Manufacturing Plants . In the U.S. and Canada, the equipment operations own and operate 20 factory locations and lease and operate another three locations, which contain approximately 28.3 million square feet of floor space. Of these 23 factories, 14 are devoted primarily to agriculture and turf equipment, four to construction and forestry equipment, one to engines, two to engine and component remanufacturing and two to hydraulic and power train components. Outside the U.S. and Canada, the equipment operations own or lease and operate: agriculture and turf equipment factories in Brazil, China, France, Germany,India,Israel, Mexico, the Netherlands, Russia and Spain; construction equipment factories in Brazil and China; engine factories in Argentina, China, France,India and Mexico; and forestry equipment factories in Finland and New Zealand. These factories and manufacturing operations outside the U.S. and Canada contain approximately 19.5 million square feet of floor space. The engine factories referred to above manufacture non-road, heavy duty diesel engines, a majority of which are manufactured for John Deeres equipment operations. The remaining engines are sold to other regional and global original equipment manufacturers.
The equipment operations also have financial interests in other manufacturing organizations, which include agricultural equipment manufacturers in the U.S., Bell in South Africa, the Hitachi joint venture that builds hydraulic excavators and track log loaders in the U.S. and Canada and the Hitachi joint venture that builds hydraulic excavators in Brazil, the ALJD joint venture that builds backhoes in India and ventures that manufacture transaxles and transmissions used in certain agriculture and turf segment products.
John Deeres facilities are well maintained, in good operating condition and suitable for their present purposes. These facilities, together with both short-term and long-term planned capital expenditures, are expected to meet John Deeres manufacturing needs in the foreseeable future.
Existing capacity is adequate to satisfy John Deeres current expectations for retail market demand. The equipment operations manufacturing strategy involves the implementation of appropriate levels of technology and automation to allow manufacturing processes to remain profitable at varying production levels. Operations are also designed to be flexible enough to accommodate the product design changes required to meet market conditions and changing customer requirements. Common manufacturing facilities and techniques are employed in the production of components for agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment.
In order to utilize manufacturing facilities and technology more effectively, the equipment operations pursue continuous improvements in manufacturing processes. These include steps to streamline manufacturing processes and enhance responsiveness to customers. John Deere has implemented flexible assembly lines that can accommodate a wider product mix and deliver products in line with dealer and customer demand. Additionally, considerable effort is being directed to manufacturing cost reduction through process improvement, product design, advanced manufacturing technology, enhanced environmental management systems, supply management and logistics as well as compensation incentives related to productivity and organizational structure. In past years, John Deere has experienced volatility in the price of many raw materials. John Deere has responded to cost pressures by implementing the cost-reduction measures described above and by increasing prices. Significant cost increases, if they occur, could have an adverse effect on the Companys operating results. The equipment operations also pursue external sales of selected parts and components that can be manufactured and supplied to third parties on a competitive basis.
Capital Expenditures.
The equipment operations capital expenditures totaled $1,001 million in 2014, compared with $1,129 million in 2013 and $1,357 million in 2012. Provisions for depreciation applicable to these operations property and equipment during these years were $690 million, $630 million and $549 million, respectively. Capital expenditures for the equipment operations in 2015 are currently estimated to be approximately $875 million. The 2015 expenditures will relate primarily to the modernization and 6 Table of Contents restructuring of key manufacturing facilities, U.S. Tier 4 emission requirements, the construction of new manufacturing facilities and the development of new products. Future levels of capital expenditures will depend on business conditions.
Patents and Trademarks John Deere owns a significant number of patents, trade secrets, licenses and trademarks related to John Deere products and services, and expects the number to grow as John Deere continues to pursue technological innovations. John Deeres policy is to further its competitive position by filing patent applications in the U.S. and internationally to protect technology and improvements considered important to the business. John Deere believes that, in the aggregate, the rights under these patents and licenses are generally important to its operations and competitive position, but does not regard any of its businesses as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents. However, certain John Deere trademarks, which contribute to John Deeres identity and the recognition of its products and services, including but not limited to the John Deere mark, the leaping deer logo, the Nothing Runs Like a Deere slogan, the prefix JD associated with many products and green and yellow equipment colors, are an integral part of John Deeres business, and their loss could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Marketing In the U.S. and Canada, the equipment operations distribute equipment and service parts through the following facilities: two agriculture and turf equipment sales and administration offices located in Olathe, Kansas and Cary, North Carolina and one sales branch located in Grimsby, Ontario; and one construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry equipment sales and administration office located in Moline,Illinois. In addition, the equipment operations operate a centralized parts distribution warehouse in coordination with eight regional parts depots and distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada.
Through these U.S. and Canadian facilities, John Deere markets products to approximately 2,416 dealer locations, most of which are independently owned and operated. Of these, approximately 1,539 sell agricultural equipment, while approximately 426 sell construction, earthmoving, material handling and/or forestry equipment. Nortrax owns some of the 426 dealer locations. Turf equipment is sold at most John Deere agricultural equipment locations, a few construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry equipment locations and about 451 turf-only locations, many of which also sell dissimilar lines of non-John Deere products. In addition, certain lawn and garden product lines are sold through The Home Depot and Lowes.
Outside the U.S. and Canada, John Deere agriculture and turf equipment is sold to distributors and dealers for resale in over 100 countries. Sales and administrative offices are located in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany,India,Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Kingdom and an administrative office is located in Kenya. Associated companies doing business in China also sell agricultural equipment. Turf equipment sales outside the U.S. and Canada occur primarily in Europe and Australia. Construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry equipment is sold to distributors and dealers primarily by sales offices located in Australia, Brazil, Finland,Ireland, New Zealand, Russia and Singapore. Some of these dealers are independently owned while John Deere owns others. The equipment operations operate centralized parts distribution warehouses in Brazil, Germany and Russia in coordination with regional parts depots and distribution centers in Argentina, Australia, China,India, Mexico, South Africa, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
John Deere engines are marketed worldwide through select sales branches to large original equipment manufacturers and independently owned engine distributors.
Raw Materials John Deere purchases raw materials and some manufactured components and replacement parts for its equipment, engines and other products from leading suppliers both domestically and internationally. These materials and components include a variety of steel products, steel and iron castings, forgings, plastics, electronics and ready-to-assemble components made to certainspecifications. John Deere also purchases various goods and services used in production, logistics, offices and research and development processes. John Deere maintains strategic sourcing models to meet its production needs andbuild uponlong-term supplier relationships. John Deere uses a variety of agreements with suppliers intended to drive innovation, ensure availability and delivery of industry-leading quality raw materials and components, manage costs on a globally competitive basis, protect John Deeres intellectual property and minimize other supply-related risks. Supply chain risks monitored by John Deere to minimize the likelihood of the supply base causing business disruption include supplier financial viability, capacity, business continuity, quality and delivery and weather-related events including natural disasters. In fiscal year 2014, John Deere experienced no significant work stoppagesas a result of shortages of raw materials or other commodities.
7 Table of Contents Backlog Orders The dollar amount of backlog orders for the agriculture and turf segment believed to be firm was approximately $3.9 billion at October31, 2014, compared with $6.3 billion at October31, 2013. The agriculture and turf backlog is generally highest in the second and third quarters due to seasonal buying trends in these industries. John Deere generally produces and ships its construction and forestry equipment on average within approximately 60 days after an order is deemed to become firm. Therefore, no significant amount of construction and forestry backlog orders accumulates during any period.
Trade Accounts and Notes Receivable Trade accounts and notes receivable arise primarily from sales of goods to independent dealers. Most trade receivables originated by the equipment operations are purchased by the financial services operations. The equipment operations compensate the financial services operations at approximate market rates of interest for these receivables. Additional information appears in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
FINANCIAL SERVICES U.S. and Canada . The financial services segment primarily provides and administers financing for retail purchases from John Deere dealers of new equipment manufactured by John Deeres agriculture and turf and construction and forestry segments and used equipment taken in trade for this equipment.
The Company and John Deere Construction& Forestry Company (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) are referred to as the sales companies. John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation), a U.S. financial services subsidiary, generally purchases retail installment sales and loan contracts (retail notes) from the sales companies. These retail notes are acquired by the sales companies through John Deere retail dealers in the U.S. John Deere Financial Inc., a Canadian financial services subsidiary, purchases and finances retail notes acquired by John Deere Canada ULC, the Companys Canadian sales branch. The terms of retail notes and the basis on which the financial services operations acquire retail notes from the sales companies are governed by agreements with the sales companies. The financial services segment also finances and services revolving charge accounts, in most cases acquired from and offered through merchants in the agriculture and turf and construction and forestry markets (revolving charge accounts). Additionally, the financial services operations provide wholesale financing for inventories of John Deere agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment owned by dealers of those products (wholesale notes). The various financing options offered by the financial services operations are designed to enhance sales of John Deere products and generate financing income for the financial services operations. In the U.S., certain subsidiaries included in the financial services segment offer crop risk mitigation products and certain subsidiaries offer extended equipment warranties. The Company signed an agreement in December 2014 to sell the stock of the Crop Insurance operations (see Note 30).
Retail notes acquired by the sales companies are immediately sold to the financial services operations. The equipment operations are the financial services operations major source of business, but many retail purchasers of John Deere products finance their purchases outside the John Deere organization through a variety of sources, including commercial banks and finance and leasing companies.
The financial services operations offer retail leases to equipment users in the U.S. A small number of leases are executed with units of local government. Leases are usually written for periods of four months to sixty months, and typically contain an option permitting the customer to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term. Retail leases are also offered in a generally similar manner to customers in Canada through John Deere Financial Inc. and John Deere Canada ULC.
The financial services operations terms for financing equipment retail sales (other than smaller items financed with unsecured revolving charge accounts) generally provide for retention of a security interest in the equipment financed. The financial services operations guidelines for minimum down payments, which vary with the types of equipment and repayment provisions, are generally 10 percent to 30 percent. Finance charges are sometimes waived for specified periods or reduced on certain John Deere products sold or leased in advance of the season of use or in other sales promotions. The financial services operations generally receive compensation from the sales companies at approximate market interest rates for periods during which finance charges are waived or reduced on the retail notes or leases. The cost is accounted for as a deduction in arriving at net sales by the equipment operations.
The Company has an agreement with Capital Corporation to make payments to Capital Corporation such that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than 1.05 to 1 for any fiscal quarter. For 2014 and 2013, Capital Corporations ratios were 3.81 to 1 and 3.04 to 1, respectively, and never less than 3.32 to 1 and 2.75 to 1 for any fiscal quarter of 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company has also committed to continue to own, directly or through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of Capital Corporation and to maintain Capital Corporations consolidated tangible net worth at not less than $50 million. The Companys obligations to make payments to Capital Corporation under the agreement are independent of whether Capital 8 Table of Contents Corporation is in default on its indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Further, the Companys obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of Capital Corporations indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. The Companys obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of any specific indebtedness, obligation or liability of Capital Corporation and are enforceable only by or in the name of Capital Corporation. No payments were required under this agreement in 2014 or 2013.
Outside the U.S. and Canada . The financial services operations also offer financing, primarily for John Deere products, in Australia, Brazil, China,India, New Zealand, Russia, Thailand and in several other countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America. In certain areas, financing is offered through cooperation agreements or joint ventures. The manner in which the financial services operations offer financing in these countries is affected by a variety of country specific laws, regulations and customs, including those governing property rights and debtor obligations, that are subject to change and that may introduce greater risk to the financial services operations.
The financial services operations also offer to select customers and dealers credit enhanced international export financing for the purchase of John Deere products.
Additional information on the financial services operations appears on pages22, 23, 25 and 27.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS John Deere is subject to a wide variety of local, state and federal environmental laws and regulations in the U.S., as well as the environmental laws and regulations of other countries in which John Deere conducts business. John Deere strives to comply and believes it is in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations. However, failure to comply with these regulations could lead to fines and other penalties. John Deere is involved in the evaluation and clean-up of a limited number of sites but does not expect that these matters or other expenses or liabilities John Deere may incur in connection with any noncompliance with environmental laws or regulations or the cleanup of any additional properties, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows or competitive position of John Deere. With respect to acquired properties and businesses or properties and businesses acquired in the future, John Deere conducts due diligence into potential exposure to environmental liabilities, but cannot be certain that it has identified or will identify all adverse environmental conditions. Compliance with these laws and regulations has added, and will continue to add, to the cost of John Deeres products.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has issued increasingly stringent regulations concerning permissible emissions of off-road engines, and governmental agencies throughout the world are similarly enacting more stringent laws to reduce off-road engine emissions. John Deere has achieved and plans to continue to achieve compliance with these regulations through significant investments in the development of new engine technologies and after-treatment systems. Compliance with emissions regulations has added and will continue to add to the cost of John Deeres products.
EMPLOYEES At October31, 2014, John Deere had approximately 59,600 full-time employees, including approximately 29,000 employees in the U.S. and Canada. John Deere also retains consultants, independent contractors, and temporary and part-time workers. Unions are certified as bargaining agents for approximately 86 percent of John Deeres U.S. production and maintenance employees. Approximately 11,000 of John Deeres U.S. production and maintenance workers are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the United Auto Workers (UAW), with an expiration date of October1, 2015.
Unions also represent the majority of employees at John Deere manufacturing facilities outside the U.S.

RISK FACTORS.
The following risks are considered the most significant to John Deeres business based upon current knowledge, information and assumptions. This discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis beginning on page21, including the risks and uncertainties described in the Safe Harbor Statement on pages23 through 24, and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page36. These risk factors and other forward-looking statements that relate to future events, expectations, trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change, and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all of the Companys businesses. Although each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. The Company, except as required by law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factors discussion, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. The risks described in this Annual Report on Form10-K and the Safe Harbor Statement in this report are not the only risks faced by the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties may also materially affect the Companys business, financial condition or operating results. You should not consider these risk factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
International, national and regional trade laws, regulations and policies (particularly those related to or restricting global trade) and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair John Deeres profitability and growth prospects .
International, national and regional laws, regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of John Deeres products, services and technology, including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors, could harm John Deeres multinational business and subject John Deere to civil and criminal sanctions. John Deeres profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace. Restricted access to global markets impairs John Deeres ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world, and limits the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis. Trade restrictions could limit John Deeres ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair John Deeres ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products and services. These restrictions may affect John Deeres competitive position. Furthermore, the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to John Deeres agricultural and forestry customers. Policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world. John Deeres agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world. Furthermore, trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living, which could negatively impact John Deeres future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food, fuel and infrastructure. Additionally, changes in government farm programs and policies, including direct payment and other subsidies, can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the US and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales or transactions to specific persons, including financial institutions, or countries or based on product classification expose John Deere to potential criminal and civil sanctions. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws and sanctions, these laws and sanctions, particularly with respect to eastern Europe, are changing rapidly. Violations of these laws could have an adverse effect on John Deeres reputation, business and results of operations and financial condition.
Changes in government banking, monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on John Deere.
Policies of the U.S. and other governments regarding banking, monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity, stabilize financial markets and/or address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on John Deeres customers and markets. John Deeres operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform that could have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on John Deeres customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of John Deere products. Government policies on taxes and spending can also affect John Deere, especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development.
Changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bio-energy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain John Deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements.
Changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the worlds growing food and bio-energy demands, driven in part by government policies and a growing world population, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment. While higher commodity prices benefit John Deeres crop-producing agricultural equipment customers, higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers. Furthermore, changing bio-fuel demands may cause farmers to change the 11 Table of Contents types or quantities of the crops they raise, with corresponding changes in equipment demands. Finally, changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization could affect demand for John Deeres gasoline- or diesel-fueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards.
As John Deere seeks to expand its business globally, growth opportunities may be impacted by greater political, economic and social uncertainty and the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of John Deeres competition, customer base and product offerings.
John Deeres efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in additional geographic markets including but not limited to Brazil, China,India and Russia. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than John Deeres other markets. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes John Deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices, business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation, sanctions requirements and repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies. Expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the Companys financial results. As these emerging geographic markets become more important to John Deere, its competitors are also seeking to expand their production capacities and sales in these same markets. While John Deere maintains a positive corporate image and the John Deere brand is widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets, the brand is less well known in some emerging markets which could impede John Deeres efforts to successfully compete in these markets. Although John Deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances, John Deeres reputation and/or business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful.
John Deere operates in highly competitive markets.
John Deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets. John Deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. John Deere competes on the basis of product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, customer service and price. Aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or John Deeres failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect John Deeres business, results of operations and financial condition.
John Deere is subject to extensive anti-corruption laws and regulations.
John Deeres global operations must comply with all applicable laws, which may include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act or other anti-corruption laws. These anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws, violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have an adverse effect on John Deeres reputation, business and results of operations and financial condition.
Negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for John Deeres equipment and services, limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs.
The demand for John Deeres products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment, cautious consumer spending, lower corporate earnings, U.S. budget issues and lower business investment. Negative or uncertain economic conditions causing John Deeres customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing John Deeres equipment. Sustained negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment. John Deeres turf operations and its construction and forestry business are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions. Failure of increases in construction activity and housing starts to continue and be sustained could have a material adverse effect on John Deeres results of operations. If negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy, there could be a similar effect on John Deeres agricultural equipment sales. In addition, uncertain or negative outlook with respect to ongoing U.S. budget issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions. Such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce the Companys earnings and cash flows. Additionally, the Companys investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets, which would negatively affect earnings.
12 Table of Contents In addition, demand for John Deeres products and services can be significantly reduced by concerns regarding the diverse economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in the eurozone, the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, and the long term stability of the euro as a single common currency. Persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions within the individual countries in the eurozone, and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Companys euro- denominated assets and obligations, have an adverse effect on demand for John Deeres products and services in the eurozone and have an adverse effect on financial markets in Europe and globally. More specifically, it could affect the ability of John Deeres customers, suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses, to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for John Deeres products.
The Companys consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries, creating currency translation risk.
John Deere operates in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. John Deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which John Deere earns revenues. Additionally, the reporting currency for the Companys consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of John Deeres assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries currencies. Those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the Companys consolidated financial statements.
Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar could have a significant impact on John Deeres results.
Because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deeres sales worldwide, John Deeres operations and financial results could be impacted materially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry.
In recent years, negative economic conditions have frequently had an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates. The financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deeres sales worldwide. The financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations. The financial services segment may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The financial services segments inability to access funds at cost-effective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on John Deeres business. The financial services segments liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities. Additionally, negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels, resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact the financial services segments write-offs and provision for credit losses.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Act) and the regulations implementing the Act impose additional supervisory, financial and reporting requirements and compliance costs on John Deere and John Deeres financial services operations and could therefore adversely affect John Deere and its financial services segment.
The Act was enacted on July21, 2010 to broadly reform practices in the financial services industry, including equipment financing and securitizations. The Act directs federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and others, to adopt rulesto regulate depository institutions, non-bank financial institutions, thrift holding companies, the consumer finance industry and the capital markets, including certain commercial transactions such as derivatives contracts. Although the effects of the Act on the capital markets and the financial industry are not fully known until all the regulations have been finalized and implemented, the Act and its regulations impose additional reporting requirements, stress testing requirements, leverage, liquidity requirements, capital and other supervisory and financial standards and restrictions that increase regulatory-related compliance costs for John Deere and John Deeres financial services operations and could adversely affect John Deere and its financial services segments funding activities, liquidity, structure (including relationships with affiliates), operations and performance. Moreover, John Deeres operations, including those outside of the United States, will also be impacted by non-U.S. regulatory reforms, including Basel III, being implemented to further regulatenon-U.S. financial institutions and markets.
John Deeres business results depend largely on its ability to understand its customers specific preferences and requirements, and to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demand.
John Deeres ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality, at affordable prices, is critical to its success. This requires a thorough 13 Table of Contents understanding of John Deeres existing and potential customers on a global basis, particularly in potentially high-growth markets, including Brazil, China,India and Russia. Failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on John Deeres business.
John Deeres business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment.
Poor or unusual weather conditions, particularly during the planting and early growing season, can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of John Deeres customers, particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment. The timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production. Insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields. Excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times, and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth. Temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields, and may also affect disease incidence. Temperature affects the rate of growth, crop maturity and crop quality. Natural calamities such as regional floods, hurricanes or other storms, and droughts can have significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production. The resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment. In addition, poor or unusual weather conditions at critical periods in the planting, growing or harvesting seasons can impact the profitability of crop risk mitigation products. Sales of turf equipment, particularly during the important spring selling season, can be dramatically impacted by weather. Adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment. Drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes.
Changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials, components and whole goods could result in production disruptions or increased costs and lower profits on sales of John Deere products .
John Deere requires access to various raw materials, components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products. Changes in the availability and price of these raw materials, components and whole goods, which have fluctuated significantly in the past and are more likely to fluctuate during times of economic volatility, can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business, particularly if John Deere, due to pricing considerations or other factors, is unable to recover the increased costs from its customers. John Deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials, components and whole goods required to manufacture its products. Certain components and parts used in John Deeres products are available from a single supplier and cannot be re-sourced quickly. Supply chain disruptions due to supplier financial distress, capacity constraints, business continuity, quality, delivery or disruptions due to weather-related or natural disaster events could affect John Deeres operations and profitability.
John Deeres equipment operations and financial services segment are subject to interest rate risks. Changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment, adversely affect interest margins and limit the ability to access capital markets while increasing borrowing costs.
Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of John Deeres customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for John Deere equipment and customers ability to repay obligations to John Deere. In addition, credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to John Deeres financial services segment because such costs affect the segments ability to offer customers competitive financing rates. In addition, changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Companys net interest rate marginthe difference between the yield the Company earns on its assets and the interest rates the Company pays for funding, which could in turn affect the Companys net interest income and earnings. Actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks, can affect the availability and cost of funding for the Company and can increase the Companys cost of capital and hurt its competitive position.
John Deeres operations, suppliers and customers are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations of federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over John Deeres international operations.
In addition, private civil litigation on these subjects has increased, primarily in the U.S.
Enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental, health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and defense costs, and result in significant fines or penalties. In addition, new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict John Deeres operations, or those of our suppliers and customers, require significant expenditures to achieve compliance and/or give rise to civil or criminal liability. There can be no assurance that violations of such legislation and/or regulations, or private civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental, health or safety impacts of John Deeres operations, or those of our suppliers and customers, would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on John Deeres business, financial condition or results of operations.
14 Table of Contents Increasingly stringent engine emission standards could impact John Deeres ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment, which could negatively affect business results.
John Deeres equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction standards, including USEPA, Interim Tier 4/Stage IIIb and Final Tier 4/Stage IV non-road diesel emission requirements in the U.S. and European Union. These standards are applicable to many engines manufactured by John Deere and used in many models of John Deere agriculture and construction and forestry equipment. John Deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs and is introducing many new equipment models, largely due to the implementation of these more rigorous standards. While John Deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements and does not currently foresee significant obstacles that would prevent timely compliance, these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect John Deeres ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines, which could negatively impact business results.
Security breaches and other disruptions to John Deeres information technology infrastructure could interfere with John Deeres operations and could compromise John Deeres and its customers and suppliers information, exposing John Deere to liability that would cause John Deeres business and reputation to suffer.
In the ordinary course of business, John Deere relies upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of John Deere equipment and from customers of John Deeres financial services operations. John Deere uses information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, John Deere collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of John Deeres customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of John Deeres customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to John Deeres business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, John Deeres information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise John Deeres networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and damage John Deeres reputation, which could adversely affect John Deeres business.
John Deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and could be further impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities, suppliers and customers.
There is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of Earths atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. These considerations may lead to international, national, regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the future. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, including John Deere, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to John Deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances, facilities improvements and energy costs, which would increase John Deeres operating costs through higher utility, transportation and materials costs. Increased input costs, such as fuel and fertilizer, and compliance-related costs could also impact customer operations and demand for John Deere equipment. Because the impact of any future GHG legislative, regulatory or product standard requirements on John Deeres global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards, John Deere is unable to predict its potential impact at this time.
Furthermore, the potential physical impacts of climate change on John Deeres facilities, suppliers and customers and therefore on John Deeres operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions. These may include long-term changes in temperature levels and water availability. These potential physical effects may adversely impact the demand for John Deeres products and the cost, production, sales and financial performance of John Deeres operations.
Sustained increases in funding obligations under the Companys pension plans may impair the Companys liquidity or financial condition.
The Company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees, which impose on us funding obligations. The 15 Table of Contents Company uses many assumptions in calculating its future payment obligations under the plans. Significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns on pension investments being lower than expected. The Company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future. These factors could significantly increase the Companys payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.
The reallocation of radio frequency (RF) spectrums could disrupt or degrade the reliability of John Deeres high precision augmented Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, which could impair John Deeres ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers profitability.
John Deeres current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems, as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment, depend upon the use of RF signals. These signals include, but are not limited to, GPS signals, other GPS-like satellite signals, augmented GPS services and other RF equipment which link equipment, operations, owners, dealers and technicians. These radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national agencies. Any international or national reallocation of frequency bands, including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing, or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands, could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of John Deeres GPS-based products, which could negatively affect John Deeres ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions. For John Deeres agricultural customers, the inability to use high-precision augmented GPS signals or other RF signals could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance, seed, fertilizer, fuel and wage costs. For construction customers, disrupting GPS or RF applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs, as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies. These cost increases could significantly reduce customers profitability and demand for John Deere products.

The equipment operations own or lease nine facilities housing one centralized parts distribution center and eight regional parts depots and distribution centers throughout the U.S. and Canada. These facilities contain approximately 4.7 million square feet of floor space. Outside the U.S. and Canada, the equipment operations also own or lease and occupy buildings housing three centralized parts distribution centers in Brazil, Germany and Russia and regional parts depots and distribution centers in Argentina, Australia, China, India, Mexico, South Africa, Sweden and the United Kingdom. These facilities contain approximately 2.8 million square feet of floor space. John Deere also owns facilities for the manufacture and distribution of other brands of replacement parts containing approximately 1.4 million square feet. John Deere has projects underway currently to increase parts facilities floor space in India and Brazil.
The Companys administrative offices and research facilities, which are owned and leased by John Deere, contain about 3.7 million square feet of floor space globally and miscellaneous other facilities total 3.9 million square feet globally.
Overall, John Deere owns approximately 57.7 million square feet of facilities and leases approximately 14.2 million additional square feet in various locations.
ITEM 3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
John Deere is subject to various unresolved legal actions which arise in the normal course of its business, the most prevalent of which relate to product liability (including asbestos-related liability), retail credit, software licensing, patent, trademark and environmental matters. John Deere believes the reasonably possible range of losses for these unresolved legal actions in addition to the amounts accrued would not have a material effect on its financial statements.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules13a-15(e)and 15d-15(e)of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) were effective as of October31, 2014, based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by Rule13a-15(b)or 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act.
The company implemented a new system for the worldwide financial consolidation and reporting. The company began using this system to combine worldwide results for the fiscal year beginning on November 1, 2014. The new system is integrated with most of the companys general ledger systems, improves analytical capabilities and updates the system technology to a more sustainable environment. During fiscal year 2014, there were no other changes in the companys internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the companys internal control over financial reporting.
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of October31, 2014, using the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, management believes that, as of October31, 2014, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective.
The Companys independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. That report is included herein.

20 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2014, 2013 AND 2012 OVERVIEW Organization The companys equipment operations generate revenues and cash primarily from the sale of equipment to John Deere dealers and distributors. The equipment operations manufacture and distribute a full line of agricultural equipment; a variety of commercial and consumer equipment; and a broad range of equipment for construction and forestry. The companys financial services primarily provide credit services, which mainly finance sales and leases of equipment by John Deere dealers and trade receivables purchased from the equipment operations. In addition, financial services offer crop risk mitigation products and extended equipment warranties. The information in the following discussion is presented in a format that includes information grouped as consolidated, equipment operations and financial services. The company also views its operations as consisting of two geographic areas, the U.S. and Canada, and outside the U.S. and Canada. The companys operating segments consist of agriculture and turf, construction and forestry, and financial services.
Trends and Economic Conditions The companys agriculture and turf equipment sales decreased 9 percent in 2014 and are forecast to decrease by about 20 percent for 2015. Industry agricultural machinery sales in the U.S. and Canada for 2015 are forecast to decrease 25 to 30 percent, compared to 2014. Industry sales in the European Union (EU)28 nations are forecast to decrease about 10 percent in 2015, while South American industry sales are projected to decrease about 10 percent from 2014 levels. Industry sales in the Commonwealth of Independent States are expected to decrease. Asian sales are projected to decrease slightly in 2015. Industry sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be approximately the same to 5 percent higher. The companys construction and forestry sales increased 12 percent in 2014 and are forecast to increase by about 5 percent in 2015. Global forestry sales are expected to be approximately the same as the attractive levels of 2014. Net income of the companys financial services operations attributable to Deere& Company in 2015 is expected to be approximately $610 million.
Items of concern include the uncertainty of the effectiveness of governmental actions in respect to monetary and fiscal policies, the global economic recovery, the impact of sovereign and state debt, eurozone issues, capital market disruptions, trade agreements and geopolitical events. Significant volatility in the price of many commodities could also impact the companys results. Designing and producing products with engines that continue to meet high performance standards and increasingly stringent emissions regulations is one of the companys major priorities.
The company completed a year of solid performance and produced healthy levels of cash flow in spite of weaker conditions in the global farm sector. Even with a significant decline in sales and continued pullback in the global agriculture sector, the company expects to remain solidly profitable in 2015.
Longer term, the company believes it is well positioned to earn solid returns throughout the business cycle and realize substantial benefits from the worlds growing need for food, shelter and infrastructure.
2014 COMPARED WITH 2013 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Worldwide net income attributable to Deere& Company in 2014 was $3,162 million, or $8.63 per share diluted ($8.71 basic), compared with $3,537 million, or $9.09 per share diluted ($9.18 basic), in 2013. Net sales and revenues decreased 5 percent to $36,067 million in 2014, compared with $37,795 million in 2013. Net sales of the equipment operations decreased 6 percent in 2014 to $32,961 million from $34,998 million last year. The sales decrease was largely due to lower shipment volumes and an unfavorable foreign currency translation effect of 1 percent, partially offset by price realization of 2 percent. Net sales in the U.S. and Canada decreased 8 percent in 2014. Net sales outside the U.S. and Canada decreased 3 percent in 2014, which included an unfavorable effect of 1 percent for foreign currency translation.
Worldwide equipment operations had an operating profit of $4,297 million in 2014, compared with $5,058 million in 2013. The operating profit decline was due primarily to the impact of lower shipment and production volumes, a less favorable product mix, the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange and higher production costs primarily related to the impact of engine emission programs. The decline was partially offset by price realization. Last years results were also affected by impairment charges for the companys John Deere Landscapes and John Deere Water operations (see Notes 4 and 5).
The equipment operations net income was $2,548 million in 2014, compared with $2,974 million in 2013. The same operating factors mentioned above affected these results.
Net income of the financial services operations attributable to Deere& Company in 2014 increased to $624 million, compared with $565 million in 2013. The improvement was due primarily to growth in the credit portfolio, a more favorable effective tax rate, partially offset by lower crop insurance margins, higher selling, administrative and general expenses and a higher provision for credit losses. Additional information is presented in the following discussion of the Worldwide Financial Services Operations.
The cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2014 was 75.2 percent, compared with 73.3 percent last year. The increase was due primarily to a less favorable product mix, the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange and higher production costs largely related to engine emission requirements, partially offset by price realization.
Finance and interest income increased this year due to a larger average credit portfolio, partially offset by lower average financing rates. Other income increased due primarily to higher insurance premiums and service revenue. Research and development costs decreased primarily due to the completion of certain product developments in 2014 compared to last year. Selling, administrative and general expenses decreased due primarily to the deconsolidation of Landscapes and the sale of 21 Table of Contents the Water operations (see Note 4). Interest expense decreased due to lower average borrowing rates, partially offset by higher average borrowings. Other operating expenses increased due primarily to higher depreciation of equipment on operating leases, higher insurance claims and the write-down to realizable value and sale of the Water operations, partially offset by impairment charges in 2013 for the Landscapes operations (see Notes 4 and 5).
The company has several defined benefit pension plans and defined benefit health care and life insurance plans. The companys postretirement benefit costs for these plans in 2014 were $432 million, compared with $575 million in 2013. The long-term expected return on plan assets, which is reflected in these costs, was an expected gain of 7.5 percent in 2014 and 7.8 percent in 2013, or $848 million in 2014 and $862 million in 2013. The actual return was a gain of $1,213 million in 2014 and $1,470 million in 2013. In 2015, the expected return will be approximately 7.3 percent. The companys postretirement costs in 2015 are expected to increase approximately $85 million. The company makes any required contributions to the plan assets under applicable regulations and voluntary contributions from time to time based on the companys liquidity and ability to make tax-deductible contributions. Total company contributions to the plans were $138 million in 2014 and $338 million in 2013, which include direct benefit payments for unfunded plans. These contributions also included voluntary contributions to plan assets of $5 million in 2014 and $227 million in 2013. Total company contributions in 2015 are expected to be approximately $104 million, which are primarily direct benefit payments for unfunded plans. The company has no significant required contributions to pension plan assets in 2015 under applicable funding regulations. See the following discussion of Critical Accounting Policies for more information about postretirement benefit obligations.
BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS The following discussion relates to operating results by reportable segment and geographic area. Operating profit is income before certain external interest expense, certain foreign exchange gains or losses, income taxes and corporate expenses. However, operating profit of the financial services segment includes the effect of interest expense and foreign currency exchange gains or losses.
Worldwide Agriculture and Turf Operations The agriculture and turf segment had an operating profit of $3,649 million in 2014, compared with $4,680 million in 2013. Net sales decreased 9 percent this year due largely to lower shipment volumes, the previously announced sales of the companys Landscapes and Water operations and the unfavorable effects of currency translation. Partially offsetting these factors was price realization. The decrease in operating profit was driven mainly by lower shipment and production volumes, a less favorable product mix, the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange and higher production costs primarily related to engine emission programs. The decline was partially offset by price realization. As previously noted, last year also was affected by impairment charges for the Landscapes and Water operations (see Notes 4 and 5).
Worldwide Construction and Forestry Operations The construction and forestry segment had an operating profit of $648 million in 2014, compared with $378 million in 2013. Net sales increased 12 percent for the year mainly as a result of higher shipment volumes and price realization, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Operating profit benefited in 2014 from higher shipment volumes, lower selling, administrative and general expenses and price realization, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange.
Worldwide Financial Services Operations The operating profit of the financial services segment was $921 million in 2014, compared with $870 million in 2013. The results were higher due primarily to growth in the credit portfolio, partially offset by lower crop insurance margins, higher selling, administrative and general expenses and a higher provision for credit losses. Total revenues of the financial services operations, including intercompany revenues, increased 9 percent in 2014, primarily reflecting the larger portfolio. The average balance of receivables and leases financed was 13 percent higher in 2014, compared with 2013. Interest expense decreased 12 percent in 2014 as a result of lower average borrowing rates, partially offset by higher average borrowings. The financial services operations ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 3.37 to 1 in 2014, compared with 2.90 to 1 in 2013.
Equipment Operations in U.S. and Canada The equipment operations in the U.S. and Canada had an operating profit of $3,311 million in 2014, compared with $4,062 million in 2013. The decline was due primarily to the impact of lower shipment and production volumes, a less favorable product mix and higher production costs primarily related to engine emission programs. The decline was partially offset by price realization. Results in 2013 were also affected by impairment charges for the Landscapes and Water operations. Net sales decreased 8 percent due primarily to lower shipment volumes, partially offset by price realization. The physical volume of sales decreased 9 percent, compared with 2013.
Equipment Operations outside U.S. and Canada The equipment operations outside the U.S. and Canada had an operating profit of $986 million in 2014, compared with $996 million in 2013. The decrease was due primarily to the impact of lower shipment and production volumes, a less favorable product mix, the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange, higher production costs and an impairment charge for the China operations (see Note 5), partially offset by price realization. Results in 2013 were also affected by impairment charges for the Water operations. Net sales were 3 percent lower primarily reflecting decreased shipment volumes and the effect of foreign currency translation, partially offset by price realization. The physical volume of sales decreased 5 percent, compared with 2013.
MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK Company equipment sales are projected to decrease about 15 percent for fiscal year 2015 and decrease about 21 percent for the first quarter, compared with the same periods in 2014.
22 Table of Contents For fiscal year 2015, net income attributable to Deere& Company is anticipated to be about $1.9 billion.
Agriculture and Turf.
The companys worldwide sales of agriculture and turf equipment are forecast to decrease by about 20 percent for fiscal year 2015 as a result of weaker conditions in the global farm economy. Lower commodity prices and falling farm incomes are putting pressure on demand for agricultural machinery, especially for larger models. Conditions are more positive in the U.S. livestock sector, providing support to the sale of smaller sizes of equipment. Based on these factors, industry sales for agricultural machinery in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be down 25 to 30 percent for 2015. Fiscal year industry sales in the EU28 are forecast to decrease about 10 percent due to lower crop prices and farm incomes as well as potential pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to decrease about 10 percent as a result of the headwinds affecting agricultural producers. Industry sales in the Commonwealth of Independent States are expected to deteriorate further due in part to tight credit conditions. Asian sales are projected to decrease slightly, with most of the decline centered in China. Industry sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be about the same to 5 percent higher, benefiting from general economic growth.
Construction and Forestry.
The companys worldwide sales of construction and forestry equipment are forecast to increase by about 5 percent for 2015. The gain reflects further economic recovery and higher housing starts in the U.S. as well as sales increases outside the U.S. and Canada. Global forestry sales are expected to be about the same as the attractive levels of 2014.
Financial Services.
Fiscal year 2015 net income attributable to Deere& Company for the financial services operations is expected to be approximately $610 million. The outlook reflects a decline from 2014 due primarily to an expected increase in the provision for credit losses, versus the low level of 2014, and a less favorable tax rate. These factors are projected to be partially offset by growth in the credit portfolio and higher crop insurance margins.
SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Statements under Overview, Market Conditions and Outlook, and other forward-looking statements herein that relate to future events, expectations, trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change, and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all of the companys businesses.
The companys agricultural equipment business is subject to a number of uncertainties including the many interrelated factors that affect farmers confidence. These factors include worldwide economic conditions, demand for agricultural products, world grain stocks, weather conditions (including its effects on timely planting and harvesting), soil conditions (including low subsoil moisture), harvest yields, prices for commodities and livestock, crop and livestock production expenses, availability of transport for crops, the growth and sustainability of non-food uses for some crops (including ethanol and biodiesel production), real estate values, available acreage for farming, the land ownership policies of various governments, changes in government farm programs and policies (including those in Argentina, Brazil, China, the European Union,India, Russia and the U.S.), international reaction to such programs, changes in and effects of crop insurance programs, global trade agreements, animal diseases and their effects on poultry, beef and pork consumption and prices, crop pests and diseases, and the level of farm product exports (including concerns about genetically modified organisms).
Factors affecting the outlook for the companys turf and utility equipment include general economic conditions, consumer confidence, weather conditions, customer profitability, consumer borrowing patterns, consumer purchasing preferences, housing starts, infrastructure investment, spending by municipalities and golf courses, and consumable input costs.
General economic conditions, consumer spending patterns, real estate and housing prices, the number of housing starts and interest rates are especially important to sales of the companys construction and forestry equipment. The levels of public and non-residential construction also impact the results of the companys construction and forestry segment. Prices for pulp, paper, lumber and structural panels are important to sales of forestry equipment.
All of the companys businesses and its reported results are affected by general economic conditions in the global markets in which the company operates, especially material changes in economic activity in these markets; customer confidence in general economic conditions; foreign currency exchange rates and their volatility, especially fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar; interest rates; and inflation and deflation rates. Government spending and taxing could adversely affect the economy, employment, consumer and corporate spending, and company results.
Customer and company operations and results could be affected by changes in weather patterns (including the effects of drought conditions in parts of the U.S. and drier than normal conditions in certain other markets); the political and social stability of the global markets in which the company operates; the effects of, or response to, terrorism and security threats; wars and other conflicts and the threat thereof and the response thereto; and the spread of major epidemics.
Significant changes in market liquidity conditions and any failure to comply with financial covenants in credit agreements could impact access to funding and funding costs, which could reduce the companys earnings and cash flows. Financial market conditions could also negatively impact customer access to capital for purchases of the companys products and customer confidence and purchase decisions; borrowing and repayment practices; and the number and size of customer loan delinquencies and defaults. A debt crisis, in Europe or elsewhere, could negatively impact currencies, global financial markets, social and political stability, funding sources and costs, asset and obligation values, customers, suppliers, and company operations and results.
23 Table of Contents State debt crises also could negatively impact customers, suppliers, demand for equipment, and company operations and results. The companys investment management activities could be impaired by changes in the equity, bond and other financial markets, which would negatively affect earnings.
Additional factors that could materially affect the companys operations, access to capital, expenses and results include changes in and the impact of governmental trade, banking, monetary and fiscal policies, including financial regulatory reform and its effects on the consumer finance industry, derivatives, funding costs and other areas, and governmental programs, policies, tariffs and sanctions in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of certain industries or sectors (including protectionist, economic, punitive and expropriation policies and trade and licensing restrictions that could disrupt international commerce); actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and other central banks; actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other financial regulators; actions by environmental, health and safety regulatory agencies, including those related to engine emissions (in particular Interim Tier 4/Stage IIIb and Final Tier 4/Stage IV non-road diesel emission requirements in the U.S. and European Union), carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, noise and the effects of climate change; changes in labor regulations; changes to accounting standards; changes in tax rates, estimates, and regulations and company actions related thereto; compliance with U.S. and foreign laws when expanding to new markets and otherwise; and actions by other regulatory bodies including changes in laws and regulations affecting the sectors in which the company operates. Trade, financial and other sanctions imposed by the U.S., the European Union, Russia and other countries could negatively impact company assets, operations, sales, forecasts and results. Customer and company operations and results also could be affected by changes to GPS radio frequency bands or their permitted uses.
Other factors that could materially affect results include production, design and technological innovations and difficulties, including capacity and supply constraints and prices; the availability and prices of strategically sourced materials, components and whole goods; delays or disruptions in the companys supply chain or the loss of liquidity by suppliers; the failure of suppliers to comply with laws, regulations and company policy pertaining to employment, human rights, health, safety, the environment and other ethical business practices; events that damage the companys reputation or brand; start-up of new plants and new products; the success of new product initiatives and customer acceptance of new products; changes in customer product preferences and sales mix whether as a result of changes in equipment design to meet government regulations or for other reasons; gaps or limitations in rural broadband coverage, capacity and speed needed to support technology solutions; oil and energy prices and supplies; the availability and cost of freight; actions of competitors in the various industries in which the company competes, particularly price discounting; dealer practices especially as to levels of new and used field inventories; labor relations; acquisitions and divestitures of businesses; the integration of new businesses; the implementation of organizational changes; difficulties related to the conversion and implementation of enterprise resource planning systems that disrupt business, negatively impact supply or distribution relationships or create higher than expected costs; security breaches and other disruptions to the companys information technology infrastructure; and changes in company declared dividends and common stock issuances and repurchases.
Company results are also affected by changes in the level and funding of employee retirement benefits, changes in market values of investment assets, the level of interest and discount rates, and compensation, retirement and mortality rates which impact retirement benefit costs, and significant changes in health care costs including those which may result from governmental action.
The liquidity and ongoing profitability of John Deere Capital Corporation and other credit subsidiaries depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements, to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities, and to fund purchases of the companys products. If general economic conditions deteriorate or capital markets become volatile, funding could be unavailable or insufficient. Additionally, customer confidence levels may result in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact write-offs and provisions for credit losses. The failure of reinsurers of the companys insurance business also could materially affect results.
The companys outlook is based upon assumptions relating to the factors described above, which are sometimes based upon estimates and data prepared by government agencies. Such estimates and data are often revised. The company, except as required by law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise its outlook, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. Further information concerning the company and its businesses, including factors that potentially could materially affect the companys financial results, is included in the companys other filings with the SEC.
2013 COMPARED WITH 2012 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Worldwide net income attributable to Deere& Company in 2013 was $3,537 million, or $9.09 per share diluted ($9.18 basic), compared with $3,065 million, or $7.63 per share diluted ($7.72 basic), in 2012. Net sales and revenues increased 5 percent to $37,795 million in 2013, compared with $36,157 million in 2012. Net sales of the equipment operations increased 4 percent in 2013 to $34,998 million from $33,501 million in 2012. The sales increase included improved price realization of 3 percent and an unfavorable foreign currency translation effect of 1 percent. Net sales in the U.S. and Canada increased 5 percent in 2013. Net sales outside the U.S. and Canada increased by 4 percent in 2013, which included an unfavorable effect of 3 percent for foreign currency translation.
Worldwide equipment operations had an operating profit of $5,058 million in 2013, compared with $4,397 million 24 Table of Contents in 2012. The higher operating profit was due primarily to the impact of improved price realization and higher shipment volumes, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange, increased production costs, higher selling, administrative and general expenses and increased warranty costs. The increased production costs were due primarily to higher manufacturing overhead expenses in support of growth, new products and engine emission requirements, partially offset by lower raw material costs. The results were also affected by impairment charges for long-lived assets related to the Water operations and a write down to realizable value of the assets being held for sale for the Landscapes operations (see Notes 4 and 5).
The equipment operations net income was $2,974 million in 2013, compared with $2,616 million in 2012. The same operating factors mentioned above, as well as an increase in interest expense due to higher average borrowings and a higher effective tax rate affected these results.
Net income of the financial services operations attributable to Deere& Company in 2013 increased to $565 million, compared with $460 million in 2012. The results were higher primarily due to growth in the credit portfolio and higher crop insurance margins, partially offset by higher selling, administrative and general expenses. In addition, results in 2012 benefited from revenue related to wind energy credits. Additional information is presented in the following discussion of the Worldwide Financial Services Operations.
The cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2013 was 73.3 percent, compared with 74.6 percent in 2012. The improvement was primarily due to the increase in price realization, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange, higher production costs and increased warranty costs.
Finance and interest income increased in 2013 due to a larger average credit portfolio, partially offset by lower average financing rates. Research and development costs increased primarily as a result of increased spending in support of new products and more stringent engine emission requirements. Selling, administrative and general expenses increased primarily due to growth. Interest expense decreased due to lower average borrowing rates, partially offset by higher average borrowings. Other operating expenses increased primarily due to higher depreciation of equipment on operating leases and the impairment charge for the write-down to realizable value of assets being held for sale (see Note 5).
The company has several defined benefit pension plans and defined benefit health care and life insurance plans. The companys postretirement benefit costs for these plans in 2013 were $575 million, compared with $511 million in 2012. The long-term expected return on plan assets, which is reflected in these costs, was an expected gain of 7.8 percent in 2013 and 8.0 percent in 2012, or $862 million in 2013 and $887 million in 2012. The actual return was a gain of $1,470 million in 2013 and $849 million in 2012. Total company contributions to the plans were $338 million in 2013 and $478 million in 2012, which include direct benefit payments for unfunded plans. These contributions also included voluntary contributions to plan assets of $227 million in 2013.
BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS Worldwide Agriculture and Turf Operations The agriculture and turf segment had an operating profit of $4,680 million in 2013, compared with $3,921 million in 2012. Net sales increased 7 percent in 2013 primarily due to higher shipment volumes and improved price realization, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to improved price realization and higher shipment volumes, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange, increased production costs, higher selling, administrative and general expenses and increased warranty costs. The increased production costs were due primarily to higher manufacturing overhead expenses in support of growth, new products and engine emission requirements, partially offset by lower raw material costs. The results were also affected by the previously mentioned impairment charges for the Water and Landscapes operations.
Worldwide Construction and Forestry Operations The construction and forestry segment had an operating profit of $378 million in 2013, compared with $476 million in 2012. Net sales decreased 8 percent in 2013 primarily due to lower shipment volumes, partially offset by price realization. The decline in operating profit in 2013 was primarily due to lower shipment volumes, an unfavorable product mix, increases in production costs and higher selling, administrative and general expenses, partially offset by improved price realization.
Worldwide Financial Services Operations The operating profit of the financial services segment was $870 million in 2013, compared with $712 million in 2012. The results were higher primarily due to growth in the credit portfolio and higher crop insurance margins, partially offset by increased selling, administrative and general expenses. In addition, results in 2012 benefited from revenue related to wind energy credits. Total revenues of the financial services operations, including intercompany revenues, increased 5 percent in 2013, primarily reflecting the larger portfolio. The average balance of receivables and leases financed was 16 percent higher in 2013, compared with 2012. Interest expense decreased 18 percent in 2013 as a result of lower average borrowing rates, partially offset by higher average borrowings. The financial services operations ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 2.90 to 1 in 2013, compared with 2.25 to 1 in 2012.
Equipment Operations in U.S. and Canada The equipment operations in the U.S. and Canada had an operating profit of $4,062 million in 2013, compared with $3,836 million in 2012. The increase was due primarily to improved price realization and higher shipment volumes, partially offset by higher production costs, increased warranty costs and higher selling, administrative and general expenses. The results were also affected by impairment charges for the Landscapes and Water operations. Net sales increased 5 percent due primarily to price realization and higher shipment volumes. The physical volume of sales increased 1 percent, compared with 2012.
25 Table of Contents Equipment Operations outside U.S. and Canada The equipment operations outside the U.S. and Canada had an operating profit of $996 million in 2013, compared with $561 million in 2012. The increase was due primarily to the effects of improved price realization and higher shipment volumes, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange, higher selling, administrative and general expenses, increased production costs and higher warranty costs. The results were also affected by impairment charges for the Water operations. Net sales were 4 percent higher primarily reflecting price realization and increased shipment volumes, partially offset by the effect of foreign currency translation. The physical volume of sales increased 3 percent, compared with 2012.
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY The discussion of capital resources and liquidity has been organized to review separately, where appropriate, the companys consolidated totals, equipment operations and financial services operations.
CONSOLIDATED Positive cash flows from consolidated operating activities in 2014 were $3,526 million. This resulted primarily from net income adjusted for non-cash provisions, a change in accrued income taxes payable/receivable and a change in the retirement benefits, which were partially offset by increases in receivables related to sales, inventories and insurance receivables. Cash outflows from investing activities were $2,881 million in 2014, due primarily to the cost of receivables (excluding receivables related to sales) and cost of equipment on operating leases exceeding the collections of receivables and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by $2,441 million, purchases of property and equipment of $1,048 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales exceeding purchases of marketable securities by $408 million. Cash outflows from financing activities were $288 million in 2014 due primarily to repurchases of common stock of $2,731 million and dividends paid of $786 million, partially offset by an increase in borrowings of $3,112 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased $283 million during 2014.
Over the last three years, operating activities have provided an aggregate of $7,948 million in cash. In addition, increases in borrowings were $11,778 million, proceeds from sales of businesses were $398 million and proceeds from issuance of common stock (resulting from the exercise of stock options) were $385 million. The aggregate amount of these cash flows was used mainly to acquire receivables (excluding receivables related to sales) and equipment on operating leases that exceeded collections of receivables and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by $7,721 million, repurchase common stock of $5,850 million, purchase property and equipment of $3,526 million, pay dividends of $2,237 million and purchase marketable securities that exceeded proceeds from maturities and sales by $456 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased $140 million over the three-year period.
The company has access to most global markets at reasonable costs and expects to have sufficient sources of global funding and liquidity to meet its funding needs. The companys exposures to receivables from customers in European countries experiencing economic strains are not significant. Sources of liquidity for the company include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, funds from operations, the issuance of commercial paper and term debt, the securitization of retail notes (both public and private markets) and committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit. The companys commercial paper outstanding at October31, 2014 and 2013 was $2,633 million and $3,162 million, respectively, while the total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities position was $5,002 million and $5,129 million, respectively. The amount of the total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries, in which earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested, was $1,025 million and $559 million at October31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
Lines of Credit.
The company also has access to bank lines of credit with various banks throughout the world. Worldwide lines of credit totaled $6,413 million at October31, 2014, $3,367 million of which were unused. For the purpose of computing unused credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings, excluding secured borrowings and the current portion of long-term borrowings, were primarily considered to constitute utilization. Included in the total credit lines at October31, 2014 were long-term credit facility agreements of $2,500 million, expiring in April2018, and $2,500 million, expiring in April2019. These credit agreements require John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation) to maintain its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter and the ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to capital base (total subordinated debt and stockholders equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than 11 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. The credit agreements also require the equipment operations to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capital (total debt and stockholders equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) of 65 percent or less at the end of each fiscal quarter. Under this provision, the companys excess equity capacity and retained earnings balance free of restriction at October31, 2014 was $10,115 million. Alternatively under this provision, the equipment operations had the capacity to incur additional debt of $18,785 million at October31, 2014. All of these requirements of the credit agreements have been met during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.
Debt Ratings.
To access public debt capital markets, the company relies on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to the companys securities as an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors. A security rating is not a recommendation by the rating agency to buy, sell or hold company securities. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw company ratings based on its assessment of the companys current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Each agencys rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs, including costs of derivative transactions, and reduced access to debt 26 Table of Contents capital markets. The senior long-term and short-term debt ratings and outlook currently assigned to unsecured company securities by the rating agencies engaged by the company are as follows: Senior Long-Term Short-Term Outlook Moodys Investors Service,Inc.
A2 Prime-1 Stable Standard& Poors A A-1 Stable Trade accounts and notes receivable primarily arise from sales of goods to independent dealers. Trade receivables decreased by $481 million in 2014 due primarily to lower agriculture and turf shipment volumes, and the sale of the Water operations (see Note 4). The ratio of trade accounts and notes receivable at October31 to fiscal year net sales was 10 percent in 2014 and 11 percent in 2013. Total worldwide agriculture and turf receivables decreased $495 million and construction and forestry receivables increased $14 million. The collection period for trade receivables averages less than 12 months. The percentage of trade receivables outstanding for a period exceeding 12 months was 1 percent at both October31, 2014 and 2013.
Deere& Companys stockholders equity was $9,063 million at October31, 2014, compared with $10,266 million at October31, 2013. The decrease of $1,203 million resulted from an increase in treasury stock of $2,623 million, dividends declared of $803 million, a change in the retirement benefits adjustment of $684 million and a change in the cumulative translation adjustment of $416 million, which were partially offset by net income attributable to Deere& Company of $3,162 million and an increase in common stock of $151 million.
EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS The companys equipment businesses are capital intensive and are subject to seasonal variations in financing requirements for inventories and certain receivables from dealers. The equipment operations sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to financial services. To the extent necessary, funds provided from operations are supplemented by external financing sources.
Cash provided by operating activities of the equipment operations during 2014, including intercompany cash flows, was $4,532 million due primarily to net income adjusted for non-cash provisions, a decrease in inventories and trade receivables, a change in accrued income taxes payable/receivable and a change in the retirement benefits, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Over the last three years, these operating activities, including intercompany cash flows, have provided an aggregate of $12,149 million in cash.
Trade receivables held by the equipment operations decreased by $356 million during 2014. The equipment operations sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to financial services (see previous consolidated discussion).
Inventories decreased by $725 million in 2014 due primarily to lower agriculture and turf shipment and production volumes and the sale of the Water operations (see Note 4). Most of these inventories are valued on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
The ratios of inventories on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis (see Note 15), which approximates current cost, to fiscal year cost of sales were 23 percent and 25 percent at October31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
Total interest-bearing debt of the equipment operations was $5,077 million at the end of 2014, compared with $5,951 million at the end of 2013 and $5,870 million at the end of 2012. The ratio of total debt to total capital (total interest-bearing debt and stockholders equity) at the end of 2014, 2013 and 2012 was 36 percent, 37 percent and 46 percent, respectively.
Property and equipment cash expenditures for the equipment operations in 2014 were $1,045 million, compared with $1,155 million in 2013. Capital expenditures in 2015 are estimated to be $875 million.
FINANCIAL SERVICES The financial services operations rely on their ability to raise substantial amounts of funds to finance their receivable and lease portfolios. Their primary sources of funds for this purpose are a combination of commercial paper, term debt, securitization of retail notes, equity capital and borrowings from Deere& Company.
The cash provided by operating activities and financing activities was used primarily for investing activities. Cash flows from the financial services operating activities, including intercompany cash flows, were $1,321 million in 2014. Cash used by investing activities totaled $4,756 million in 2014, due primarily to the cost of receivables (excluding trade and wholesale) and cost of equipment on operating leases exceeding collections of these receivables and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by $3,836 million and an increase in trade receivables and wholesale notes of $782 million. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $4,185 million in 2014, representing primarily an increase in external borrowings of $3,936 million, borrowings from Deere& Company of $368 million and capital investment from Deere& Company of $67 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $150 million to Deere& Company. Cash and cash equivalents increased $737 million.
Over the last three years, the operating activities, including intercompany cash flows, have provided $3,442 million in cash. In addition, an increase in total borrowings of $12,539 million and capital investment from Deere& Company of $453 million provided cash inflows. These amounts have been used mainly to fund receivables (excluding trade and wholesale) and equipment on operating lease acquisitions, which exceeded collections and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by $11,531 million, fund an increase in trade receivables and wholesale notes of $3,453 million, pay dividends to Deere& Company of $380 million and purchase marketable securities that exceeded proceeds from maturities and sales by $239 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased $758 million over the three-year period.
Receivables and equipment on operating leases increased by $3,099 million in 2014, compared with 2013. Total acquisition volumes of receivables (excluding trade and wholesale notes) and cost of equipment on operating leases increased 4 percent in 2014, compared with 2013. The volumes of operating leases, financing leases and revolving charge accounts increased 27 Table of Contents approximately 27 percent, 6 percent and 3 percent, respectively, while retail note volumes were about the same. The amount of wholesale notes increased 11 percent and trade receivables increased 1 percent during 2014. At October31, 2014 and 2013, net receivables and leases administered, which include receivables administered but not owned, were $39,629 million and $36,559 million, respectively.
Total external interest-bearing debt of the financial services operations was $31,882 million at the end of 2014, compared with $28,524 million at the end of 2013 and $26,551 million at the end of 2012. Total external borrowings have changed generally corresponding with the level of the receivable and lease portfolio, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in payables owed to Deere& Company and the change in investment from Deere& Company. The financial services operations ratio of total interest-bearing debt to total stockholders equity was to 7.4 to 1 at the end of 2014, 7.3 to 1 at the end of 2013 and 7.2 to 1 at the end of 2012.
The Capital Corporation has a revolving credit agreement to utilize bank conduit facilities to securitize retail notes (see Note 13). At October31, 2014, the facility had a total capacity, or financing limit, of up to $3,000 million of secured financings at any time. The facility was renewed in November2014 with a capacity of $3,500 million. After a three-year revolving period, unless the banks and Capital Corporation agree to renew, Capital Corporation would liquidate the secured borrowings over time as payments on the retail notes are collected. At October31, 2014, $1,617 million of short-term securitization borrowings was outstanding under the agreement.
During 2014, the financial services operations issued $3,014 million and retired $2,565 million of retail note securitization borrowings. During 2014, the financial services operations also issued $8,171 million and retired $4,390 million of long-term borrowings, which were primarily medium-term notes.
OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS At October31, 2014, the company had approximately $210 million of guarantees issued primarily to banks outside the U.S. related to third-party receivables for the retail financing of John Deere equipment. The company may recover a portion of any required payments incurred under these agreements from repossession of the equipment collateralizing the receivables. The maximum remaining term of the receivables guaranteed at October31, 2014 was approximately six years.
AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The payment schedule for the companys contractual obligations at October31, 2014 in millions of dollars is as follows: Less More than 2&3 4&5 than Total 1 year years years 5years On-balance-sheet Debt* Equipment operations $ 5,091 $ 434 $ 270 $ 775 $ 3,612 Financial services** 31,692 9,962 11,477 6,578 3,675 Total 36,783 10,396 11,747 7,353 7,287 (continued) Less More than 2&3 4&5 than Total 1 year years years 5years Interest relating to debt*** $ 4,777 $ 609 $ 1,069 $ 745 $ 2,354 Accounts payable 2,743 2,611 90 39 3 Capital leases 87 39 42 4 2 Off-balance-sheet Purchase obligations 3,007 2,970 37 Operating leases 371 121 134 70 46 Total $ 47,768 $ 16,746 $ 13,119 $ 8,211 $ 9,692 * Principal payments.
** Securitization borrowings of $4,559 million classified as   short-term on the balance sheet related to the securitization of retail notes   are included in this table based on the expected payment schedule (see Note   18).
*** Includes projected payments related to interest rate   swaps.
The previous table does not include unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of approximately $213 million at October31, 2014, since the timing of future payments is not reasonably estimable at this time (see Note 8). For additional information regarding pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations, short-term borrowings, long-term borrowings and lease obligations, see Notes 7, 18, 20 and 21, respectively.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on the financial statements. The accounting policies below are those management believes are the most critical to the preparation of the companys financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The companys other accounting policies are described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Sales Incentives At the time a sale to a dealer is recognized, the company records an estimate of the future sales incentive costs for allowances and financing programs that will be due when the dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. The estimate is based on historical data, announced incentive programs, field inventory levels and retail sales volumes. The final cost of these programs and the amount of accrual required for a specific sale are fully determined when the dealer sells the equipment to the retail customer. This is due to numerous programs available at any particular time and new programs that may be announced after the company records the sale. Changes in the mix and types of programs affect these estimates, which are reviewed quarterly.
The sales incentive accruals at October31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $1,573 million, $1,531 million and $1,453 million, respectively. The increase in 2014 was due primarily to higher sales incentive accruals related to the U.S. and Canada operations. The increase in 2013 was due primarily to higher sales volumes.
The estimation of the sales incentive accrual is impacted by many assumptions. One of the key assumptions is the historical percent of sales incentive costs to retail sales 28 Table of Contents from dealers. Over the last five fiscal years, this percent has varied by an average of approximately plus or minus .5 percent, compared to the average sales incentive costs to retail sales percent during that period. Holding other assumptions constant, if this estimated cost experience percent were to increase or decrease .5 percent, the sales incentive accrual at October31, 2014 would increase or decrease by approximately $40 million.
Product Warranties At the time a sale to a dealer is recognized, the company records the estimated future warranty costs. The company generally determines its total warranty liability by applying historical claims rate experience to the estimated amount of equipment that has been sold and is still under warranty based on dealer inventories and retail sales. The historical claims rate is primarily determined by a review of five-year claims costs and consideration of current quality developments. Variances in claims experience and the type of warranty programs affect these estimates, which are reviewed quarterly.
The product warranty accruals, excluding extended warranty unamortized premiums, at October31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $809 million, $822 million and $733 million, respectively. The changes were due primarily to lower sales volumes in 2014 and higher sales volumes in 2013.
Estimates used to determine the product warranty accruals are significantly affected by the historical percent of warranty claims costs to sales. Over the last five fiscal years, this percent has varied by an average of approximately plus or minus .08 percent, compared to the average warranty costs to sales percent during that period. Holding other assumptions constant, if this estimated cost experience percent were to increase or decrease .08 percent, the warranty accrual at October31, 2014 would increase or decrease by approximately $35 million.
Postretirement Benefit Obligations Pension obligations and other postretirement employee benefit (OPEB) obligations are based on various assumptions used by the companys actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in assumptions affect future expenses and obligations.
The pension liabilities, net of pension assets, recognized on the balance sheet at October31, 2014 and 2012 were $743 million and $1,817 million, respectively. The pension assets, net of pension liabilities, at October31, 2013 were $40 million. The increase in pension net liabilities in 2014 was due primarily to decreases in discount rates and updated mortality assumptions based on the Society of Actuaries (SOA) RP-2000 base table and mortality projection scale BB. The increase in pension net assets in 2013 was due primarily to the return on plan assets and increases in discount rates, partially offset by interest on the liabilities. The OPEB liabilities, net of OPEB assets, at October31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $5,347 million, $4,769 million and $5,736 million, respectively. The increase in 2014 was due primarily to the change in the mortality assumptions mentioned above and decreases in discount rates, partially offset by a change in the retiree medical credit plan (see Note 7). The decrease in 2013 was due primarily to increases in discount rates and favorable claims experience, partially offset by interest on the liabilities. In October2014, the SOA finalized new mortality tables (RP-2014) and mortality improvement scale (MP-2014). The company does not expect the effects of the new mortality tables on its mortality assumptions and resulting effects on the consolidated financial statements to be significant when adopted.
The effect of hypothetical changes to selected assumptions on the companys major U.S. retirement benefit plans would be as follows in millions of dollars: October31,2014 2015 Increase Increase Percentage (Decrease) (Decrease) Assumptions Change PBO/APBO* Expense Pension Discount rate** +/-.5 $ (634)/676 $ (38)/37 Expected return on assets +/-.5 (48)/48 OPEB Discount rate** +/-.5 (373)/415 (19)/21 Expected return on assets +/-.5 (4)/4 Health care cost trend rate** +/-1.0 835/(639) 107/(83) * Projected   benefit obligation (PBO) for pension plans and accumulated postretirement   benefit obligation (APBO) for OPEB plans.
** Pretax   impact on service cost, interest cost and amortization of gains or losses.
Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment annually and when events or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is reduced below its carrying amount. The end of the fiscal third quarter is the annual measurement date. To test for goodwill impairment, the carrying value of each reporting unit is compared with its fair value. If the carrying value of the goodwill is considered impaired, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill.
An estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit is determined through a combination of comparable market values for similar businesses and discounted cash flows. These estimates can change significantly based on such factors as the reporting units financial performance, economic conditions, interest rates, growth rates, pricing, changes in business strategies and competition.
Based on this testing, the company identified a reporting unit in 2012 for which the goodwill was impaired. None were impaired in 2014 and 2013. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the company recorded a non-cash charge in cost of sales of $33 million pretax, or $31 million after-tax. The charge was associated with a reporting unit included in the agriculture and turf operating segment. The key factor contributing to the impairment was a decline in the reporting units forecasted financial performance (see Note 5).
A 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of the companys reporting units would have had no impact on the carrying value of goodwill at the annual measurement date in 2014.
29 Table of Contents Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses represents an estimate of the losses inherent in the companys receivable portfolio. The level of the allowance is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including historical loss experience by product category, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic conditions and credit risk quality. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly. Different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses.
The total allowance for credit losses at October31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $230 million, $240 million and $243 million, respectively. The allowance decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, due primarily to foreign currency translation, and was approximately the same in 2013 compared to 2012.
The assumptions used in evaluating the companys exposure to credit losses involve estimates and significant judgment. The historical loss experience on the receivable portfolio represents one of the key assumptions involved in determining the allowance for credit losses. Over the last five fiscal years, this percent has varied by an average of approximately plus or minus .16 percent, compared to the average loss experience percent during that period. Holding other assumptions constant, if this estimated loss experience on the receivable portfolio were to increase or decrease .16 percent, the allowance for credit losses at October31, 2014 would increase or decrease by approximately $60 million.
Operating Lease Residual Values The carrying value of equipment on operating leases is affected by the estimated fair values of the equipment at the end of the lease (residual values). Upon termination of the lease, the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third party, in which case the company may record a gain or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sales price. The residual values are dependent on current economic conditions and are reviewed quarterly. Changes in residual value assumptions would affect the amount of depreciation expense and the amount of investment in equipment on operating leases.
The total operating lease residual values at October31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $2,786 million, $2,115 million and $1,676 million, respectively. The changes in 2014 and 2013 were due primarily to the increasing levels of operating leases.
Estimates used in determining end of lease market values for equipment on operating leases significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense. If future market values for this equipment were to decrease 10 percent from the companys present estimates, the total impact would be to increase the companys annual depreciation for equipment on operating leases by approximately $125 million.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MARKET RISK INFORMATION The company is naturally exposed to various interest rate and foreign currency risks. As a result, the company enters into derivative transactions to manage certain of these exposures that arise in the normal course of business and not for the purpose of creating speculative positions or trading. The companys financial services operations manage the relationship of the types and amounts of their funding sources to their receivable and lease portfolio in an effort to diminish risk due to interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, while responding to favorable financing opportunities. Accordingly, from time to time, these operations enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage their interest rate exposure. The company also has foreign currency exposures at some of its foreign and domestic operations related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies. The company has entered into agreements related to the management of these foreign currency transaction risks.
Interest Rate Risk Quarterly, the company uses a combination of cash flow models to assess the sensitivity of its financial instruments with interest rate exposure to changes in market interest rates. The models calculate the effect of adjusting interest rates as follows. Cash flows for financing receivables are discounted at the current prevailing rate for each receivable portfolio. Cash flows for marketable securities are primarily discounted at the applicable benchmark yield curve plus market credit spreads. Cash flows for unsecured borrowings are discounted at the applicable benchmark yield curve plus market credit spreads for similarly rated borrowers. Cash flows for securitized borrowings are discounted at the swap yield curve plus a market credit spread for similarly rated borrowers. Cash flows for interest rate swaps are projected and discounted using forward rates from the swap yield curve at the repricing dates. The net loss in these financial instruments fair values which would be caused by decreasing the interest rates by 10 percent from the market rates at October31, 2014 would have been approximately $18 million. The net loss from decreasing the interest rates by 10 percent at October31, 2013 would have been approximately $14 million.
Foreign Currency Risk In the equipment operations, the companys practice is to hedge significant currency exposures. Worldwide foreign currency exposures are reviewed quarterly. Based on the equipment operations anticipated and committed foreign currency cash inflows, outflows and hedging policy for the next twelve months, the company estimates that a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies through 2015 would decrease the 2015 expected net cash inflows by $16 million. At October31, 2013, a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar under similar assumptions and calculations indicated a potential $10 million adverse effect on the 2014 net cash inflows.
In the financial services operations, the companys policy is to hedge the foreign currency risk if the currency of the borrowings does not match the currency of the receivable portfolio. As a result, a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the financial services cash flows.

35 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMEN TS 1. ORGANIZATION AND CONSOLIDATION Structure of Operations The information in the notes and related commentary are presented in a format which includes data grouped as follows: Equipment Operations  Includes the companys agriculture and turf operations and construction and forestry operations with financial services reflected on the equity basis.
Financial Services  Includes primarily the companys financing operations.
Consolidated  Represents the consolidation of the equipment operations and financial services. References to Deere& Company or the company refer to the entire enterprise.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements represent primarily the consolidation of all companies in which Deere& Company has a controlling interest. Certain variable interest entities (VIEs) are consolidated since the company has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. Deere& Company records its investment in each unconsolidated affiliated company (generally 20 to 50 percent ownership) at its related equity in the net assets of such affiliate (see Note 10). Other investments (less than 20 percent ownership) are recorded at cost.
Variable Interest Entities See Note 13 for VIEs related to securitization of financing receivables.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following are significant accounting policies in addition to those included in other notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Use of Estimates in Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition Sales of equipment and service parts are recorded when the sales price is determinable and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to independent parties based on the sales agreements in effect. In the U.S. and most international locations, this transfer occurs primarily when goods are shipped. In Canada and some other international locations, certain goods are shipped to dealers on a consignment basis under which the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the dealer. Accordingly, in these locations, sales are not recorded until a retail customer has purchased the goods. In all cases, when a sale is recorded by the company, no significant uncertainty exists surrounding the purchasers obligation to pay. No right of return exists on sales of equipment. Service parts and certain attachments returns are estimable and accrued at the time a sale is recognized.
The company makes appropriate provisions based on experience for costs such as doubtful receivables, sales incentives and product warranty.
Financing revenue is recorded over the lives of related receivables using the interest method. Insurance premiums recorded in other income are generally recognized in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred over the contract period. Deferred costs on the origination of financing receivables are recognized as a reduction in finance revenue over the expected lives of the receivables using the interest method. Income and deferred costs on the origination of operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the scheduled lease terms in finance revenue.
Sales Incentives At the time a sale is recognized, the company records an estimate of the future sales incentive costs for allowances and financing programs that will be due when a dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. The estimate is based on historical data, announced incentive programs, field inventory levels and retail sales volumes.
Product Warranties At the time a sale is recognized, the company records the estimated future warranty costs. These costs are usually estimated based on historical warranty claims (see Note 22).
Sales Taxes The company collects and remits taxes assessed by different governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with revenue producing transactions between the company and its customers. These taxes may include sales, use, value-added and some excise taxes. The company reports the collection of these taxes on a net basis (excluded from revenues).
Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs related to the sales of the companys equipment are included in cost of sales.
Advertising Costs Advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred. This expense was $174 million in 2014, $183 million in 2013 and $177 million in 2012.
Depreciation and Amortization Property and equipment, capitalized software and other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. These assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives generally using the straight-line method. Equipment on operating leases is depreciated over the terms of the leases using the straight-line method. Property and equipment expenditures for new and revised products, increased capacity and the replacement or major renewal of significant items are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are generally charged to expense as incurred.
Securitization of Receivables Certain financing receivables are periodically transferred to special purpose entities (SPEs) in securitization transactions (see Note 13). These securitizations qualify as collateral for secured borrowings and no gains or losses are recognized at the time of securitization. The receivables remain on the balance 36 Table of Contents sheet and are classified as Financing receivables securitized - net. The company recognizes finance income over the lives of these receivables using the interest method.
Receivables and Allowances All financing and trade receivables are reported on the balance sheet at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs, the allowance for credit losses, and any deferred fees or costs on originated financing receivables. Allowances for credit losses are maintained in amounts considered to be appropriate in relation to the receivables outstanding based on collection experience, economic conditions and credit risk quality. Receivables are written-off to the allowance when the account is considered uncollectible.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets (including property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) when events or circumstances warrant such a review. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually at the end of the third fiscal quarter each year, or more often if events or circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value below the carrying value. Goodwill is allocated and reviewed for impairment by reporting units, which consist primarily of the operating segments and certain other reporting units. The goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides. To test for goodwill impairment, the carrying value of each reporting unit is compared with its fair value. If the carrying value of the goodwill or long-lived asset is considered impaired, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset (see Note 5).
Derivative Financial Instruments It is the companys policy that derivative transactions are executed only to manage exposures arising in the normal course of business and not for the purpose of creating speculative positions or trading. The companys financial services manage the relationship of the types and amounts of their funding sources to their receivable and lease portfolio in an effort to diminish risk due to interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, while responding to favorable financing opportunities. The company also has foreign currency exposures at some of its foreign and domestic operations related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies.
All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet. Cash collateral received or paid is not offset against the derivative fair values on the balance sheet. Each derivative is designated as either a cash flow hedge, a fair value hedge, or remains undesignated. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to the income statement when the effects of the item being hedged are recognized in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and effective as fair value hedges are recognized currently in net income. These changes are offset in net income to the extent the hedge was effective by fair value changes related to the risk being hedged on the hedged item.
Changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges are recognized currently in the income statement. All ineffective changes in derivative fair values are recognized currently in net income.
All designated hedges are formally documented as to the relationship with the hedged item as well as the risk-management strategy. Both at inception and on an ongoing basis the hedging instrument is assessed as to its effectiveness. If and when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge, or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer likely to occur, or the hedge designation is removed, or the derivative is terminated, the hedge accounting discussed above is discontinued (see Note 27).
Foreign Currency Translation The functional currencies for most of the companys foreign operations are their respective local currencies. The assets and liabilities of these operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the end of the period exchange rates. The revenues and expenses are translated at weighted-average rates for the period. The gains or losses from these translations are recorded in other comprehensive income. Gains or losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary involved and foreign exchange forward contracts are included in net income. The pretax net losses for foreign exchange in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $47 million, $26 million and $96 million, respectively.
3. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS New Accounting Standards Adopted In the first quarter of 2014, the company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.2011-11, Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, which amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 210, Balance Sheet. This ASU requires entities to disclose gross and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and those subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. This includes derivatives and other financial securities arrangements. The adoption did not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements.
In the first quarter of 2014, the company adopted FASB ASU No.2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which amends ASC 220, Comprehensive Income. This ASU requires the disclosure of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and by net income line item. The disclosure may be provided either parenthetically on the face of the financial statements or in the notes. The company provided the disclosure in the notes. The adoption did not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements.
In April2014, the FASB issued ASU No.2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, which amends ASC 205, Presentation of Financial Statements, and ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment. This ASU defines a discontinued 37 Table of Contents operation as a component or group of components that is disposed of or meets the criteria as held for sale and represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results. This ASU requires additional disclosures about discontinued operations and new disclosures for components of an entity that are held for sale or disposed of and are individually significant but do not qualify for presentation as a discontinued operation. Early adoption is permitted for items that have not been reported as disposals or as held for sale in previously issued financial statements. The company early adopted this standard in the second quarter of 2014. As a result, disposals that did not or will not meet the criteria for reporting in discontinued operations are presented in continuing operations.
New Accounting Standards to be Adopted In May2014, the FASB issued ASU No.2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. The effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 using one of two retrospective application methods. The company has not determined the potential effects on the consolidated financial statements.
In June2014, the FASB issued ASU No.2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period, which amends ASC 718, CompensationStock Compensation. This ASU requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. Therefore, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered. The total compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The adoption will not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements.
4. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS In December2013, the company closed the sale of 60 percent of its subsidiary John Deere Landscapes, LLC (Landscapes) to a private equity investment firm affiliated with Clayton, Dubilier& Rice, LLC (CD&R). CD&R acquired newly created shares of cumulative convertible participating preferred stock initially representing 60 percent of the outstanding capital stock of Landscapes on an as-converted basis.
At October31, 2013, the total assets of $505 million and liabilities of $120 million for these operations were classified as held for sale in the consolidated financial statements and written down to realizable value, which consisted of $153 million of trade receivables, $219 million of inventories, $37 million of property and equipment, $106 million of goodwill, $25 million of other intangible assets and $10 million of other assets less a $45 million asset impairment. The related liabilities held for sale consisted of accounts payable and accrued expenses. The total amount of proceeds from the sale at closing was approximately $305 million with no significant gain or loss, which consisted of $174 million equity contribution and third party debt raised by Landscapes.
The equity contribution was in the form of newly issued cumulative convertible participating preferred units representing 60 percent of the voting rights (on an as converted basis), which will rank senior to the companys common stock as to dividends. The preferred units have an initial liquidation preference of $174 million and accrue dividends at a rate of 12 percent per annum. The liquidation preference is subject to the companys rights under the stockholders agreement. Due to preferred dividend payment in additional preferred shares over the first two years, CD&Rs ownership will increase over the two-year period.
The company initially retained 40 percent of the Landscapes business in the form of common stock. As of January2014, the company deconsolidated Landscapes and began reporting the results as an equity investment in unconsolidated affiliates. The fair value of the companys retained equity investment was approximately $80 million at closing. The fair value was determined using an implied equity value approach. This approach used an option pricing model to determine the value of Landscapes total equity based on the liquidation preference of the preferred units of $174 million, as well as the preferred stocks conversion feature and dividend rights. The value of the companys common stock of Landscapes was the difference between the total fair value of the Landscapes equity and the value of CD&Rs preferred stock. The significant unobservable inputs were the expected term of the investment, assumptions about the form of preferred dividend payments and the assumed volatility of the Landscapes enterprise during the term of the investment. Due to the companys continuing involvement through its initial 40 percent interest, Landscapes historical operating results are presented in continuing operations.
38 Table of Contents In May2014, the company closed the sale of the stock and certain assets of the entities that compose the companys Water operations to FIMI Opportunity Funds. The sale was the result of the companys intention to invest its resources in growing core businesses. At April30, 2014, the total assets of $85 million and liabilities of $50 million were classified as held for sale in the consolidated financial statements, which consisted of $57 million of trade receivables, $10 million of other receivables, $49 million of inventories and $5 million of other assets less a $36 million asset impairment. The related liabilities held for sale consisted of accounts payable and accrued expenses of $47 million and retirement benefits and other liabilities of $3 million. The total amount of proceeds from the sale was approximately $35 million with a loss recorded in other operating expenses of $10 million pretax and after-tax in addition to the impairments recorded (see Note 5). The company provides certain business services for a fee during a transition period.
In September2013, the company acquired Bauer Built Manufacturing Inc., a manufacturer of planters located in Paton,Iowa, for approximately $84 million. The fair values assigned to the assets and liabilities related to the acquired entity were approximately $9 million of receivables, $11 million of inventories, $25 million of property and equipment, $13 million of goodwill, $26 million of identifiable intangible assets, $1 million of other assets and $1 million of liabilities. The identifiable intangibles were primarily related to technology, a non-compete contract, customer relationships and a trademark, which have amortization periods with a weighted-average of seven years. The entity was consolidated and the results of these operations have been included in the companys consolidated financial statements in the agriculture and turf operating segment since the date of acquisition. The pro forma results of operations as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of 2013 or comparative fiscal year would not differ significantly from the reported results.
5. SPECIAL ITEMS Impairments In the fourth quarter of 2014, the company recorded non-cash charges in cost of sales for the impairment of long-lived assets of $18 million and other assets of $16 million pretax and after-tax. The assets are part of the companys agriculture and turf operations in China. The impairment is the result of a decline in forecasted financial performance that indicated it was probable the future cash flows would not cover the carrying amount of assets used to manufacture agricultural equipment in that country (see Note 26).
In 2014, the company recorded non-cash charges of $62 million pretax, or $30 million after-tax, related to the Water operations. In the first quarter, a $26 million pretax and after-tax loss was recorded in cost of sales for the impairment of long-lived assets. In the second quarter, an additional non-cash charge of $36 million pretax, or $4 million after-tax, was recorded in other operating expenses for an impairment to write the Water operations down to fair value less costs to sell.
The tax benefits recognized resulted primarily from a change in valuation allowances of the Water operations. These operations were included in the companys agriculture and turf operating segment (see Note 26).
In 2013, the company recorded a non-cash charge for the impairment of long-lived assets of $57 million pretax, or $51 million after-tax. This consists of $50 million pretax, or $44 million after-tax, in the third quarter and $7 million pretax and after-tax in the fourth quarter, related to the companys Water operations, which were included in the agriculture and turf operating segment. The total pretax impairment loss consisted of $50 million recorded in cost of sales and $7 million in selling, administrative and general expenses. The impairments were due to a decline in the forecasted financial performance and a review of strategic options for the business (see Note 26).
In the fourth quarter of 2013, the company recorded a non-cash charge of $45 million pretax and after-tax in other operating expenses for an impairment to write the Landscapes operations down to realizable value. These operations were included in the agriculture and turf operating segment and classified as held for sale at October31, 2013 (see Note 4).
In the fourth quarter of 2012, the company recorded a non-cash charge in cost of sales for the impairment of goodwill of $33 million pretax, or $31 million after-tax, related to the companys Water operations. The goodwill impairment in 2012 was due to a decline in the forecasted financial performance as a result of more complex integration activities. The goodwill in this reporting unit was completely written off in 2012 (see Note 26).
6. CASH FLOW INFORMATION For purposes of the statement of consolidated cash flows, the company considers investments with purchased maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Substantially all of the companys short-term borrowings, excluding the current maturities of long-term borrowings, mature or may require payment within three months or less.
The equipment operations sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to financial services. These intercompany cash flows are eliminated in the consolidated cash flows.
All cash flows from the changes in trade accounts and notes receivable (see Note 12) are classified as operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows as these receivables arise from sales to the companys customers. Cash flows from financing receivables that are related to sales to the companys customers (see Note 12) are also included in operating activities. The remaining financing receivables are related to the financing of equipment sold by independent dealers and are included in investing activities.
The company had the following non-cash operating and investing activities that were not included in the statement of consolidated cash flows. The company transferred inventory to equipment on operating leases of $794 million, $659 million and $563 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The company also had accounts payable related to purchases of property and equipment of $128 million, $198 million and $185 million at October31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
39 Table of Contents Cash payments for interest and income taxes consisted of the following in millions of dollars: 2014 2013 2012 Interest: Equipment operations $ 506 $ 511 $ 420 Financial services 454 502 638 Intercompany eliminations (268) (247) (248) Consolidated $ 692 $ 766 $ 810 Income taxes: Equipment operations $ 1,640 $ 1,863 $ 1,704 Financial services 333 270 207 Intercompany eliminations (253) (179) (167) Consolidated $ 1,720 $ 1,954 $ 1,744 7. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS The company has several defined benefit pension plans and postretirement health care and life insurance plans covering its U.S. employees and employees in certain foreign countries. The company uses an October31 measurement date for these plans.
The components of net periodic pension cost and the assumptions related to the cost consisted of the following in millions of dollars and in percents: 2014 2013 2012 Pensions Service cost $ 244 $ 273 $ 220 Interest cost 480 439 465 Expected return on plan assets (776) (778) (787) Amortization of actuarial loss 177 265 202 Amortization of prior service cost 25 12 47 Early-retirement benefits 3 Other postemployment benefits 5 Settlements/curtailments 9 2 10 Net cost $ 164 $ 213 $ 160 Weighted-average   assumptions Discount rates 4.5% 3.8% 4.4% Rate of compensation increase 3.8% 3.9% 3.9% Expected long-term rates of return 7.5% 7.8% 8.0% The components of net periodic postretirement benefits cost and the assumptions related to the cost consisted of the following in millions of dollars and in percents: 2014 2013 2012 Health care and   life insurance Service cost $ 44 $ 58 $ 49 Interest cost 267 255 281 Expected return on plan assets (72) (84) (100) Amortization of actuarial loss 33 141 136 Amortization of prior service   credit (3) (8) (15) Settlements/curtailments (1) Net cost $ 268 $ 362 $ 351 Weighted-average   assumptions Discount rates 4.7% 3.8% 4.4% Expected long-term rates of return 7.2% 7.5% 7.7% For fiscal year 2012, the participants in one of the companys postretirement health care plans became almost all inactive as described by the applicable accounting standards due to additional retirements. As a result, beginning in 2012, the net actuarial loss for this plan in the table above is being amortized over the longer period for the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants rather than the average remaining service period of the active participants. The amortization of actuarial loss also decreased in 2012 due to lower expected costs from the prescription drug plan to provide group benefits under Medicare PartD as an alternative to collecting the retiree drug subsidy.
The previous pension cost in net income and other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations in other comprehensive income in millions of dollars were as follows: 2014 2013 2012 Pensions Net cost $ 164 $ 213 $ 160 Retirement benefit adjustments   included in other comprehensive (income) loss: Net actuarial (gain) loss 940 (1,481) 999 Prior service (credit) cost (26) 5 Amortization of actuarial loss (177) (265) (202) Amortization of prior service cost (25) (12) (47) Settlements/curtailments (9) (2) (10) Total (gain) loss recognized in   other comprehensive (income) loss 729 (1,786) 745 Total recognized in comprehensive   (income) loss $ 893 $ (1,573) $ 905 The previous postretirement benefits cost in net income and other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations in other comprehensive income in millions of dollars were as follows: 2014 2013 2012 Health care and   life insurance Net cost $ 268 $ 362 $ 351 Retirement benefit adjustments   included in other comprehensive (income) loss: Net actuarial (gain) loss 748 (1,165) 335 Prior service (credit) cost (370) (2) 2 Amortization of actuarial loss (33) (141) (136) Amortization of prior service   credit 3 8 15 Settlements/curtailments 1 Total (gain) loss recognized in   other comprehensive (income) loss 349 (1,300) 216 Total recognized in comprehensive   (income) loss $ 617 $ (938) $ 567 40 Table of Contents The benefit plan obligations, funded status and the assumptions related to the obligations at October31 in millions of dollars follow: Pensions Health Care and Life Insurance 2014 2013 2014 2013 Change in benefit obligations Beginning of year balance $ (10,968) $ (11,834) $ (5,926) $ (7,023) Service cost (244) (273) (44) (58) Interest cost (480) (439) (267) (255) Actuarial gain (loss) (1,306) 951 (757) 1,092 Amendments 26 370 2 Benefits paid 675 655 336 329 Health care subsidies (22) (16) Other postemployment benefits (5) Settlements/curtailments 2 3 Foreign exchange and other 136 (57) 6 3 End of year balance (12,190) (10,968) (6,304) (5,926) Change in plan assets (fair value) Beginning of year balance 11,008 10,017 1,157 1,287 Actual return on plan assets 1,132 1,312 81 158 Employer contribution 87 301 51 37 Benefits paid (675) (655) (336) (329) Settlements/curtailments (2) (3) Foreign exchange and other (103) 36 4 4 End of year balance 11,447 11,008 957 1,157 Funded status $ (743) $ 40 $ (5,347) $ (4,769) Weighted-average assumptions Discount rates 4.0% 4.5% 4.2% 4.7% Rate of compensation increase 3.8% 3.8% For Medicare eligible salaried retirees that primarily retire after July1, 1993 and are eligible for postretirement medical benefits, the companys postretirement benefit plan consists of annual Retiree Medical Credits (RMCs). The RMC is a monetary amount provided to the retirees annually to assist with their medical costs. In October2014, the RMC plan was modified to change the annual cost sharing provisions. For 2015, the annual RMC amount will not increase and the rate of future changes will continue to be set each year by the company. The net effect of this change on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was a decrease of $367 million, which was recognized as a prior service credit in other comprehensive income and will be amortized as a reduction to expense over the active participants remaining years of service to full eligibility.
The amounts recognized at October31 in millions of dollars consist of the following: Pensions Health Care and Life Insurance 2014 2013 2014 2013 Amounts recognized   in balance sheet Noncurrent asset $ 262 $ 551 Current liability (51) (58) $ (21) $ (21) Noncurrent liability (954) (453) (5,326) (4,748) Total $ (743) $ 40 $ (5,347) $ (4,769) Amounts recognized   in accumulated other comprehensive income  pretax Net actuarial loss $ 4,266 $ 3,512 $ 1,675 $ 960 Prior service cost (credit) 42 67 (407) (41) Total $ 4,308 $ 3,579 $ 1,268 $ 919 The total accumulated benefit obligations for all pension plans at October31, 2014 and 2013 was $11,425 million and $10,352 million, respectively.
The accumulated benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $1,381 million and $916 million, respectively, at October31, 2014 and $680 million and $267 million, respectively, at October31, 2013. The projected benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $8,213 million and $7,208 million, respectively, at October31, 2014 and $1,340 million and $829 million, respectively, at October31, 2013.
The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income that are expected to be amortized as net expense (income) during fiscal 2015 in millions of dollars follow: Pensions HealthCare and LifeInsurance Net actuarial loss $ 222 $ 93 Prior service cost (credit) 25 (77) Total $ 247 $ 16 Actuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). To the extent unamortized gains and losses exceed 10% of the higher of the market-related value of assets or the benefit obligation, the excess is amortized as a component of net periodic cost over the remaining service period of the active participants. For plans in which all or almost all of the plans participants are inactive, the amortization period is the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants.
The company expects to contribute approximately $78 million to its pension plans and approximately $26 million to its health care and life insurance plans in 2015, which are primarily direct benefit payments for unfunded plans.
41 Table of Contents The benefits expected to be paid from the benefit plans, which reflect expected future years of service, are as follows in millions of dollars: Pensions HealthCare and LifeInsurance* 2015 $ 677 $ 327 2016 670 334 2017 677 350 2018 682 353 2019 684 353 2020 to   2024 3,485 1,754 * Net of prescription drug group benefit subsidy under Medicare PartD.
The annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits (the health care cost trend rates) used to determine accumulated postretirement benefit obligations were based on the trends for medical and prescription drug claims for pre- and post-65 age groups due to the effects of Medicare. At October 31, 2014, the weighted-average composite trend rates for these obligations were assumed to be a 6.2 percent increase from 2014 to 2015, gradually decreasing to 5 percent from 2022 to 2023 and all future years. The obligations at October 31, 2013 and the cost in 2014 assumed a 6.5 percent increase from 2013 to 2014, gradually decreasing to 5 percent from 2021 to 2022 and all future years. An increase of one percentage point in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations by $859 million and the aggregate of service and interest cost component of net periodic postretirement benefits cost for the year by $47 million. A decrease of one percentage point would decrease the obligations by $658 million and the cost by $35 million.
The discount rate assumptions used to determine the postretirement obligations at October 31, 2014 and 2013 were based on hypothetical AA yield curves represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates. These discount rates represent the rates at which the companys benefit obligations could effectively be settled at the October 31 measurement dates.

Fair values are determined as follows: Cash and Short-Term Investments  Includes accounts that are valued based on the account value, which approximates fair value, and investment funds that are valued on the funds net asset value (NAV) based on the fair value of the underlying securities. Also included are securities that are valued using a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
Equity Securities and Funds  The values are determined primarily by closing prices in the active market in which the equity investment trades, or the funds NAV, based on the fair value of the underlying securities.
Fixed Income Securities and Funds  The securities are valued using either a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, credit risk and prepayment speeds, or they are valued using the closing prices in the active market in which the fixed income investment trades. Fixed income funds are valued using the NAV, based on the fair value of the underlying securities.
Real Estate, Venture Capital, Private Equity, Hedge Funds and Other  Certain of the investments, which are structured as limited partnerships, are valued at estimated fair value based on their proportionate share of the limited partnerships fair value that is determined by the general partner. The general partner values these investments using a combination of NAV, an income approach (primarily estimated cash flows discounted over the expected holding period), or market approach (primarily the valuation of similar securities and properties). Real estate investment trusts are valued at the closing prices in the active markets in which the investment trades. Real estate investment funds, certain hedge funds and other investments are valued at NAV, based on the fair value of the underlying securities.
43 Table of Contents Interest Rate, Foreign Currency and Other Derivative Instruments  The derivatives are valued using either an income approach (discounted cash flow) using market observable inputs, including swap curves and both forward and spot exchange rates, or a market approach (closing prices in the active market in which the derivative instrument trades).
The primary investment objective for the pension plan assets is to maximize the growth of these assets to meet the projected obligations to the beneficiaries over a long period of time, and to do so in a manner that is consistent with the companys earnings strength and risk tolerance. The primary investment objective for the health care plan assets is to provide the company with the financial flexibility to pay the projected obligations to beneficiaries. The asset allocation policy is the most important decision in managing the assets and it is reviewed regularly. The asset allocation policy considers the companys financial strength and long-term asset class risk/return expectations since the obligations are long-term in nature. The current target allocations for pension assets are approximately 48 percent for equity securities, 24 percent for debt securities, 5 percent for real estate and 23 percent for other investments. The target allocations for health care assets are approximately 54 percent for equity securities, 28 percent for debt securities, 3 percent for real estate and 15 percent for other investments. The allocation percentages above include the effects of combining derivatives with other investments to manage asset allocations and exposures to interest rates and foreign currency exchange. The assets are well diversified and are managed by professional investment firms as well as by investment professionals who are company employees. As a result of the companys diversified investment policy, there were no significant concentrations of risk.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects managements expectations of long-term average rates of return on funds invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. A market related value of plan assets is used to calculate the expected return on assets. The market related value recognizes changes in the fair value of pension plan assets systematically over a five-year period. The market related value of the health care and life insurance plan assets equal fair value. The expected return is based on the outlook for inflation and for returns in multiple asset classes, while also considering historical returns, asset allocation and investment strategy. The companys approach has emphasized the long-term nature of the return estimate such that the return assumption is not changed significantly unless there are fundamental changes in capital markets that affect the companys expectations for returns over an extended period of time (i.e., 10 to 20 years). The average annual return of the companys U.S. pension fund was approximately 8.8 percent during the past ten years and approximately 9.7 percent during the past 20 years. Since return premiums over inflation and total returns for major asset classes vary widely even over ten-year periods, recent history is not necessarily indicative of long-term future expected returns. The companys systematic methodology for determining the long-term rate of return for the companys investment strategies supports the long-term expected return assumptions.
The company has created certain Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association trusts (VEBAs) for the funding of postretirement health care benefits. The future expected asset returns for these VEBAs are lower than the expected return on the other pension and health care plan assets due to investment in a higher proportion of liquid securities. These assets are in addition to the other postretirement health care plan assets that have been funded under Section401(h)of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and maintained in a separate account in the companys pension plan trust.
The company has defined contribution plans related to employee investment and savings plans primarily in the U.S. The companys contributions and costs under these plans were $184 million in 2014, $178 million in 2013 and $155 million in 2012. The contribution rate varies primarily based on the companys performance in the prior year and employee participation in the plans.
8 . INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes by taxing jurisdiction and by significant component consisted of the following in millions of dollars: 2014 2013 2012 Current: U.S.: Federal $ 1,217 $ 1,405 $ 1,277 State 126 145 119 Foreign 564 569 355 Total current 1,907 2,119 1,751 Deferred: U.S.: Federal (189) (117) (76) State (11) (11) (7) Foreign (80) (45) (9) Total deferred (280) (173) (92) Provision for   income taxes $ 1,627 $ 1,946 $ 1,659 Based upon the location of the companys operations, the consolidated income before income taxes in the U.S. in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $3,219 million, $4,124 million and $3,582 million, respectively, and in foreign countries was $1,578 million, $1,359 million and $1,152 million, respectively. Certain foreign operations are branches of Deere& Company and are subject to U.S. as well as foreign income tax regulations. The pretax income by location and the preceding analysis of the income tax provision by taxing jurisdiction are not directly related.
44 Table of Contents A comparison of the statutory and effective income tax provision and reasons for related differences in millions of dollars follow: 2014 2013 2012 U.S. federal income tax provision at a statutory rate of 35 percent $ 1,679 $ 1,919 $ 1,657 Increase   (decrease) resulting from: State and   local income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit 75 87 73 German   branch deferred tax write-off 56 Nontaxable   foreign partnership (earnings) losses (305) 43 (172) Nondeductible   impairment charges 32 29 6 Research   and business tax credits (99) (56) (10) Tax rates   on foreign earnings (71) (34) (69) Valuation   allowance on foreign deferred taxes 363 (14) 200 Other-net (47) (84) (26) Provision for income taxes $ 1,627 $ 1,946 $ 1,659 At October31, 2014, accumulated earnings in certain subsidiaries outside the U.S. totaled $4,677 million for which no provision for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes has been made, because it is expected that such earnings will be reinvested outside the U.S. indefinitely. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable. At October31, 2014, the amount of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held by these foreign subsidiaries was $1,025 million.
Deferred income taxes arise because there are certain items that are treated differently for financial accounting than for income tax reporting purposes. An analysis of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities at October31 in millions of dollars follows: 2014 2013 Deferred Tax Assets Deferred Tax Liabilities Deferred Tax Assets Deferred Tax Liabilities Other postretirement benefit   liabilities $ 1,968 $ 1,777 Tax over book depreciation $ 542 $ 582 Accrual for sales allowances 654 602 Lease transactions 404 424 Tax loss and tax credit carryforwards 514 371 Accrual for employee benefits 229 234 Pension liability - net 160 Pension asset - net 137 Share-based compensation 145 142 Inventory 22 161 Goodwill and other intangible   assets 89 100 Allowance for credit losses 73 69 Deferred gains on distributed   foreign earnings 32 26 Deferred compensation 47 44 Undistributed foreign earnings 26 26 Other items 586 116 419 157 Less valuation allowances (637) (254) Deferred income   tax assets and liabilities $ 3,793 $ 1,177 $ 3,591 $ 1,426 Deere& Company files a consolidated federal income tax return in the U.S., which includes the wholly-owned financial services subsidiaries. These subsidiaries account for income taxes generally as if they filed separate income tax returns.
At October31, 2014, certain tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of $514 million, of which $101 million are capital losses, were available with $207 million expiring from 2015 through 2034 and $307 million with an indefinite carryforward period.
In March2013, the company changed the corporate structure of most of its German operations from a branch to a subsidiary of Deere& Company. The change provides the company increased flexibility and efficiency in funding growth in international operations. As a result, the tax status of these operations has changed. Formerly, as a branch these earnings were taxable in the U.S. as earned. As a subsidiary, these earnings will now be taxable in the U.S. if they are distributed to Deere& Company as dividends, which is the same as the companys other foreign subsidiaries. The earnings of the new German subsidiary remain taxable in Germany. Due to the change in tax status and the expectation that the German subsidiarys earnings are indefinitely reinvested, the deferred tax assets and liabilities related to U.S. taxable temporary differences for the previous German branch were written off. The effect of this write-off was a decrease in net deferred tax assets and a charge to the income tax provision of $56 million during the second fiscal quarter of 2013.
A reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at October31 in millions of dollars follows: 2014 2013 2012 Beginning of year   balance $ 272 $ 265 $ 199 Increases to tax positions taken   during the current year 28 30 46 Increases to tax positions taken   during prior years 20 24 54 Decreases to tax positions taken   during prior years (84) (51) (14) Decreases due to lapse of statute   of limitations (4) (5) (9) Foreign exchange (19) 9 (11) End of year   balance $ 213 $ 272 $ 265 The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at October31, 2014 that would affect the effective tax rate if the tax benefits were recognized was $71 million. The remaining liability was related to tax positions for which there are offsetting tax receivables, or the uncertainty was only related to timing. The company expects that any reasonably possible change in the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months would not be significant.
45 Table of Contents The company files its tax returns according to the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates, which includes the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has completed the examination of the companys federal income tax returns for periods prior to 2009. The years 2009 through 2012 federal income tax returns are currently under examination. Various state and foreign income tax returns, including major tax jurisdictions in Canada and Germany, also remain subject to examination by taxing authorities.
The companys policy is to recognize interest related to income taxes in interest expense and interest income, and recognize penalties in selling, administrative and general expenses. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, the total amount of expense from interest and penalties was $11 million, $9 million and $6 million and the interest income was $4 million, $4 million and $1 million, respectively. At October31, 2014 and 2013, the liability for accrued interest and penalties totaled $54 million and $49 million and the receivable for interest was $2 million and $2 million, respectively.
9. OTHER INCOME AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES The major components of other income and other operating expenses consisted of the following in millions of dollars: 2014 2013 2012 Other income Insurance premiums and fees earned $ 297 $ 252 $ 248 Revenues from services 276 256 233 Investment income 17 15 14 Other 234 159 180 Total $ 824 $ 682 $ 675 Other operating   expenses Depreciation of equipment on   operating leases $ 494 $ 389 $ 339 Insurance claims and expenses 324 204 245 Cost of services 151 143 122 Other 124 85 76 Total $ 1,093 $ 821 $ 782 The company issues insurance policies for crop insurance and extended equipment warranties. The crop insurance subsidiary utilizes reinsurance to limit its losses and reduce its exposure to claims. Although reinsurance contracts permit recovery of certain claims from reinsurers, the insurance subsidiary is not relieved of its primary obligation to the policyholders. The premiums ceded by the crop insurance subsidiary in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $288 million, $337 million and $251 million, and claims recoveries on the ceded business were $304 million, $294 million and $493 million, respectively. The amounts from reinsurance are netted against the insurance premiums and fees earned and the insurance claims and expenses in the table above.
10. UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATED COMPANIES Unconsolidated affiliated companies are companies in which Deere& Company generally owns 20 percent to 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares. Deere& Company does not control these companies and accounts for its investments in them on the equity basis. The investments in these companies primarily consist of Bell Equipment Limited (32 percent ownership), Deere-Hitachi Construction Machinery Corporation (50 percent ownership), Ashok Leyland John Deere Construction Equipment Company Private Limited (50 percent ownership), Deere-Hitachi Maquinas de Construcao do Brasil S.A. (50 percent ownership) and John Deere Landscapes, LLC (38 percent ownership). The unconsolidated affiliated companies primarily manufacture or market equipment and landscapes products. Deere& Companys share of the income or loss of these companies is reported in the consolidated income statement under Equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates. The investment in these companies is reported in the consolidated balance sheet under Investments in unconsolidated affiliates.
Combined financial information of the unconsolidated affiliated companies in millions of dollars follows: Operations 2014 2013 2012 Sales $ 3,082 $ 2,299 $ 2,722 Net income (loss) 1 10 (1 ) Deere& Companys equity   in net income (loss) (8 ) (3 ) FinancialPosition 2014 2013 Total assets $ 2,101 $ 1,566 Total external borrowings 648 550 Total net assets 842 547 Deere& Companys share of   the net assets 303 221 Consolidated retained earnings at October31, 2014 include undistributed earnings of the unconsolidated affiliates of $152 million. Dividends from unconsolidated affiliates were $1 million in 2014, $10 million in 2013 and $.2 million in 2012.
46 Table of Contents 11. MARKETABLE SECURITIES All marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a component of stockholders equity. Realized gains or losses from the sales of marketable securities are based on the specific identification method.
The amortized cost and fair value of marketable securities at October31 in millions of dollars follow: Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value 2014 Equity fund $ 39 $ 6 $ 45 Fixed income fund 10 10 U.S. government debt securities 806 3 $ 1 808 Municipal debt securities 31 3 34 Corporate debt securities 167 7 2 172 Mortgage-backed securities* 145 3 2 146 Marketable   securities $ 1,198 $ 22 $ 5 $ 1,215 2013 Equity fund $ 18 $ 2 $ 20 U.S. government debt securities 1,309 5 $ 2 1,312 Municipal debt securities 34 2 36 Corporate debt securities 135 6 3 138 Mortgage-backed securities* 121 2 4 119 Marketable   securities $ 1,617 $ 17 $ 9 $ 1,625 * Primarily issued by U.S. government sponsored enterprises.
The contractual maturities of debt securities at October31, 2014 in millions of dollars follow: Amortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 722 $ 723 Due after one through five years 90 93 Due after five through 10 years 140 143 Due after 10 years 52 55 Mortgage-backed securities 145 146 Debt securities $ 1,149 $ 1,160 Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some securities may be called or prepaid. Because of the potential for prepayment on mortgage-backed securities, they are not categorized by contractual maturity. Proceeds from the sales of available-for-sale securities were $6 million in 2014, $7 million in 2013 and $7 million in 2012. Realized gains, realized losses, the increase (decrease) in net unrealized gains or losses and unrealized losses that have been continuous for over twelve months were not significant in 2014, 2013 and 2012. Unrealized losses at October31, 2014 and 2013 were primarily the result of an increase in interest rates and were not recognized in income due to the ability and intent to hold to maturity. There were no impairment write-downs in the periods reported.
12. RECEIVABLES Trade Accounts and Notes Receivable Trade accounts and notes receivable at October31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars: 2014 2013 Trade accounts and notes: Agriculture and turf $ 2,633 $ 3,127 Construction and forestry 645 631 Trade accounts and   notes receivablenet $ 3,278 $ 3,758 At October31, 2014 and 2013, dealer notes included in the previous table were $61 million and $75 million, and the allowance for credit losses was $55 million and $67 million, respectively.
The equipment operations sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to financial services and provide compensation to these operations at approximate market rates of interest.
Trade accounts and notes receivable primarily arise from sales of goods to independent dealers. Under the terms of the sales to dealers, interest is primarily charged to dealers on outstanding balances, from the earlier of the date when goods are sold to retail customers by the dealer or the expiration of certain interest-free periods granted at the time of the sale to the dealer, until payment is received by the company. Dealers cannot cancel purchases after the equipment is shipped and are responsible for payment even if the equipment is not sold to retail customers. The interest-free periods are determined based on the type of equipment sold and the time of year of the sale. These periods range from one to twelve months for most equipment. Interest-free periods may not be extended. Interest charged may not be forgiven and the past due interest rates exceed market rates. The company evaluates and assesses dealers on an ongoing basis as to their creditworthiness and generally retains a security interest in the goods associated with the trade receivables. The company is obligated to repurchase goods sold to a dealer upon cancellation or termination of the dealers contract for such causes as change in ownership and closeout of the business.
Trade accounts and notes receivable have significant concentrations of credit risk in the agriculture and turf sector and construction and forestry sector as shown in the previous table. On a geographic basis, there is not a disproportionate concentration of credit risk in any area.
47 Table of Contents Financing Receivables Financing receivables at October31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars: 2014 2013 Unrestricted/Securitized Unrestricted/Securitized Retail notes: Equipment: Agriculture and turf $ 16,970 $ 3,975 $ 16,209 $ 3,602 Construction and forestry 1,951 697 1,449 607 Total 18,921 4,672 17,658 4,209 Wholesale notes 5,390 4,802 Revolving charge accounts 2,603 2,593 Financing leases (direct and sales-type) 1,558 1,513 Operating loans 32 Total financing receivables 28,472 4,672 26,598 4,209 Less: Unearned finance income: Equipment notes 753 56 665 42 Financing leases 136 141 Total 889 56 806 42 Allowance for credit losses 161 14 159 14 Financing receivables  net $ 27,422 $ 4,602 $ 25,633 $ 4,153 The residual values for investments in financing leases at October31, 2014 and 2013 totaled $112 million and $94 million, respectively.
Financing receivables have significant concentrations of credit risk in the agriculture and turf sector and construction and forestry sector as shown in the previous table. On a geographic basis, there is not a disproportionate concentration of credit risk in any area. The company generally retains as collateral a security interest in the equipment associated with retail notes, wholesale notes and financing leases.
Financing receivables at October31 related to the companys sales of equipment that were included in the table above consisted of the following in millions of dollars: 2014 2013 Unrestricted Unrestricted Retail notes*: Equipment: Agriculture and turf $ 2,125 $ 2,042 Construction and forestry 403 364 Total 2,528 2,406 Wholesale notes 5,390 4,802 Sales-type leases 844 826 Total $ 8,762 $ 8,034 * These retail notes generally arise from sales of equipment by company-owned dealers or through direct sales.

The maximum term for financing leases is generally five years, while the average term for wholesale notes is less than twelve months.
At October31, 2014 and 2013, the unpaid balances of receivables administered but not owned were $54 million and $82 million, respectively. At October31, 2014 and 2013, worldwide financing receivables administered, which include financing receivables administered but not owned, totaled $32,078 million and $29,868 million, respectively.
Past due balances of financing receivables still accruing finance income represent the total balance held (principal plus accrued interest) with any payment amounts 30 days or more past the contractual payment due date. Non-performing financing receivables represent loans for which the company has ceased accruing finance income. These receivables are generally 120 days delinquent and the estimated uncollectible amount, after charging the dealers withholding account, has been written off to the allowance for credit losses. Finance income for non-performing receivables is recognized on a cash basis. Accrual of finance income is generally resumed when the receivable becomes contractually current and collections are reasonably assured.

Past-due amounts over 30 days represented .90 percent and .82 percent of the receivables financed at October31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The allowance for credit losses represented .54 percent and .58 percent of financing receivables outstanding at October31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, at October31, 2014 and 2013, the companys financial services operations had $196 million and $197 million, respectively, of deposits withheld from dealers and merchants available for potential credit losses.
Financing receivables are considered impaired when it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms. Receivables reviewed for impairment generally include those that are either past due, or have provided bankruptcy notification, or require significant collection efforts. Receivables, which are impaired, are generally classified as non-performing.

A troubled debt restructuring is generally the modification of debt in which a creditor grants a concession it would not otherwise consider to a debtor that is experiencing financial difficulties. These modifications may include a reduction of the stated interest rate, an extension of the maturity dates, a reduction of the face amount or maturity amount of the debt, or a reduction of accrued interest. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company identified 66, 92 and 138 financing receivable contracts, primarily operating loans and retail notes, as troubled debt restructurings with aggregate balances of $3 million, $16 million and $5 million pre-modification and $2 million, $15 million and $4 million post-modification, respectively. During these same periods, there were no significant troubled debt restructurings that subsequently defaulted and were written off. At October31, 2014, the company had no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose accounts were modified in troubled debt restructurings.
Other Receivables Other receivables at October31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars: 2014 2013 Taxes receivable $ 697 $ 868 Reinsurance receivables 502 351 Insurance premium receivables 23 24 Other 278 221 Other receivables $ 1,500 $ 1,464 Reinsurance and insurance premium receivables are associated with the financial services crop insurance subsidiary (see Note 9).
50 Table of Contents 13. SECURITIZATION OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES The company, as a part of its overall funding strategy, periodically transfers certain financing receivables (retail notes) into variable interest entities (VIEs) that are special purpose entities (SPEs), or a non-VIE banking operation, as part of its asset-backed securities programs (securitizations). The structure of these transactions is such that the transfer of the retail notes did not meet the criteria of sales of receivables, and is, therefore, accounted for as a secured borrowing. SPEs utilized in securitizations of retail notes differ from other entities included in the companys consolidated statements because the assets they hold are legally isolated. Use of the assets held by the SPEs or the non-VIE is restricted by terms of the documents governing the securitization transactions.
In securitizations of retail notes related to secured borrowings, the retail notes are transferred to certain SPEs or to a non-VIE banking operation, which in turn issue debt to investors. The resulting secured borrowings are recorded as Short-term securitization borrowings on the balance sheet. The securitized retail notes are recorded as Financing receivables securitized - net on the balance sheet. The total restricted assets on the balance sheet related to these securitizations include the financing receivables securitized less an allowance for credit losses, and other assets primarily representing restricted cash. For those securitizations in which retail notes are transferred into SPEs, the SPEs supporting the secured borrowings are consolidated unless the company does not have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the SPEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the SPEs. No additional support to these SPEs beyond what was previously contractually required has been provided during the reporting periods.
In certain securitizations, the company consolidates the SPEs since it has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the SPEs economic performance through its role as servicer of all the receivables held by the SPEs, and the obligation through variable interests in the SPEs to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the SPEs. The restricted assets (retail notes securitized, allowance for credit losses and other assets) of the consolidated SPEs totaled $3,011 million and $2,626 million at October31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The liabilities (short-term securitization borrowings and accrued interest) of these SPEs totaled $2,942 million and $2,547 million at October31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The credit holders of these SPEs do not have legal recourse to the companys general credit.
In certain securitizations, the company transfers retail notes to a non-VIE banking operation, which is not consolidated since the company does not have a controlling interest in the entity. The companys carrying values and interests related to the securitizations with the unconsolidated non-VIE were restricted assets (retail notes securitized, allowance for credit losses and other assets) of $368 million and $353 million at October31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The liabilities (short-term securitization borrowings and accrued interest) were $351 million and $338 million at October31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
In certain securitizations, the company transfers retail notes into bank-sponsored, multi-seller, commercial paper conduits, which are SPEs that are not consolidated. The company does not service a significant portion of the conduits receivables, and therefore, does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the conduits economic performance. These conduits provide a funding source to the company (as well as other transferors into the conduit) as they fund the retail notes through the issuance of commercial paper. The companys carrying values and variable interest related to these conduits were restricted assets (retail notes securitized, allowance for credit losses and other assets) of $1,331 million and $1,274 million at October31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The liabilities (short-term securitization borrowings and accrued interest) related to these conduits were $1,267 million and $1,225 million at October31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
The companys carrying amount of the liabilities to the unconsolidated conduits, compared to the maximum exposure to loss related to these conduits, which would only be incurred in the event of a complete loss on the restricted assets, was as follows at October31 in millions of dollars: 2014 Carrying value of liabilities $ 1,267 Maximum exposure to loss 1,331 The total assets of unconsolidated VIEs related to securitizations were approximately $40 billion at October31, 2014.
The components of consolidated restricted assets related to secured borrowings in securitization transactions at October31 were as follows in millions of dollars: 2014 2013 Financing receivables securitized (retail notes) $ 4,616 $ 4,167 Allowance for credit losses (14) (14) Other assets 108 100 Total restricted securitized assets $ 4,710 $ 4,253 51 Table of Contents The components of consolidated secured borrowings and other liabilities related to securitizations at October31 were as follows in millions of dollars: 2014 2013 Short-term securitization borrowings $ 4,559 $ 4,109 Accrued interest on borrowings 1 1 Total liabilities   related to restricted securitized   assets $ 4,560 $ 4,110 The secured borrowings related to these restricted securitized retail notes are obligations that are payable as the retail notes are liquidated. Repayment of the secured borrowings depends primarily on cash flows generated by the restricted assets. Due to the companys short-term credit rating, cash collections from these restricted assets are not required to be placed into a segregated collection account until immediately prior to the time payment is required to the secured creditors. At October31, 2014, the maximum remaining term of all securitized retail notes was approximately six years.
14. EQUIPMENT ON OPERATING LEASES Operating leases arise primarily from the leasing of John Deere equipment to retail customers. Initial lease terms generally range from four to 60 months. Net equipment on operating leases totaled $4,016 million and $3,152 million at October31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the terms of the lease. The accumulated depreciation on this equipment was $634 million and $545 million at October31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The corresponding depreciation expense was $494 million in 2014, $389 million in 2013 and $339 million in 2012.
Future payments to be received on operating leases totaled $1,553 million at October31, 2014 and are scheduled in millions of dollars as follows: 2015  $635, 2016  $448, 2017  $280, 2018  $155 and 2019  $35.
15. INVENTORIES Most inventories owned by Deere& Company and its U.S. equipment subsidiaries are valued at cost, on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. Remaining inventories are generally valued at the lower of cost, on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. The value of gross inventories on the LIFO basis represented 65 percent and 63 percent of worldwide gross inventories at FIFO value at October31, 2014 and 2013 respectively. The pretax favorable income effect from the liquidation of LIFO inventory during 2014 was approximately $13 million. If all inventories had been valued on a FIFO basis, estimated inventories by major classification at October31 in millions of dollars would have been as follows: 2014 2013 Raw materials and supplies $ 1,724 $ 1,954 Work-in-process 654 753 Finished goods and parts 3,360 3,757 Total FIFO value 5,738 6,464 Less adjustment to LIFO value 1,528 1,529 Inventories $ 4,210 $ 4,935 16.

Capitalized interest was $6 million, $13 million and $7 million in the same periods, respectively. The cost of leased property and equipment under capital leases of $36 million and $58 million and accumulated depreciation of $15 million and $29 million at October31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, is included in property and equipment.
Capitalized software has an estimated useful life of three years. The amounts of total capitalized software costs, including purchased and internally developed software, classified as Other Assets at October31, 2014 and 2013 were $912 million and $778 million, less accumulated amortization of $656 million and $584 million, respectively. Amortization of these software costs was $106 million in 2014, $93 million in 2013 and $89 million in 2012. The cost of leased software assets under capital leases amounting to $77 million and $46 million at October31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, is included in other assets.
The cost of compliance with foreseeable environmental requirements has been accrued and did not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements.

The components of other intangible assets are as follows in millions of dollars: UsefulLives* (Years) 2014 2013 Amortized intangible assets: Customer lists and relationships 15 $ 20 $ 20 Technology, patents, trademarks and   other 19 90 88 Total at cost 110 108 Less accumulated amortization** 45 35 Total 65 73 Unamortized intangible assets: Licenses 4 4 Other intangible   assets-net $ 69 $ 77 * Weighted-averages ** Accumulated amortization at 2014 and 2013 for customer lists and relationships was $9 million and $8 million and technology, patents, trademarks and other was $36 million and $27 million, respectively.
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. The amortization of other intangible assets in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $11 million, $22 million and $21 million, respectively. The estimated amortization expense for the next five years is as follows in millions of dollars: 2015 - $10, 2016 - $9, 2017 - $9, 2018  $5 and 2019 - $5.
18. TOTAL SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS Total short-term borrowings at October31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars: 2014 2013 Equipment   Operations Commercial paper $ 45 Notes payable to banks 146 $ 259 Long-term borrowings due within one   year 243 821 Total 434 1,080 Financial Services Commercial paper 2,588 3,162 Notes payable to banks 267 139 Long-term borrowings due within one   year* 4,730 4,408 Total 7,585 7,709 Short-term borrowings 8,019 8,789 Financial Services Short-term securitization   borrowings 4,559 4,109 Total short-term   borrowings $ 12,578 $ 12,898 * Includes unamortized fair value adjustments related to interest rate swaps.
The short-term securitization borrowings for financial services are secured by financing receivables (retail notes) on the balance sheet (see Note 13). Although these securitization borrowings are classified as short-term since payment is required if the retail notes are liquidated early, the payment schedule for these borrowings of $4,559 million at October31, 2014 based on the expected liquidation of the retail notes in millions of dollars is as follows: 2015 - $2,383, 2016 - $1,342, 2017 - $636, 2018 - $176, 2019 - $21 and 2020 - $1.
The weighted-average interest rates on total short-term borrowings, excluding current maturities of long-term borrowings, at October31, 2014 and 2013 were 1.0 percent and .8 percent, respectively.
Lines of credit available from U.S. and foreign banks were $6,413 million at October31, 2014. At October31, 2014, $3,367 million of these worldwide lines of credit were unused. For the purpose of computing the unused credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings, excluding secured borrowings and the current portion of long-term borrowings, were primarily considered to constitute utilization. Included in the above lines of credit were long-term credit facility agreements for $2,500 million, expiring in April2018, and $2,500 million, expiring in April2019. The agreements are mutually extendable and the annual facility fees are not significant. These credit agreements require Capital Corporation 53 Table of Contents to maintain its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter and the ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to capital base (total subordinated debt and stockholders equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than 11 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. The credit agreements also require the equipment operations to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capital (total debt and stockholders equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) of 65 percent or less at the end of each fiscal quarter. Under this provision, the companys excess equity capacity and retained earnings balance free of restriction at October31, 2014 was $10,115 million. Alternatively under this provision, the equipment operations had the capacity to incur additional debt of $18,785 million at October31, 2014. All of these requirements of the credit agreements have been met during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.
Deere& Company has an agreement with Capital Corporation pursuant to which it has agreed to continue to own, directly or through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of Capital Corporation and to maintain Capital Corporations consolidated tangible net worth at not less than $50 million. This agreement also obligates Deere& Company to make payments to Capital Corporation such that its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter. Deere& Companys obligations to make payments to Capital Corporation under the agreement are independent of whether Capital Corporation is in default on its indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Further, Deere& Companys obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of Capital Corporations indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Deere& Companys obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of any specific indebtedness, obligation or liability of Capital Corporation and are enforceable only by or in the name of Capital Corporation. No payments were required under this agreement during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.
19. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES Accounts payable and accrued expenses at October31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars: 2014 2013 Equipment   Operations Accounts payable: Trade payables $ 1,661 $ 2,174 Dividends payable 210 192 Other 208 197 Accrued expenses: Dealer sales discounts 1,551 1,491 Employee benefits 1,350 1,408 Product warranties 809 822 Unearned revenue 355 368 Other 1,374 1,339 Total 7,518 7,991 Financial Services Accounts payable: Deposits withheld from dealers and   merchants 196 197 Other 468 368 Accrued expenses: Unearned revenue 647 551 Accrued interest 103 130 Employee benefits 87 86 Insurance claims reserve* 247 197 Other 279 321 Total 2,027 1,850 Eliminations** 991 867 Accounts payable   and accrued expenses $ 8,554 $ 8,974 * See Note 9.

The approximate principal amounts of the financial services long-term borrowings maturing in each of the next five years in millions of dollars are as follows: 2015  $4,724, 2016  $5,220, 2017  $4,279, 2018  $3,432 and 2019  $2,949.
21. LEASES At October31, 2014, future minimum lease payments under capital leases amounted to $87 million as follows: 2015  $39, 2016  $32, 2017  $10, 2018  $3, 2019  $1, and later years $2. Total rental expense for operating leases was $205 million in 2014, $237 million in 2013 and $215 million in 2012. At October31, 2014, future minimum lease payments under operating leases amounted to $371 million as follows: 2015  $121, 2016  $79, 2017  $55, 2018  $38, 2019  $32, and later years $46.
22. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The company generally determines its warranty liability by applying historical claims rate experience to the estimated amount of equipment that has been sold and is still under warranty based on dealer inventories and retail sales. The historical claims rate is primarily determined by a review of five-year claims costs and current quality developments.
The premiums for the companys extended warranties are primarily recognized in income in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred over the contract period. The unamortized extended warranty premiums (deferred revenue) included in the following table totaled $425 million and $342 million at October31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
A reconciliation of the changes in the warranty liability and unearned premiums in millions of dollars follows: WarrantyLiability/ UnearnedPremiums 2014 2013 Beginning of year   balance $ 1,164 $ 1,025 Payments (792) (736 ) Amortization of premiums received (142) (120 ) Accruals for warranties 797 821 Premiums received 228 170 Foreign exchange (21) 4 End of year   balance $ 1,234 $ 1,164 At October31, 2014, the company had approximately $210 million of guarantees issued primarily to banks outside the U.S. related to third-party receivables for the retail financing of John Deere equipment. The company may recover a portion of any required payments incurred under these agreements from repossession of the equipment collateralizing the receivables. At October31, 2014, the company had accrued losses of approximately $7 million under these agreements. The maximum remaining term of the receivables guaranteed at October31, 2014 was approximately six years.
At October31, 2014, the company had commitments of approximately $237 million for the construction and acquisition of property and equipment. At October31, 2014, the company also had pledged or restricted assets of $102 million, primarily as collateral for borrowings and restricted other assets. In addition, see Note 13 for restricted assets associated with borrowings related to securitizations.
The company also had other miscellaneous contingencies totaling approximately $70 million at October31, 2014, for which it believes the probability for payment is substantially remote. The accrued liability for these contingencies was not material at October31, 2014.
The company is subject to various unresolved legal actions which arise in the normal course of its business, the most prevalent of which relate to product liability (including asbestos related liability), retail credit, software licensing, patent, trademark and environmental matters. The company believes the reasonably possible range of losses for these unresolved legal actions in addition to the amounts accrued would not have a material effect on its financial statements.
23. CAPITAL STOCK Changes in the common stock account in millions were as follows: Numberof SharesIssued Amount Balance at October31, 2011 536.4 $ 3,252 Stock options and other 100 Balance at October31, 2012 536.4 3,352 Stock options and other 172 Balance at October31, 2013 536.4 3,524 Stock options and other 151 Balance at   October31, 2014 536.4 $ 3,675 55 Table of Contents The number of common shares the company is authorized to issue is 1,200 million. The number of authorized preferred shares, none of which has been issued, is nine million.
The Board of Directors at its meeting in December 2013 authorized the repurchase of up to $8,000 million of additional common stock (93.5 million shares based on the October 31, 2014 closing common stock price of $85.54 per share). At October 31, 2014, this repurchase program had $6,230 million (72.8 million shares at the same price) remaining to be repurchased. Repurchases of the companys common stock under this plan will be made from time to time, at the companys discretion, in the open market.
A reconciliation of basic and diluted net income per share attributable to Deere & Company follows in millions, except per share amounts: 2014 2013 2012 Net income attributable to Deere   & Company $ 3,161.7 $ 3,537.3 $ 3,064.7 Less income allocable to   participating securities 1.0 .9 .8 Income allocable to common stock $ 3,160.7 $ 3,536.4 $ 3,063.9 Average shares outstanding 363.0 385.3 397.1 Basic per share $ 8.71 $ 9.18 $ 7.72 Average shares outstanding 363.0 385.3 397.1 Effect of dilutive stock options 3.1 3.9 4.4 Total potential shares outstanding 366.1 389.2 401.5 Diluted per share $ 8.63 $ 9.09 $ 7.63 All stock options outstanding were included in the computation during 2014, 2013 and 2012, except 2.4 million options in 2014, 2.4 million in 2013 and 1.8 million in 2012 that had an antidilutive effect under the treasury stock method.
24. STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS The company issues stock options and restricted stock awards to key employees under plans approved by stockholders. Restricted stock is also issued to nonemployee directors for their services as directors under a plan approved by stockholders. Options are awarded with the exercise price equal to the market price and become exercisable in one to three years after grant. Options expire ten years after the date of grant. Restricted stock awards generally vest after three years. The compensation cost for stock options, service based restricted stock units and market/service based restricted stock units, which is based on the fair value at the grant date, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite period the employee is required to render service. The compensation cost for performance/service based units, which is based on the fair value at the grant date, is recognized over the employees requisite service period and periodically adjusted for the probable number of shares to be awarded. According to these plans at October 31, 2014, the company is authorized to grant an additional 7.2 million shares related to stock options or restricted stock.
The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using a binomial lattice option valuation model. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from traded call options on the companys stock. The expected volatilities are constructed from the following three components: the starting implied volatility of short-term call options traded within a few days of the valuation date; the predicted implied volatility of long-term call options; and the trend in implied volatilities over the span of the call options time to maturity. The company uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior and employee termination within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rates utilized for periods throughout the contractual life of the options are based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of grant.
The assumptions used for the binomial lattice model to determine the fair value of options follow: 2014 2013 2012 Risk-free interest rate .03% - 2.9% .04% - 1.7% .01% - 2.0% Expected dividends 2.3% 2.3% 1.9% Expected volatility 25.9% - 32.0% 26.6% - 32.5% 34.1% - 41.9% Weighted-average volatility 31.9% 32.4% 33.6% Expected term (in years) 7.3 - 7.4 7.3 - 7.9 6.8 - 7.8 Stock option activity at October 31, 2014 and changes during 2014 in millions of dollars and shares follow: Shares Exercise Price* Remaining Contractual Term (Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Outstanding at   beginning of year 15.7 $ 64.82 Granted 2.4 87.46 Exercised (3.0 ) 48.53 Expired or forfeited (.2 ) 85.99 Outstanding at end   of year 14.9 71.64 6.06 $ 218.4 Exercisable at end   of year 9.0 67.02 5.21 171.5 * Weighted-averages The weighted-average grant-date fair values of options granted during 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $24.74, $23.73 and $22.51, respectively. The total intrinsic values of options exercised during 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $125 million, $183 million and $88 million, respectively. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, cash received from stock option exercises was $149 million, $175 million and $61 million with tax benefits of $46 million, $68 million and $33 million, respectively.
The company granted 236 thousand, 254 thousand and 266 thousand restricted stock units to employees and nonemployee directors in 2014, 2013 and 2012, of which 102 thousand, 110 thousand and 122 thousand are subject to service based only conditions, 67 thousand, 72 thousand and 72 thousand are subject to performance/service based conditions, 67 thousand, 72 thousand and 72 thousand are subject to market/service based conditions, respectively. The service based only units award one share of common stock for each unit at the end of the vesting period and include dividend equivalent payments.
56 Table of Contents The performance/service based units are subject to a performance metric based on the companys compound annual revenue growth rate, compared to a benchmark group of companies over the vesting period. The market/service based units are subject to a market related metric based on total shareholder return, compared to the same benchmark group of companies over the vesting period. The performance/service based units and the market/service based units both award common stock in a range of zero to 200 percent for each unit granted based on the level of the metric achieved and do not include dividend equivalent payments over the vesting period. The weighted-average fair values of the service based only units at the grant dates during 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $87.16, $86.88 and $75.27 per unit, respectively, based on the market price of a share of underlying common stock. The fair value of the performance/service based units at the grant date during 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $81.53, $80.73 and $70.14 per unit, respectively, based on the market price of a share of underlying common stock excluding dividends. The fair value of the market/service based units at the grant date during 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $116.86, $106.75 and $92.85 per unit, respectively, based on a lattice valuation model excluding dividends.
The companys nonvested restricted shares at October 31, 2014 and changes during 2014 in millions of shares follow: Shares Grant-Date Fair Value* Service based only Nonvested at beginning of year .3 $ 81.00 Granted .1 87.16 Vested (.1) 81.67 Nonvested at end of year .3 83.00 Performance/service   and market/service based Nonvested at beginning of year .4 $ 88.86 Granted .1 99.20 Vested (.1) 76.17 Performance change .1 76.17 Expired or forfeited (.1) 107.10 Nonvested at end of year .4 91.30 * Weighted-averages During 2014, 2013 and 2012, the total share-based compensation expense was $79 million, $81 million and $75 million, respectively, with recognized income tax benefits of $29 million, $30 million and $28 million, respectively. At October 31, 2014, there was $44 million of total unrecognized compensation cost from share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans, which is related to nonvested shares. This compensation is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two years. The total grant-date fair values of stock options and restricted shares vested during 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $69 million, $68 million and $76 million, respectively.
The company currently uses shares that have been repurchased through its stock repurchase programs to satisfy share option exercises. At October 31, 2014, the company had 191 million shares in treasury stock and 73 million shares remaining to be repurchased under its current publicly announced repurchase program (see Note 23).

Fair values of the financing receivables that were issued long-term were based on the discounted values of their related cash flows at interest rates currently being offered by the company for similar financing receivables. The fair values of the remaining financing receivables approximated the carrying amounts.
Fair values of long-term borrowings and short-term securitization borrowings were based on current market quotes for identical or similar borrowings and credit risk, or on the discounted values of their related cash flows at current market interest rates. Certain long-term borrowings have been swapped to current variable interest rates. The carrying values of these long-term borrowings included adjustments related to fair value hedges.

There were no transfers   between Level 1 and Level 2 during 2014, 2013 and 2012.
** Primarily   issued by U.S. government sponsored enterprises.
*** Excluded   from this table were cash equivalents, which were carried at cost that   approximates fair value. The cash equivalents consist primarily of money   market funds that were Level 1 measurements.

See Note 5 for impairments.
Level 1 measurements consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 measurements include significant other observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets; observable inputs such as interest rates and yield curves; and other market-corroborated inputs. Level 3 measurements include significant unobservable inputs.
59 Table of Contents Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the company uses various methods including market and income approaches. The company utilizes valuation models and techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs. The models are industry-standard models that consider various assumptions including time values and yield curves as well as other economic measures. These valuation techniques are consistently applied.
The following is a description of the valuation methodologies the company uses to measure certain financial instruments on the balance sheet and nonmonetary assets at fair value: Marketable Securities  The portfolio of investments is primarily valued on a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, credit risk and prepayment speeds.
Derivatives  The companys derivative financial instruments consist of interest rate swaps and caps, foreign currency forwards and swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps. The portfolio is valued based on an income approach (discounted cash flow) using market observable inputs, including swap curves and both forward and spot exchange rates for currencies.
Financing Receivables  Specific reserve impairments are based on the fair value of the collateral, which is measured using a market approach (appraisal values or realizable values). Inputs include a selection of realizable values (see Note 12).
Goodwill  The impairment is based on the implied fair value measured as the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of the units identifiable net assets. An estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by an income approach (discounted cash flows), which includes inputs such as interest rates.
Property and Equipment-Net  The impairments are measured at the lower of the carrying amount, or fair value. The valuations were based on a cost approach. The inputs include replacement cost estimates adjusted for physical deterioration and economic obsolescence.
Other Intangible Assets-Net  The impairments are measured at the lower of the carrying amount, or fair value. The valuations were based on an income approach (discounted cash flows). The inputs include estimates of future cash flows.
Other Assets  The impairments are measured at the lower of the carrying amount, or fair value. The valuations were based on a market approach. The inputs include sales of comparable assets.
Assets Held For Sale-Water Operations  The impairment of the disposal group was measured at the lower of carrying amount, or fair value less cost to sell. Fair value was based on the probable sale price. The inputs included estimates of the final sale price (see Note 5).
27. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS Cash Flow Hedges Certain interest rate and cross-currency interest rate contracts (swaps) were designated as hedges of future cash flows from borrowings. The total notional amounts of the receive-variable/ pay-fixed interest rate contracts at October 31, 2014 and 2013 were $3,050 million and $3,100 million, respectively. The total notional amounts of the cross-currency interest rate contracts were $70 million and $816 million at October 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The effective portions of the fair value gains or losses on these cash flow hedges were recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and subsequently reclassified into interest expense or other operating expenses (foreign exchange) in the same periods during which the hedged transactions affected earnings. These amounts offset the effects of interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate changes on the related borrowings. Any ineffective portions of the gains or losses on all cash flow interest rate contracts designated as cash flow hedges were recognized currently in interest expense or other operating expenses (foreign exchange) and were not material during any years presented. The cash flows from these contracts were recorded in operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows.
The amount of loss recorded in OCI at October 31, 2014 that is expected to be reclassified to interest expense or other operating expenses in the next twelve months if interest rates or exchange rates remain unchanged is approximately $6 million after-tax. These contracts mature in up to 47 months. There were no gains or losses reclassified from OCI to earnings based on the probability that the original forecasted transaction would not occur.
Fair Value Hedges Certain interest rate contracts (swaps) were designated as fair value hedges of borrowings. The total notional amounts of the receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate contracts at October 31, 2014 and 2013 were $8,798 million and $7,380 million, respectively. The effective portions of the fair value gains or losses on these contracts were offset by fair value gains or losses on the hedged items (fixed-rate borrowings). Any ineffective portions of the gains or losses were recognized currently in interest expense. The ineffective portions were a loss of $2 million in 2014 and none in 2013. The cash flows from these contracts were recorded in operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows.
The gains (losses) on these contracts and the underlying borrowings recorded in interest expense follow in millions of dollars: 2014 2013 Interest rate contracts* $ (13 ) $ (244 ) Borrowings** 11 244 * Includes   changes in fair values of interest rate contracts excluding net accrued interest   income of $168 million and $155 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively.
** Includes   adjustments for fair values of hedged borrowings excluding accrued interest   expense of $267 million and $261 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively.
60 Table of Contents Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments The company has certain interest rate contracts (swaps and caps), foreign exchange contracts (forwards and swaps) and cross-currency interest rate contracts (swaps), which were not formally designated as hedges. These derivatives were held as economic hedges for underlying interest rate or foreign currency exposures primarily for certain borrowings and purchases or sales of inventory. The total notional amounts of the interest rate swaps at October31, 2014 and 2013 were $6,317 million and $5,627 million, the foreign exchange contracts were $3,524 million and $3,800 million and the cross-currency interest rate contracts were $98 million and $85 million, respectively. At October31, 2014 and 2013, there were also $1,703 million and $1,641 million, respectively, of interest rate caps purchased and the same amounts sold at the same capped interest rate to facilitate borrowings through securitization of retail notes. The fair value gains or losses from the interest rate contracts were recognized currently in interest expense and the gains or losses from foreign exchange contracts in cost of sales or other operating expenses, generally offsetting over time the expenses on the exposures being hedged. The cash flows from these non-designated contracts were recorded in operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows.
Fair values of derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheet at October31 in millions of dollars follow: 2014 2013 Other   Assets Designated as   hedging instruments: Interest rate   contracts $ 266 $ 295 Cross-currency   interest rate contracts 13 14 Total designated 279 309 Not designated as   hedging instruments: Interest rate   contracts 53 52 Foreign exchange   contracts 18 32 Cross-currency   interest rate contracts 3 1 Total not designated 74 85 Total derivatives $ 353 $ 394 Accounts   Payable and Accrued Expenses Designated as   hedging instruments: Interest rate   contracts $ 35 $ 71 Cross-currency   interest rate contracts 16 Total designated 35 87 Not designated as   hedging instruments: Interest rate   contracts 46 49 Foreign exchange   contracts 29 42 Cross-currency   interest rate contracts 1 Total not designated 75 92 Total derivatives $ 110 $ 179 The classification and gains (losses) including accrued interest expense related to derivative instruments on the statement of consolidated income consisted of the following in millions of dollars: 2014 2013 2012 Fair   Value Hedges Interest rate   contracts  Interest expense $ 155 $ (89) $ 335 Cash   Flow Hedges Recognized in OCI (Effective Portion): Interest rate   contracts  OCI (pretax)* (10) (15) (28) Foreign exchange   contracts  OCI (pretax)* (4) 58 (33) Reclassified from   OCI (Effective Portion): Interest rate   contracts  Interest expense* (13) (22) (16) Foreign exchange   contracts  Other expense* (6) 49 (38) Recognized Directly   in Income (Ineffective   Portion) ** ** ** Not   Designated as Hedges Interest rate   contracts  Interest expense* $ 3 $ (6) $ (13) Foreign exchange   contracts  Cost of sales 25 35 (12) Foreign exchange   contracts  Other expense* 79 20 7 Total not designated $ 107 $ 49 $ (18) * Includes   interest and foreign exchange gains (losses) from cross-currency interest   rate contracts.
** The   amounts are not significant.
Counterparty Risk and Collateral Certain of the companys derivative agreements contain credit support provisions that may require the company to post collateral based on the size of the net liability positions and credit ratings. The aggregate fair value of all derivatives with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position at October31, 2014 and October31, 2013, was $57 million and $91 million, respectively. The company, due to its credit rating and amounts of net liability position, has not posted any collateral. If the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered, the company would be required to post collateral up to an amount equal to this liability position, prior to considering applicable netting provisions.
Derivative instruments are subject to significant concentrations of credit risk to the banking sector. The company manages individual counterparty exposure by setting limits that consider the credit rating of the counterparty, the credit default swap spread of the counterparty and other financial commitments and exposures between the company and the counterparty banks. All interest rate derivatives are transacted under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) documentation. Some of these agreements include credit support provisions. Each master agreement permits the net settlement of amounts owed in the event of default or termination.

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA DATA FOR THE YEARS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2014, 2013 AND 2012 The companys operations are presently organized and reported in three major business segments described as follows: The agriculture and turf segment primarily manufactures and distributes a full line of agriculture and turf equipment and related service parts  including large, medium and utility tractors; loaders; combines, corn pickers, cotton and sugarcane harvesters and related front-end equipment and sugarcane loaders; tillage, seeding and application equipment, including sprayers, nutrient management and soil preparation machinery; hay and forage equipment, including self-propelled forage harvesters and attachments, balers and mowers; turf and utility equipment, including riding lawn equipment and walk-behind mowers, golf course equipment, utility vehicles, and commercial mowing equipment, along with a broad line of associated implements; integrated agricultural management systems technology and solutions; and other outdoor power products.
The construction and forestry segment primarily manufactures and distributes a broad range of machines and service parts used in construction, earthmoving, material handling and timber harvesting  including backhoe loaders; crawler dozers and loaders; four-wheel-drive loaders; excavators; motor graders; articulated dump trucks; landscape loaders; skid-steer loaders; and log skidders, feller bunchers, log loaders, log forwarders, log harvesters and related attachments.
The products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets.
The financial services segment primarily finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the financial services segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, finances retail revolving charge accounts and offers crop risk mitigation products and extended equipment warranties. The company signed an agreement in December 2014 to sell the stock of the Crop Insurance operations (see Note 30).
Because of integrated manufacturing operations and common administrative and marketing support, a substantial number of allocations must be made to determine operating segment and geographic area data. Intersegment sales and revenues represent sales of components and finance charges, which are generally based on market prices.
Information relating to operations by operating segment in millions of dollars follows. In addition to the following unaffiliated sales and revenues by segment, intersegment sales and revenues in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: agriculture and turf net sales of $89 million, $69 million and $84 million, construction and forestry net sales of $1 million, $2 million and $1 million, and financial services revenues of $228 million, $220 million and $219 million, respectively.

In December 2014, the companys financial services operations issued Australian dollar denominated medium-term notes of $227 million due in December 2019.
In December2014, the company entered into an agreement to sell all of the stock of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, John Deere Insurance Company and John Deere Risk Protection,Inc. (collectively, the Crop Insurance operations) to Farmers Mutual Hail Insurance Company of Iowa. The Crop Insurance operations provide crop risk mitigation products and are included in the financial services operating segment.
The company is projecting to close the sale by March2015.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October31, 2014, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission .
