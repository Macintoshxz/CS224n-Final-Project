BUSINESS.
Products Deere& Company (the Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, John Deere) have operations which are categorized into three major business segments.
The agriculture and turf segment primarily manufactures and distributes a full line of agriculture and turf equipment and related service parts  including large, medium and utility tractors; loaders; combines, corn pickers, cotton and sugarcane harvesters and related front-end equipment and sugarcane loaders; tillage, seeding and application equipment, including sprayers, nutrient management and soil preparation machinery; hay and forage equipment, including self-propelled forage harvesters and attachments, balers and mowers; turf and utility equipment, including riding lawn equipment and walk-behind mowers, golf course equipment, utility vehicles, and commercial mowing equipment, along with a broad line of associated implements; integrated agricultural management systems technology; precision agricultural irrigation equipment and supplies; landscape and nursery products; and other outdoor power products.
The construction and forestry segment primarily manufactures and distributes a broad range of machines and service parts used in construction, earthmoving, material handling and timber harvesting  including backhoe loaders; crawler dozers and loaders; four-wheel-drive loaders; excavators; motor graders; articulated dump trucks; landscape loaders; skid-steer loaders; and log skidders, feller bunchers, log loaders, log forwarders, log harvesters and related attachments.
The products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets.
The financial services segment primarily finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the financial services segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, finances retail revolving charge accounts and operating loans and offers crop risk mitigation products and extended equipment warranties.
John Deeres worldwide agriculture and turf operations and construction and forestry operations are sometimes referred to as the equipment operations. The financial services segment is sometimes referred to as the financial services operations.
Additional information is presented in the discussion of business segment and geographic area results on pages22-23. The John Deere enterprise has manufactured agricultural machinery since 1837. The present Company was incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1958.
The Companys internet address is http://www.JohnDeere.com . Through that address, the Companys annual report on Form10-K, quarterly reports on Form10-Q, current reports on Form8-K and amendments to those reports are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Securities and Exchange Commission or Commission). The information contained on the Companys website is not included in, or incorporated by reference into, this annual report on Form10-K.
Market Conditions and Outlook The Companys equipment sales are projected to increase by about 5 percent for fiscal year 2013 and about 10 percent for the first quarter, compared with the same periods of 2012. For fiscal year 2013, net income attributable to Deere&Company is anticipated to be approximately $3.2 billion.
Agriculture& Turf.
The Companys worldwide sales of agriculture and turf equipment are forecast to increase by about 4 percent for fiscal year 2013. Relatively high commodity prices and strong farm incomes are expected to continue supporting a favorable level of demand for farm machinery during the year. The Companys sales are expected to benefit from global expansion and lines of advanced new equipment.
Industry sales for agricultural machinery in the United States (U.S.) and Canada are forecast to be about the same for 2013 in relation to the prior years healthy levels. Caution around the U.S. livestock and dairy sectors is expected to offset continued strength in demand for large equipment, such as high-horsepower tractors.
Fiscal year industry sales in the European Union (EU)27 nations of Western and Central Europe are forecast to be about the same to 5 percent lower due to continuing deterioration in the overall economy and a poor harvest in the U.K. Sales in the Commonwealth of Independent States are expected to be modestly higher in 2013. In South America, industry sales are projected to increase about 10 percent as a result of favorable commodity prices and increased planting intentions. Industry sales in Asia are projected to be approximately the same as 2012 due to softer economic conditions in India and China.
2 Table of Contents U.S. and Canada industry sales of turf and utility equipment are expected to increase about 5 percent for 2013, reflecting some improvement in the U.S. economy. The Companys sales are expected to increase more than the industry due to the impact of new products.
Construction& Forestry.
The Companys worldwide sales of construction and forestry equipment are forecast to increase by about 8 percent for fiscal year 2013 due in part to modest improvement in U.S. economic conditions. Sales in world forestry markets are projected to be about the same for the year as further weakness in European markets offsets stronger demand in the U.S.
Financial Services.
Fiscal year 2013 net income attributable to Deere& Company for the financial services operations is expected to be approximately $500 million. The forecast improvement is primarily due to expected growth in the credit portfolio and lower crop insurance claims. These factors are projected to be partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses, which is anticipated to return to a more typical level.
2012 Consolidated Results Compared with 2011 Worldwide net income attributable to Deere& Company in 2012 was $3,065 million, or $7.63 per share diluted ($7.72 basic), compared with $2,800 million, or $6.63 per share diluted ($6.71 basic), in 2011. Net sales and revenues increased 13 percent to $36,157 million in 2012, compared with $32,013 million in 2011. Net sales of the equipment operations increased 14 percent in 2012 to $33,501 million from $29,466 million last year. The sales increase included improved price realization of 4 percent and an unfavorable foreign currency translation of 3 percent. Net sales in the U.S. and Canada increased 20 percent in 2012. Net sales outside the U.S. and Canada increased by 5 percent in 2012, which included an unfavorable effect of 6 percent for foreign currency translation.
Worldwide equipment operations had an operating profit of $4,397 million in 2012, compared with $3,839 million in 2011. The higher operating profit was primarily due to the impact of improved price realization and higher shipment volumes, partially offset by higher production and raw material costs, unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange, increased research and development expenses, higher selling, administrative and general expenses and a goodwill impairment charge. The increase in production costs related to new products, engine emission requirements and incentive compensation expenses.
The equipment operations net income was $2,616 million in 2012, compared with $2,329 million in 2011. The same operating factors mentioned above, as well as an increase in the effective tax rate and interest expense affected these results.
Net income of the financial services operations attributable to Deere& Company in 2012 decreased to $460 million, compared with $471 million in 2011. The decrease was primarily a result of increased selling, administrative and general expenses, higher reserves for crop insurance claims and narrower financing spreads, partially offset by growth in the credit portfolio and a lower provision for credit losses. Additional information is presented in the discussion of the Worldwide Financial Services Operations on page22.
The cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2012 was 74.6 percent, compared with 74.4 percent last year. The increase was primarily due to higher production costs, increased raw material costs and unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange, partially offset by improved price realization.
Additional information on 2012 results is presented on pages 21-23.
EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS Agriculture and Turf The John Deere agriculture and turf segment manufactures and distributes a full line of agricultural and turf equipment and related service parts. The segments global operating model is designed to enable faster geographic growth and increase the segments competitiveness. Pursuant to this model, the segment consolidates all markets into four geographical customer focus areas to facilitate comprehensive customer understanding and deliver optimal customer service. As an additional component of the global operating model, the segments equipment operations are consolidated into five product platforms  crop harvesting (combines, corn pickers, cotton and sugarcane harvesters and related front-end equipment and sugarcane loaders); turf and utility (utility vehicles, riding lawn equipment, walk-behind mowers, commercial mowing equipment, golf course equipment, implements for mowing, tilling, snow and debris handling, aerating and many other residential, commercial, golf and sports turf care applications; and other outdoor power products); hay and forage (self-propelled forage harvesters and attachments, balers and mowers); crop care (tillage, seeding and application equipment, including sprayers, nutrient management and soil preparation machinery); and tractors (loaders and large, medium and utility tractors and related attachments). John Deere also purchases certain products from other manufacturers for resale.
Additionally, the segment offers ancillary products and services supporting its agricultural and turf equipment customers. John Deere Landscapes, a unit of the segment, distributes irrigation equipment, nursery products and landscape supplies, including seed, fertilizer 3 Table of Contents and hardscape materials, primarily to landscape service professionals. John Deere Water, also a unit of the agriculture and turf segment, manufactures and distributes precision agricultural irrigation equipment and supplies.
The segment also provides integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems. John Deere has developed a comprehensive agricultural management systems approach using advanced communications, data collection and global satellite positioning technologies to enable farmers to better control input costs and yields, improve soil conservation and minimize chemical use and to gather information. John Deeres advanced telematics systems remotely connect agricultural equipment owners, business managers and dealers to agricultural equipment in the field, providing real-time alerts and information about equipment location, utilization, performance and maintenance to improve productivity and efficiency.
In addition to the John Deere brand, the agriculture and turf segment purchases and sells a variety of equipment attachments under the Frontier, Kemper and Green Systems brand names, and manufactures and sells walk-behind mowers and scarifiers in select European countries under the SABO brand name. John Deere manufactures its agricultural and turf equipment for sale primarily through independent retail dealer networks, and also builds products for sale by mass retailers, including The Home Depot and Lowes.
Sales of agricultural equipment are affected by total farm cash receipts, which reflect levels of farm commodity prices, acreage planted, crop yields and governmental policies, including the amount and timing of government payments. Sales are also influenced by general economic conditions, farm land prices, farmers debt levels and access to financing, interest and exchange rates, agricultural trends, including the production of and demand for renewable fuels, labor availability and costs, energy costs and other input costs associated with farming. Other important factors affecting new agricultural equipment sales are the value and level of used equipment, including tractors, harvesting equipment, self-propelled sprayers, hay and forage equipment and seeding equipment. Weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of agricultural equipment purchasers.
Innovations in machinery and technology also influence agricultural equipment purchasing. For example, larger, more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations. Large, cost-efficient, highly-mechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output. The large-size agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to John Deere. A large proportion of the equipment operations total agricultural equipment sales in the U.S. and Canada, and a growing proportion of sales in many countries outside the U.S. and Canada, is comprised of tractors over 100 horsepower, self-propelled combines, self-propelled cotton pickers, self-propelled forage harvesters, self-propelled sprayers and seeding equipment. However, as John Deere expands its business globally, especially in developing countries where demand for smaller equipment is greater, John Deeres sales of small tractors below 100 horsepower are increasing and John Deere offers a number of harvesting solutions to support the development of mechanized harvesting of grain, oilseeds, cotton, sugar and biomass.
Retail sales of lawn and garden tractors, compact utility tractors, residential and commercial mowers, utility vehicles, and golf and turf equipment are influenced by weather conditions, consumer spending patterns and general economic conditions.
Seasonality . Seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during various times of the year. Seasonal demand must be estimated in advance, and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year. For certain equipment, John Deere offers early order discounts to retail customers. Production schedules are based, in part, on these early order programs. The segment incurs substantial seasonal variation in cash flows to finance production and inventory of agricultural equipment. The segment also incurs costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand. New combine and cotton harvesting equipment has been sold under early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to customers who take delivery of machines during off-season periods. In Australia, Canada and the U.S., there are typically several used equipment trade-in transactions for most new agricultural equipment sales. To provide support to its dealers for these used equipment trade-ins, John Deere provides dealers in these countries with a pool of funds, awarded to dealers as a percentage of the dealer cost for certain new eligible equipment sales. Dealers can use these funds to defray the costs of carrying or marketing used equipment inventory or to provide financing incentives to customers purchasing the used equipment.
Retail demand for turf and utility equipment is normally higher in the second and third quarters. John Deere is pursuing a strategy of building and shipping as close to retail demand as possible. Consequently, to increase asset turnover and reduce the average level of field inventories through the year, production and shipment schedules of these product lines will normally be proportionately higher in the second and third quarters of each year, corresponding closely to the seasonal pattern of retail sales.
Construction and Forestry John Deere construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry equipment includes a broad range of backhoe loaders, crawler dozers and loaders, four-wheel-drive loaders, excavators, motor graders, articulated dump trucks, landscape loaders, skid-steer loaders, log skidders, log feller bunchers, log loaders, log forwarders, log harvesters and a variety of attachments. John Deere provides the most complete line of forestry machines and attachments available in the world. The segments forestry machines are distributed under the John Deere brand name and forestry attachments are distributed under the John Deere and Waratah brand names. In addition 4 Table of Contents to the equipment manufactured by the construction and forestry segment, John Deere purchases certain products from other manufacturers for resale. The segment also provides comprehensive fleet management telematics solutions designed to improve customer productivity and efficiency through access to fleet location, utilization and maintenance information.
The prevailing levels of residential, commercial and public construction and the condition of the forestry products industry influence retail sales of John Deere construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry equipment. General economic conditions, the level of interest rates, the availability of credit and certain commodity prices such as those applicable to pulp, paper and saw logs also influence sales.
Pursuant to agreements between John Deere and Bell Equipment Limited (Bell), Belllicenses John Deere to manufacture articulated dump trucksin the U.S. for John Deeres distribution under the John Deere brand name inNorth, Central and South America. John Deere licenses Bell to manufacture and sell certain John Deere-designed construction equipment in specified territories of Africa.Bell is also the distributor of certain John Deere-manufactured construction equipment under the Bellbrand nameand forestry equipment under the John Deerebrand namein certain territories of Africa. Bell and John Deere have agreed to terminate the articulated dump truck manufacturing and license agreements over the next few years, and John Deere will retain Bell as a dealer of construction and forestry equipment.
John Deere and Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. (Hitachi) have a joint venture for the manufacture of hydraulic excavators and track log loaders in the U.S. and Canada and a joint venture for the manufacture of excavators in Brazil. John Deere distributes Hitachi brands of construction and mining equipment in North, Central and South America. John Deere also has supply agreements with Hitachi under which a range of construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry products manufactured by John Deere in the U.S., Finland and New Zealand are distributed by Hitachi in certain Asian markets.
The construction and forestry segment also has a joint venture in China for the manufacture of hydraulic excavators with Xuzhou Bohui Science& Technology Development Co. Ltd.

7 Table of Contents Backlog Orders The dollar amount of backlog orders for the agriculture and turf segment believed to be firm was approximately $5.5 billion at October31, 2012, compared with $5.5 billion at October31, 2011. The agriculture and turf backlog is generally highest in the second and third quarters due to seasonal buying trends in these industries. John Deere generally produces and ships its construction and forestry equipment on average within approximately 60 days after an order is deemed to become firm. Therefore, no significant amount of construction and forestry backlog orders accumulates during any period.
Trade Accounts and Notes Receivable Trade accounts and notes receivable arise primarily from sales of goods to independent dealers. Most trade receivables originated by the equipment operations are purchased by the financial services operations. The equipment operations compensate the financial services operations at approximate market rates of interest for these receivables. Additional information appears in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
FINANCIAL SERVICES U.S. and Canada . The financial services segment primarily provides and administers financing for retail purchases from John Deere dealers of new equipment manufactured by John Deeres agriculture and turf and construction and forestry segments and used equipment taken in trade for this equipment.
The Company and John Deere Construction& Forestry Company (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) are referred to as the sales companies. John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation), a U.S. financial services subsidiary, generally purchases retail installment sales and loan contracts (retail notes) from the sales companies. These retail notes are acquired by the sales companies through John Deere retail dealers in the U.S. John Deere Financial Inc. (formerly John Deere Credit Inc.), a Canadian financial services subsidiary, purchases and finances retail notes acquired by John Deere Canada ULC, the Companys Canadian sales branch. The terms of retail notes and the basis on which the financial services operations acquire retail notes from the sales companies are governed by agreements with the sales companies. The financial services segment also finances and services revolving charge accounts, in most cases acquired from and offered through merchants in the agriculture and turf and construction and forestry markets (revolving charge accounts). Further, the financial services operations finance and service operating loans. Additionally, the financial services operations provide wholesale financing for inventories of John Deere agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment owned by dealers of those products (wholesale notes). The various financing options offered by the financial services operations are designed to enhance sales of John Deere products and generate financing income for the financial services operations. In the U.S., certain subsidiaries included in the financial services segment offer crop risk mitigation products and certain subsidiaries offer extended equipment warranties.
Retail notes acquired by the sales companies are immediately sold to the financial services operations. The equipment operations are the financial services operations major source of business, but many retail purchasers of John Deere products finance their purchases outside the John Deere organization through a variety of sources, including commercial banks and finance and leasing companies.
The financial services operations offer retail leases to equipment users in the U.S. A small number of leases are executed with units of local government. Leases are usually written for periods of four months to sixty months, and typically contain an option permitting the customer to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term. Retail leases are also offered in a generally similar manner to customers in Canada through John Deere Financial Inc. and John Deere Canada ULC.
The financial services operations terms for financing equipment retail sales (other than smaller items financed with unsecured revolving charge accounts) provide for retention of a security interest in the equipment financed. The financial services operations guidelines for minimum down payments, which vary with the types of equipment and repayment provisions, are generally 10 percent to 30 percent. Finance charges are sometimes waived for specified periods or reduced on certain John Deere products sold or leased in advance of the season of use or in other sales promotions. The financial services operations generally receive compensation from the sales companies at approximate market interest rates for periods during which finance charges are waived or reduced on the retail notes or leases. The cost is accounted for as a deduction in arriving at net sales by the equipment operations.
The Company has an agreement with Capital Corporation to make payments to Capital Corporation such that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than 1.05 to 1 for any fiscal quarter. For 2012 and 2011, Capital Corporations ratios were 2.30 to 1 and 2.18 to 1, respectively, and never less than 2.02 to 1 and 1.96 to 1 for any fiscal quarter of 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company has also committed to continue to own, directly or through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of Capital Corporation and to maintain Capital Corporations consolidated tangible net worth at not less than $50 million. The Companys obligations to make payments to Capital Corporation under the agreement are independent of whether Capital Corporation is in default on its indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Further, the Companys obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of Capital Corporations indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. The Companys obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of any specific indebtedness, obligation or liability of 8 Table of Contents Capital Corporation and are enforceable only by or in the name of Capital Corporation. No payments were required under this agreement in 2012 or 2011.
Outside the U.S. and Canada . The financial services operations also offer financing, primarily for John Deere products, in Australia, China,India, New Zealand, Russia, Thailand and in several other countries in Asia, Europe and in Latin America. In certain areas, financing is offered through cooperation agreements or joint ventures. The manner in which the financial services operations offer financing in these countries is affected by a variety of country specific laws, regulations and customs, including those governing property rights and debtor obligations, that are subject to change and that may introduce greater risk to the financial services operations.
The financial services operations also offer to select customers and dealers credit enhanced international export financing for the purchase of John Deere products.
Additional information on the financial services operations appears on pages22, 23, 26 and 28.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS John Deere is subject to a wide variety of local, state and federal environmental laws and regulations in the U.S., as well as the environmental laws and regulations of other countries in which John Deere conducts business. John Deere strives to comply, and believes it is in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations. However, failure to comply with these regulations could lead to fines and other penalties. John Deere is involved in the evaluation and clean-up of a limited number of sites but does not expect that these matters, or other expenses or liabilities John Deere may incur in connection with any noncompliance with environmental laws or regulations or the cleanup of any additional properties, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows or competitive position of John Deere. With respect to acquired properties and businesses or properties and businesses acquired in the future, John Deere conducts due diligence into potential exposure to environmental liabilities, but cannot be certain that it has identified or will identify all adverse environmental conditions. Compliance with these laws and regulations has added, and will continue to add, to the cost of John Deeres products.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has issued increasingly stringent regulations concerning permissible emissions of off-road engines, and governmental agencies throughout the world are similarly enacting more stringent laws to reduce off-road engine emissions. John Deere has achieved, and plans to continue to achieve, compliance with these regulations through significant investments in the development of new engine technologies and after-treatment systems. Compliance with emissions regulations has added, and will continue to add, to the cost of John Deeres products.
EMPLOYEES At October31, 2012, John Deere had approximately 66,900 full-time employees, including approximately 34,600 employees in the U.S. and Canada. From time to time, John Deere also retains consultants, independent contractors, and temporary and part-time workers. Unions are certified as bargaining agents for approximately 82 percent of John Deeres U.S. production and maintenance employees. Approximately 11,700 of John Deeres U.S. production and maintenance workers are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the United Auto Workers (UAW), with an expiration date of October1, 2015.
Unions also represent the majority of employees at John Deere manufacturing facilities outside the U.S.

RISK FACTORS.
The following risks are considered the most significant to John Deeres business based upon current knowledge, information and assumptions. This discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis beginning on page21, including the risks and uncertainties described in the Safe Harbor Statement on pages23 through 25, and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page36. These risk factors and other forward-looking statements that relate to future events, expectations, trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change, and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all of the Companys businesses. Although each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. The Company, except as required by law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factors discussion, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. The risks described in this Annual Report on Form10-K, and the Safe Harbor Statement in this report, are not the only risks faced by the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties may also materially affect the Companys business, financial condition or operating results. You should not consider these risk factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
International, national and regional trade laws, regulations and policies (particularly those related to or restricting global trade) and government farm programs and policies, could significantly impair John Deeres profitability and growth prospects .
International, national and regional laws, regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting trade, including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors, could harm John Deeres multinational business. John Deeres profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace. Restricted access to global markets impairs John Deeres ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world, and limits the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis. While trade agreements may expand opportunities, trade restrictions could limit John Deeres ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair John Deeres ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products and services. Furthermore, the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to John Deeres agricultural and forestry customers. Policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities, including the outcome of the global negotiations under the auspices of the World Trade Organization, could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities which may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world. John Deeres agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world. Furthermore, trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living, which could negatively impact John Deeres future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food, fuel and infrastructure. Furthermore, changes in government farm programs and policies, including direct payment and other subsidies, can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment.
Changes in government banking, monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on John Deere.
Policies of the U.S. and other governments regarding banking, monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity, stabilize financial markets and/or address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on John Deeres customers and markets. John Deeres operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform which could have an adverse affect on the financial services segment and John Deeres customers by limiting their ability to finance purchases of John Deere products. Governmental policies on taxes and spending can also affect John Deere, especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development.
Changing worldwide demand for food and for different forms of bio-energy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain John Deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements.
Changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the worlds growing food and bio-energy demands, driven in part by government policies and a growing world population, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment. While higher commodity prices will benefit John Deeres crop producing agricultural equipment customers, higher commodity prices also result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers. Furthermore, changing bio-fuel demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise, with corresponding changes in equipment demands. Finally, changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization could affect demand for John Deeres gasoline- or diesel-fueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards.
11 Table of Contents As John Deere seeks to expand its business globally, growth opportunities may be impacted by greater political, economic and social uncertainty and the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of John Deeres competition, customer base and product offerings.
John Deeres efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to, and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in, additional geographic markets including but not limited to Brazil, China,India and Russia. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than John Deeres other markets. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes John Deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices, business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation and repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies. Expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the Companys financial results. As these emerging geographic markets become more important to John Deere, its competitors are also seeking to expand their production capacities and sales in these same markets. While John Deere maintains a positive corporate image and the John Deere brand is widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets, the brand is less well known in some emerging markets which could impede John Deeres efforts to successfully compete in these markets. Although John Deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances, John Deeres reputation and/or business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful.
John Deere operates in highly competitive markets.
John Deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets. John Deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. John Deere competes on the basis of product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, customer service and price. Aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or John Deeres failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect John Deeres business, results of operations and financial condition.
John Deere is subject to extensive anti-corruption laws and regulations.
John Deeres international operations must comply with U.S. law, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The FCPA and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in the foreign jurisdiction. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws, violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and an adverse effect on John Deeres reputation, business and results of operations and financial condition.
Negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for John Deeres equipment and services, limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs.
The demand for John Deeres products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment, cautious consumer spending, lower corporate earnings and lower business investment. Negative or uncertain economic conditions causing John Deeres customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their propensity to purchase John Deeres equipment. Sustained or negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment. John Deeres turf operations and its construction and forestry segment are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions. Sustained low levels or decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations. If negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy, there could be a similar effect on John Deeres agricultural equipment sales. In addition, negative or uncertain economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in capital market liquidity conditions. Such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce the Companys earnings and cash flows. Additionally, the Companys investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets, which would negatively affect earnings.
Concerns regarding the European debt crisis and market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro, the potential re-introduction of individual currencies within the Eurozone, or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely, could adversely affect John Deeres business, results of operations and financing.
Concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone countries. These concerns could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Eurozone countries, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the 12 Table of Contents Companys euro- denominated assets and obligations. In addition, concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in Europe and globally could have an adverse impact on the capital markets generally, and more specifically on the ability of the Company and John Deeres customers, suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses, to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, on the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for John Deere products.
The Companys consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries, creating currency translation risk.
John Deere operates in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. John Deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. Additionally, the reporting currency for the Companys consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of John Deeres assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries currencies. Those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the Companys consolidated financial statements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar could have a significant impact on John Deeres results.
Because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere sales worldwide, John Deeres operations and financial results could be impacted materially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry.
In recent years, negative economic conditions have frequently had an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates. The financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deeres sales worldwide. The financial services segment is exposed to the credit risk of its various counterparties. The financial services segment may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The financial services segments inability to access funds or to access funds at cost effective rates to support its financing activities to John Deeres customers could have a material adverse effect on John Deeres business. The financial services segments liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital to meet future cash flow requirements and fund operations and the costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities. Additionally, negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels, resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact the financial services segments write-offs and provision for credit losses.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Act), and the regulations implementing the Act, could impose additional supervisory, financial and reporting requirements and compliance costs on John Deere and John Deeres financial services operations and could therefore adversely affect John Deere and its financial services segment.
The Act was enacted on July21, 2010 to broadly reform practices in the financial services industry, including equipment financing and securitizations. The Act directs federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and others, to adopt rulesto regulate depository institutions, non-bank financial institutions, thrift holding companies, the consumer finance industry and the capital markets, including certain commercial transactions such as derivatives contracts. Although the effects of the Act on the capital markets and the financial industry are largely unknown until regulations have been finalized and implemented, the Act and its regulations are expected to impose additional reporting requirements, leverage, capital and other supervisory and financial standards and restrictions that increase regulatory-related compliance costs for John Deere and John Deeres financial services operations and could adversely affect John Deere and its financial services segments funding activities, liquidity, structure (including relationships with affiliates), operations and performance. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board has recently proposed capital requirements for certain institutions including thrift holding companies. Under the proposed rules, certain risk-based capital levels would need to be maintained in order to avoid the imposition of new restrictions on making dividends and other capital payouts. Moreover, our operations, including those outside of the United States, could also be impacted by non-U.S. regulatory reforms, including Basel III, being implemented to further regulatenon-U.S. financial institutions and markets.
John Deeres business results depend largely on its ability to understand its customers specific preferences and requirements, and to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demand.
John Deeres ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality, at affordable prices, is critical to its success. This requires a thorough understanding of John Deeres existing and potential customers on a global basis, particularly in potential high growth markets, including Brazil, China,India and Russia. Failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on John Deeres business.
13 Table of Contents John Deeres business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agricultural and turf equipment.
Poor or unusual weather conditions, particularly during the planting and early growing season, can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of John Deeres customers, particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment. The timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production. Insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields. Excessive rain or flooding can also prevent planting from occurring at optimal times, and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth. Temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields, and may also affect disease incidence. Temperature affects the rate of growth, crop maturity and crop quality. Natural calamities such as regional floods, hurricanes or other storms, and droughts can have significant negative effects on agricultural production. The resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment. In addition, poor or unusual weather conditions at critical periods in the planting, growing or harvesting seasons can impact the profitability of crop risk mitigation products. Sales of turf equipment, particularly during the important spring selling season, can be dramatically impacted by weather. Adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment. Drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes.
Changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials, components and whole goods could result in production disruptions or increased costs and lower profits on sales of John Deere products .
John Deere requires access to various raw materials, components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products. Changes in the availability and price of these raw materials, components and whole goods, which have fluctuated significantly in the past and which are more likely to occur during times of economic volatility, can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business, particularly if John Deere, due to pricing considerations or other factors, was unable to recover the increased costs from its customers. John Deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials, components and whole goods required to manufacture its products. Certain components and parts used in John Deeres products are available from a single supplier and cannot be re-sourced quickly. Supply chain disruptions due to supplier financial viability, capacity constraints, business continuity, quality, delivery, or disruptions due to weather related or natural disaster events could affect John Deeres operations and profitability.
John Deeres equipment operations and financial services segment are subject to interest rate risks. Changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment, adversely affect interest margins and limit the ability to access capital markets while increasing borrowing costs.
Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of John Deeres customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for John Deere equipment and customers ability to repay obligations to John Deere. In addition, credit market dislocations, including as a result of Eurozone concerns, could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to John Deeres financial services segment because such costs affect the segments ability to offer customers competitive financing rates. In addition, changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Companys net interest rate marginthe difference between the yield the Company earns on its assets and the interest rates the Company pays for funding, which could in turn affect the Companys net interest income and earnings. Actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks, can affect the availability and cost of funding for the Company and can increase the Companys cost of capital and hurt its competitive position.
John Deeres operations are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations of federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over John Deeres international operations.
In addition, private civil litigation on these subjects has increased, primarily in the U.S.
Enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental, health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and defense costs, and result in significant fines or penalties. In addition, new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict John Deeres operations, require significant expenditures to achieve compliance and/or give rise to civil or criminal liability. There can be no assurance that violations of such legislation and/or regulations, or private civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental, health or safety impacts of John Deeres operations, would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on John Deeres business, financial condition or results of operations.
Increasingly stringent engine emission standards could impact John Deeres ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment which could negatively affect business results.
John Deeres equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction standards, including USEPA, Interim Tier 4, Final Tier 4 and EU Stage IIIb and Stage IV non-road diesel emission requirements. These standards are applicable to many engines manufactured by John Deere and used in many models of John Deere agricultural and construction and forestry equipment. In order to meet these standards, John Deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs and is introducing many new equipment models, largely due to the implementation of these more rigorous standards. While John Deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements, and does not currently foresee significant obstacles that 14 Table of Contents would prevent timely compliance, these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect John Deeres ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines, which could negatively impact business results.
John Deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and could be further impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities, suppliers and customers.
There is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. These considerations may lead to international, national, regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the future. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, including John Deere, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to John Deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances, facilities improvements and energy costs (which would increase John Deeres operating costs through higher utility, transportation and materials costs). The regulation of GHG emissions from non-road sources could require further changes to the design of John Deeres engines and equipment. Increased input costs, such as fuel and fertilizer, and compliance-related costs could also impact customer operations and demand for John Deere equipment. Because the impact of any future GHG legislative, regulatory or product standard requirements on John Deeres global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of the mandates or standards, John Deere is unable to predict its significance at this time.
Furthermore, the potential physical impacts of climate change on John Deeres facilities, suppliers and customers, and therefore on John Deeres operations, are highly uncertain, and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions. These may include changes in weather patterns (including drought and rainfall levels), water availability, storm patterns and intensities, and temperature levels. These potential physical effects may adversely impact the demand for John Deeres products and the cost, production, sales and financial performance of John Deeres operations.
Sustained increases in funding obligations under the Companys pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition.
The Company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees, which impose on us funding obligations. The Company uses many assumptions in calculating its future payment obligations under the plans. Significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns being lower than expected. The Company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future. These factors could significantly increase the Companys payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.
The reallocation of radio frequency (RF) spectrums could disrupt or degrade the reliability of John Deeres high precision augmented Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, which could impair John Deeres ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers profitability.
John Deeres current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems, as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment, depend upon the use of RF signals. These signals include, but are not limited to, GPS signals, other GPS-like satellite signals, augmented GPS services and other RF equipment which link equipment, operations, owners, dealers and technicians. These radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national agencies. Any international or national reallocation of frequency bands, including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing, or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands, could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of John Deeres GPS-based products, which could negatively affect John Deeres ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions. For John Deeres agricultural customers, the inability to use high-precision augmented GPS signals (or other RF signals) could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance, seed, fertilizer, fuel and wage costs. For construction customers, disrupting GPS (or RF) applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs, as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies. These cost increases could significantly reduce customers profitability and demand for John Deere products.
Security breaches and other disruptions to John Deeres information technology infrastructure could interfere with John Deeres operations, and could compromise John Deeres and its customers and suppliers information, exposing John Deere to liability which would cause John Deeres business and reputation to suffer.
In the ordinary course of business, John Deere relies upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of John Deere equipment and from customers of John Deeres financial services operations. John Deere uses information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, John Deere collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, the proprietary business information of our customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of John Deeres customers and employees, in data centers and on information 15 Table of Contents technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks, and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to John Deeres business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, John Deeres information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance, or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise John Deeres networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and damage John Deeres reputation, which could adversely affect John Deeres business.

20 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 OVERVIEW Organization The companys equipment operations generate revenues and cash primarily from the sale of equipment to John Deere dealers and distributors. The equipment operations manufacture and distribute a full line of agricultural equipment; a variety of commercial, consumer and landscapes equipment and products; and a broad range of equipment for construction and forestry. The companys financial services primarily provide credit services, which mainly finance sales and leases of equipment by John Deere dealers and trade receivables purchased from the equipment operations. In addition, financial services offer crop risk mitigation products and extended equipment warranties. The information in the following discussion is presented in a format that includes information grouped as consolidated, equipment operations and financial services. The company also views its operations as consisting of two geographic areas, the U.S. and Canada, and outside the U.S. and Canada. The companys operating segments consist of agriculture and turf, construction and forestry, and financial services.
Trends and Economic Conditions The companys agriculture and turf equipment sales increased 13 percent in 2012 and are forecast to increase by about 4 percent for 2013. Industry agricultural machinery sales in the U.S. and Canada for 2013 are forecast to remain approximately the same, compared to healthy levels in 2012. Industry sales in the European Union (EU)27 nations of Western and Central Europe are forecast to be about the same to 5 percent lower in 2013, while sales in the Commonwealth of Independent States are expected to be modestly higher. South American industry sales are projected to increase approximately 10 percent in 2013. Industry sales in Asia are forecast to be about the same in 2013. Industry sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to increase approximately 5 percent. The companys construction and forestry sales increased 19 percent in 2012 and are forecast to increase by about 8 percent in 2013. Sales in world forestry markets are expected to be approximately the same in 2013. Net income of the companys financial services operations attributable to Deere& Company in 2013 is expected to be approximately $500 million.
Items of concern include the uncertainty of the effectiveness of governmental actions in respect to monetary and fiscal policies, the global economic recovery, the impact of sovereign and state debt, capital market disruptions, trade agreements, the availability of credit for the companys customers and suppliers, and financial regulatory reform. Drought conditions and significant volatility in the price of many commodities could also impact the companys results. The availability of certain components that could impact the companys ability to meet production schedules continues to be monitored. Designing and producing products with engines that continue to meet high performance standards and increasingly stringent emissions regulations is one of the companys major priorities.
The company remains well positioned to carry out its growth plans and capitalize on positive long-term trends. With support from employees, dealers and suppliers, the companys plans for helping meet the worlds growing need for food and infrastructure are moving ahead successfully.
2012 COMPARED WITH 2011 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Worldwide net income attributable to Deere& Company in 2012 was $3,065 million, or $7.63 per share diluted ($7.72 basic), compared with $2,800 million, or $6.63 per share diluted ($6.71 basic), in 2011. Net sales and revenues increased 13 percent to $36,157 million in 2012, compared with $32,013 million in 2011. Net sales of the equipment operations increased 14 percent in 2012 to $33,501 million from $29,466 million last year. The sales increase included improved price realization of 4 percent and an unfavorable foreign currency translation effect of 3 percent. Net sales in the U.S. and Canada increased 20 percent in 2012. Net sales outside the U.S. and Canada increased by 5 percent in 2012, which included an unfavorable effect of 6 percent for foreign currency translation.
Worldwide equipment operations had an operating profit of $4,397 million in 2012, compared with $3,839 million in 2011. The higher operating profit was primarily due to the impact of improved price realization and higher shipment volumes, partially offset by higher production and raw material costs, unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange, increased research and development expenses, higher selling, administrative and general expenses and a goodwill impairment charge (see Note 5). The increase in production costs related to new products, engine emission requirements and incentive compensation expenses.
The equipment operations net income was $2,616 million in 2012, compared with $2,329 million in 2011. The same operating factors mentioned above, as well as an increase in the effective tax rate and interest expense affected these results.
Net income of the financial services operations attributable to Deere& Company in 2012 decreased to $460 million, compared with $471 million in 2011. The decrease was primarily a result of increased selling, administrative and general expenses, higher reserves for crop insurance claims and narrower financing spreads, partially offset by growth in the credit portfolio and a lower provision for credit losses. Additional information is presented in the following discussion of the Worldwide Financial Services Operations.
The cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2012 was 74.6 percent, compared with 74.4 percent last year. The increase was primarily due to higher production costs, increased raw material costs and unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange, partially offset by improved price realization.
21 Table of Contents Finance and interest income increased this year due to a larger average credit portfolio, partially offset by lower average financing rates. Other income increased primarily as a result of an increase in service revenues and insurance premiums and fees. Research and development costs increased primarily as a result of increased spending in support of new products and more stringent emission requirements. Selling, administrative and general expenses increased primarily due to growth and incentive compensation expenses. Interest expense increased due to higher average borrowings, partially offset by lower average borrowing rates. Other operating expenses increased primarily due to higher crop insurance claims and costs and depreciation of equipment on operating leases.
The company has several defined benefit pension plans and defined benefit health care and life insurance plans. The companys postretirement benefit costs for these plans in 2012 were $511 million, compared with $603 million in 2011. The long-term expected return on plan assets, which is reflected in these costs, was an expected gain of 8.0 percent in 2012 and 2011, or $887 million in 2012 and $906 million in 2011. The actual return was a gain of $849 million in 2012 and $695 million in 2011. In 2013, the expected return will be approximately 7.8 percent. The companys postretirement costs in 2013 are expected to increase approximately $75 million. The company makes any required contributions to the plan assets under applicable regulations and voluntary contributions from time to time based on the companys liquidity and ability to make tax-deductible contributions. Total company contributions to the plans were $478 million in 2012 and $122 million in 2011, which include direct benefit payments for unfunded plans. These contributions also included voluntary contributions to plan assets of $350 million in 2012. Total company contributions in 2013 are expected to be approximately $554 million, which includes voluntary contributions of approximately $450 million. The company has no significant required contributions to pension plan assets in 2013 under applicable funding regulations. See the following discussion of Critical Accounting Policies for more information about postretirement benefit obligations.
BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS The following discussion relates to operating results by reportable segment and geographic area. Operating profit is income before certain external interest expense, certain foreign exchange gains or losses, income taxes and corporate expenses. However, operating profit of the financial services segment includes the effect of interest expense and foreign currency exchange gains or losses.
Worldwide Agriculture and Turf Operations The agriculture and turf segment had an operating profit of $3,921 million in 2012, compared with $3,447 million in 2011. Net sales increased 13 percent this year primarily due to higher shipment volumes and improved price realization, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to higher shipment volumes and price realization, partially offset by increased production and raw material costs, unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange, increased research and development expenses and higher selling, administrative and general expenses. The increase in production costs was primarily related to new products, engine emission requirements and incentive compensation expenses.
Worldwide Construction and Forestry Operations The construction and forestry segment had an operating profit of $476 million in 2012, compared with $392 million in 2011. Net sales increased 19 percent for the year primarily due to higher shipment volumes and improved price realization. The operating profit improvement in 2012 was primarily due to price realization and higher shipment volumes, partially offset by increased production and raw material costs, increased research and development expenses and higher selling, administrative and general expenses. The increase in production costs was primarily related to new products, engine emission requirements and incentive compensation expenses.
Worldwide Financial Services Operations The operating profit of the financial services segment was $712 million in 2012, compared with $725 million in 2011. The decrease in operating profit was primarily due to increased selling, administrative and general expenses, higher reserves for crop insurance claims and narrower financing spreads, partially offset by growth in the credit portfolio and a lower provision for credit losses. Total revenues of the financial services operations, including intercompany revenues, increased 3 percent in 2012, primarily reflecting the larger portfolio. The average balance of receivables and leases financed was 10 percent higher in 2012, compared with 2011. Interest expense decreased 4 percent in 2012 as a result of lower average borrowing rates, partially offset by higher average borrowings. The financial services operations ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 2.25 to 1 in 2012, compared with 2.22 to 1 in 2011.
Equipment Operations in U.S. and Canada The equipment operations in the U.S. and Canada had an operating profit of $3,836 million in 2012, compared with $2,898 million in 2011. The increase was due to higher shipment volumes and improved price realization, partially offset by increased production and raw material costs, increased research and development expenses and higher selling, administrative and general expenses. Net sales increased 20 percent primarily due to higher shipment volumes and price realization. The physical volume of sales increased 14 percent, compared with 2011.
22 Table of Contents Equipment Operations outside U.S. and Canada The equipment operations outside the U.S. and Canada had an operating profit of $561 million in 2012, compared with $941 million in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to higher production and raw material costs, the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange, increased selling, administrative and general expenses and higher research and development expenses, partially offset by the effects of higher shipment volumes and improved price realization. Net sales were 5 percent higher primarily reflecting increased shipment volumes and price realization, partially offset by the effect of foreign currency translation. The physical volume of sales increased 7 percent, compared with 2011.
MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK Company equipment sales are projected to increase by about 5 percent for fiscal year 2013 and about 10 percent for the first quarter, compared with the same periods of 2012. For fiscal year 2013, net income attributable to Deere& Company is anticipated to be approximately $3.2 billion.
Agriculture and Turf.
The companys worldwide sales of agriculture and turf equipment are forecast to increase by about 4 percent for fiscal year 2013. Relatively high commodity prices and strong farm incomes are expected to continue supporting a favorable level of demand for farm machinery during the year. The companys sales are expected to benefit from global expansion and lines of advanced new equipment.
Industry sales for agricultural machinery in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be about the same for 2013 in relation to the prior years healthy levels. Caution around the U.S. livestock and dairy sectors is expected to offset continued strength in demand for large equipment, such as high horsepower tractors.
Fiscal year industry sales in the EU27 are forecast to be about the same to 5 percent lower due to continuing deterioration in the overall economy and a poor harvest in the U.K. Sales in the Commonwealth of Independent States are expected to be modestly higher in 2013. In South America, industry sales are projected to increase about 10 percent as a result of favorable commodity prices and increased planting intentions. Industry sales in Asia are projected to be approximately the same as 2012 due to softer economic conditions in India and China.
U.S. and Canada industry sales of turf and utility equipment are expected to increase about 5 percent for 2013, reflecting some improvement in the U.S. economy. The companys sales are expected to increase more than the industry due to the impact of new products.
Construction and Forestry.
The companys worldwide sales of construction and forestry equipment are forecast to increase by about 8 percent for fiscal year 2013 due in part to modest improvement in U.S. economic conditions. Sales in world forestry markets are projected to be about the same for the year as further weakness in European markets offsets stronger demand in the U.S.
Financial Services.
Fiscal year 2013 net income attributable to Deere& Company for the financial services operations is expected to be approximately $500 million. The forecast improvement is primarily due to expected growth in the credit portfolio and lower crop insurance claims. These factors are projected to be partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses, which is anticipated to return to a more typical level.
SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Statements under Overview, Market Conditions and Outlook, and other forward-looking statements herein that relate to future events, expectations, trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change, and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all of the companys businesses.
The companys agricultural equipment business is subject to a number of uncertainties including the many interrelated factors that affect farmers confidence. These factors include worldwide economic conditions, demand for agricultural products, world grain stocks, weather conditions (including its effects on timely planting and harvesting), soil conditions (including low subsoil moisture from recent drought conditions), harvest yields, prices for commodities and livestock, crop and livestock production expenses, availability of transport for crops, the growth of non-food uses for some crops (including ethanol and biodiesel production), real estate values, available acreage for farming, the land ownership policies of various governments, changes in government farm programs and policies (including those in Argentina, Brazil, China, the European Union,India, Russia and the U.S.), international reaction to such programs, changes in and effects of crop insurance programs, global trade agreements, animal diseases and their effects on poultry, beef and pork consumption and prices, crop pests and diseases, and the level of farm product exports (including concerns about genetically modified organisms).
Factors affecting the outlook for the companys turf and utility equipment include general economic conditions, consumer confidence, weather conditions, customer profitability, consumer borrowing patterns, consumer purchasing preferences, housing starts, infrastructure investment, spending by municipalities and golf courses, and consumable input costs.
23 Table of Contents General economic conditions, consumer spending patterns, real estate and housing prices, the number of housing starts and interest rates are especially important to sales of the companys construction and forestry equipment. The levels of public and non-residential construction also impact the results of the companys construction and forestry segment. Prices for pulp, paper, lumber and structural panels are important to sales of forestry equipment.
All of the companys businesses and its reported results are affected by general economic conditions in the global markets in which the company operates, especially material changes in economic activity in these markets; customer confidence in general economic conditions; foreign currency exchange rates and their volatility, especially fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar; interest rates; and inflation and deflation rates. General economic conditions can affect demand for the companys equipment as well. Uncertainty about and actual government spending and taxing could adversely affect the economy, employment, consumer and corporate spending, and company results.
Customer and company operations and results could be affected by changes in weather patterns (including the effects of drought conditions in parts of the U.S. and dryer than normal conditions in certain other markets); the political and social stability of the global markets in which the company operates; the effects of, or response to, terrorism and security threats; wars and other conflicts and the threat thereof; and the spread of major epidemics.
Significant changes in market liquidity conditions and any failure to comply with financial covenants in credit agreements could impact access to funding and funding costs, which could reduce the companys earnings and cash flows. Financial market conditions could also negatively impact customer access to capital for purchases of the companys products and customer confidence and purchase decisions; borrowing and repayment practices; and the number and size of customer loan delinquencies and defaults. The sovereign debt crisis, in Europe or elsewhere, could negatively impact currencies, global financial markets, social and political stability, funding sources and costs, asset and obligation values, customers, suppliers, and company operations and results. State debt crises also could negatively impact customers, suppliers, demand for equipment, and company operations and results. The companys investment management activities could be impaired by changes in the equity and bond markets, which would negatively affect earnings.
Additional factors that could materially affect the companys operations, access to capital, expenses and results include changes in and the impact of governmental trade, banking, monetary and fiscal policies, including financial regulatory reform and its effects on the consumer finance industry, derivatives, funding costs and other areas, and governmental programs, policies and tariffs in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of certain industries or sectors (including protectionist and expropriation policies and trade and licensing restrictions that could disrupt international commerce); actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and other central banks; actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other financial regulators; actions by environmental, health and safety regulatory agencies, including those related to engine emissions (in particular Interim Tier 4, Final Tier 4 and Stage IIIb non-road diesel emission requirements), carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, noise and the risk of climate change; changes in labor regulations; changes to accounting standards; changes in tax rates, estimates, and regulations; compliance with U.S. and foreign laws when expanding to new markets; and actions by other regulatory bodies including changes in laws and regulations affecting the sectors in which the company operates. Customer and company operations and results also could be affected by changes to GPS radio frequency bands or their permitted uses.
Other factors that could materially affect results include production, design and technological innovations and difficulties, including capacity and supply constraints and prices; the availability and prices of strategically sourced materials, components and whole goods; delays or disruptions in the companys supply chain or the loss of liquidity by suppliers; the failure of suppliers to comply with laws, regulations and company policy pertaining to employment, human rights, health, safety, the environment and other ethical business practices; start-up of new plants and new products; the success of new product initiatives and customer acceptance of new products; changes in customer product preferences and sales mix whether as a result of changes in equipment design to meet government regulations or for other reasons; gaps or limitations in rural broadband coverage, capacity and speed needed to support technology solutions; oil and energy prices and supplies; the availability and cost of freight; actions of competitors in the various industries in which the company competes, particularly price discounting; dealer practices especially as to levels of new and used field inventories; labor relations; acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, the integration of new businesses; the implementation of organizational changes; difficulties related to the conversion and implementation of enterprise resource planning systems that disrupt business, negatively impact supply or distribution relationships or create higher than expected costs; security breaches and other disruptions to the companys information technology infrastructure; changes in company declared dividends and common stock issuances and repurchases.
Company results are also affected by changes in the level and funding of employee retirement benefits, changes in market values of investment assets and the level of interest rates, which impact retirement benefit costs, and significant changes in health care costs including those which may result from governmental action.
The liquidity and ongoing profitability of John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation) and other credit subsidiaries depend largely on timely access to capital to meet future cash flow requirements and fund operations and the costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities and to fund purchases of the companys products. If market uncertainty increases and general economic conditions worsen, funding 24 Table of Contents could be unavailable or insufficient. Additionally, customer confidence levels may result in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact write-offs and provisions for credit losses. The failure of reinsurers of the companys insurance business also could materially affect results.
The companys outlook is based upon assumptions relating to the factors described above, which are sometimes based upon estimates and data prepared by government agencies. Such estimates and data are often revised. The company, except as required by law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise its outlook, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. Further information concerning the company and its businesses, including factors that potentially could materially affect the companys financial results, is included in other filings with the SEC.
2011 COMPARED WITH 2010 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Worldwide net income attributable to Deere& Company in 2011 was $2,800 million, or $6.63 per share diluted ($6.71 basic), compared with $1,865 million, or $4.35 per share diluted ($4.40 basic), in 2010. Net sales and revenues increased 23 percent to $32,013 million in 2011, compared with $26,005 million in 2010. Net sales of the equipment operations increased 25 percent in 2011 to $29,466 million from $23,573 million in 2010. The sales increase, which was primarily due to higher shipment volumes, also included a favorable effect for foreign currency translation of 3 percent and price realization of 3 percent. Net sales in the U.S. and Canada increased 17 percent in 2011. Net sales outside the U.S. and Canada increased by 38 percent in 2011, which included a favorable effect of 7 percent for foreign currency translation.
Worldwide equipment operations had an operating profit of $3,839 million in 2011, compared with $2,909 million in 2010. The higher operating profit was primarily due to higher shipment volumes and improved price realization, partially offset by increased raw material costs, higher manufacturing overhead costs related to new products, higher selling, administrative and general expenses and increased research and development expenses.
The equipment operations net income was $2,329 million in 2011, compared with $1,492 million in 2010. The same operating factors mentioned above and a lower effective tax rate in 2011 affected these results.
Net income of the financial services operations attributable to Deere& Company in 2011 increased to $471 million, compared with $373 million in 2010. The increase was primarily a result of growth in the credit portfolio and a lower provision for credit losses. Additional information is presented in the following discussion of the Worldwide Financial Services Operations.
The cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2011 was 74.4 percent, compared with 73.8 percent in 2010. The increase was primarily due to increased raw material costs and higher manufacturing overhead costs related to new products, partially offset by improved price realization.
Finance and interest income increased in 2011 due to a larger average credit portfolio, partially offset by lower financing rates. Other income increased in 2011 primarily as a result of higher insurance premiums and fees earned on crop insurance, largely offset by lower service revenues due to the sale of the wind energy business (see Note 4). Research and development expenses increased primarily as a result of increased spending in support of new products and more stringent emission requirements. Selling, administrative and general expenses increased primarily due to growth and higher sales commissions. Interest expense decreased due to lower average borrowing rates, partially offset by higher average borrowings. Other operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower depreciation expenses in 2011 due to the sale of the wind energy business and the write-down of the related assets held for sale at the end of 2010, partially offset by higher crop insurance claims and expenses in 2011. The effective tax rate for the provision for income taxes was lower in 2011 primarily due to the effect of the tax expense related to the enactment of health care legislation in 2010 (see Note 8).
The company has several defined benefit pension plans and defined benefit health care and life insurance plans. The companys postretirement benefit costs for these plans in 2011 were $603 million, compared with $658 million in 2010. The long-term expected return on plan assets, which is reflected in these costs, was an expected gain of 8.0 percent in 2011 and 8.2 percent in 2010, or $906 million in 2011 and $883 million in 2010. The actual return was a gain of $695 million in 2011 and $1,273 million in 2010. Total company contributions to the plans were $122 million in 2011 and $836 million in 2010, which include direct benefit payments for unfunded plans. These contributions also included voluntary contributions to plan assets of $650 million in 2010.
BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS Worldwide Agriculture and Turf Operations The agriculture and turf segment had an operating profit of $3,447 million in 2011, compared with $2,790 million in 2010. Net sales increased 21 percent in 2011 primarily due to higher shipment volumes. Sales also increased due to improved price realization and foreign currency translation. The increase in operating profit was largely due to increased shipment volumes and improved price realization, partially offset by increased raw material costs, higher manufacturing overhead costs related to new products, higher selling, administrative and general expenses and increased research and development expenses.
Worldwide Construction and Forestry Operations The construction and forestry segment had an operating profit of $392 million in 2011, compared with $119 million in 2010. Net sales increased 45 percent in 2011 primarily due to higher shipment volumes. Sales also increased due to improved price realization. The operating profit improvement in 2011 was primarily due to higher shipment and production volumes and improved price realization, partially offset by increased raw material costs, higher selling, administrative and general expenses and increased research and development expenses.
25 Table of Contents Worldwide Financial Services Operations The operating profit of the financial services segment was $725 million in 2011, compared with $499 million in 2010. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to growth in the credit portfolio and a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by narrower financing spreads. Results in 2010 were also affected by the write-down of wind energy assets that were held for sale (see Note 4). Total revenues of the financial services operations, including intercompany revenues, increased 3 percent in 2011, primarily reflecting the larger portfolio. The average balance of receivables and leases financed was 13 percent higher in 2011, compared with 2010. Interest expense decreased 7 percent in 2011 as a result of lower average borrowing rates, partially offset by higher average borrowings. The financial services operations ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 2.22 to 1 in 2011, compared with 1.77 to 1 in 2010.
Equipment Operations in U.S. and Canada The equipment operations in the U.S. and Canada had an operating profit of $2,898 million in 2011, compared with $2,302 million in 2010. The increase was due to higher shipment volumes and improved price realization, partially offset by increased raw material costs, higher manufacturing overhead costs related to new products, increased selling, administrative and general expenses and higher research and development expenses. Net sales increased 17 percent primarily due to higher shipment volumes and improved price realization. The physical volume of sales increased 12 percent, compared with 2010.
Equipment Operations outside U.S. and Canada The equipment operations outside the U.S. and Canada had an operating profit of $941 million in 2011, compared with $607 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to the effects of higher shipment volumes and improved price realization, partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher manufacturing overhead costs related to new products, increased selling, administrative and general expenses and higher research and development costs. Net sales were 38 percent higher primarily reflecting increased volumes and the effect of foreign currency translation. The physical volume of sales increased 30 percent, compared with 2010.
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY The discussion of capital resources and liquidity has been organized to review separately, where appropriate, the companys consolidated totals, equipment operations and financial services operations.
CONSOLIDATED Positive cash flows from consolidated operating activities in 2012 were $1,168 million. This resulted primarily from net income adjusted for non-cash provisions and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, which were partially offset by an increase in trade receivables, inventories and insurance receivables. Cash outflows from investing activities were $4,004 million in 2012, primarily due to the cost of receivables (excluding receivables related to sales) and equipment on operating leases exceeding the collections of receivables and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by $2,076 million, purchases of property and equipment of $1,319 million and purchases exceeding maturities and sales of marketable securities by $682 million. Cash inflows from financing activities were $3,880 million in 2012 primarily due to an increase in borrowings of $6,141 million, partially offset by repurchases of common stock of $1,588 million and dividends paid of $698 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased $1,005 million during 2012.
Over the last three years, operating activities have provided an aggregate of $5,776 million in cash. In addition, increases in borrowings were $8,050 million, proceeds from sales of businesses were $976 million, proceeds from issuance of common stock (resulting from the exercise of stock options) were $360 million. The aggregate amount of these cash flows was used mainly to acquire receivables (excluding receivables related to sales) and equipment on operating leases that exceeded collections of receivables and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by $5,199 million, repurchase common stock of $3,614 million, purchase property and equipment of $3,138 million, pay dividends of $1,775 million and purchase marketable securities that exceeded proceeds from maturities and sales by $1,261 million. Cash and cash equivalents remained approximately the same as three years ago.
Given the continued uncertainty in the global economy, there has been a reduction in liquidity in some global markets that continues to affect the funding activities of the company. However, the company has access to most global markets at a reasonable cost and expects to have sufficient sources of global funding and liquidity to meet its funding needs. The companys exposures to receivables from customers in European countries experiencing economic strains are not significant. Sources of liquidity for the company include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, funds from operations, the issuance of commercial paper and term debt, the securitization of retail notes (both public and private markets) and committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit. The companys commercial paper outstanding at October31, 2012 and 2011 was $1,207 million and $1,279 million, respectively, while the total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities position was $6,123 million and $4,435 million, respectively. The amount of the total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries, in which earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested, was $628 million and $720 million at October31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
26 Table of Contents Lines of Credit.
The company also has access to bank lines of credit with various banks throughout the world. Worldwide lines of credit totaled $5,194 million at October31, 2012, $3,793 million of which were unused. For the purpose of computing unused credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings, excluding secured borrowings and the current portion of long-term borrowings, were primarily considered to constitute utilization. Included in the total credit lines at October31, 2012 was a long-term credit facility agreement of $2,750 million, expiring in April2015, and a long-term credit facility agreement of $1,500 million, expiring in April2017. These credit agreements require Capital Corporation to maintain its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter and the ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to capital base (total subordinated debt and stockholders equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than 11 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. The credit agreements also require the equipment operations to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capital (total debt and stockholders equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) of 65 percent or less at the end of each fiscal quarter. Under this provision, the companys excess equity capacity and retained earnings balance free of restriction at October31, 2012 was $8,273 million. Alternatively under this provision, the equipment operations had the capacity to incur additional debt of $15,364 million at October31, 2012. All of these requirements of the credit agreements have been met during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.
Debt Ratings.
To access public debt capital markets, the company relies on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to the companys securities as an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors. A security rating is not a recommendation by the rating agency to buy, sell or hold company securities. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw company ratings based on its assessment of the companys current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Each agencys rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs, including costs of derivative transactions, and reduced access to debt capital markets. The senior long-term and short-term debt ratings and outlook currently assigned to unsecured company securities by the rating agencies engaged by the company are as follows: Senior Long-Term Short-Term Outlook Moodys Investors Service,Inc.
A2 Prime-1 Stable Standard& Poors A A-1 Stable Trade accounts and notes receivable primarily arise from sales of goods to independent dealers. Trade receivables increased by $505 million in 2012 primarily resulting from the increase in sales, partially offset by the effect of foreign currency translation. The ratio of trade accounts and notes receivable at October31 to fiscal year net sales was 11 percent in 2012 and 2011. Total worldwide agriculture and turf receivables increased $456 million and construction and forestry receivables increased $49 million. The collection period for trade receivables averages less than 12 months. The percentage of trade receivables outstanding for a period exceeding 12 months was 2 percent and 3 percent at October31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Deere& Companys stockholders equity was $6,842 million at October31, 2012, compared with $6,800 million at October31, 2011. The increase of $42 million resulted primarily from net income attributable to Deere& Company of $3,065 million and an increase in common stock of $100 million, which were partially offset by an increase in treasury stock of $1,521 million, dividends declared of $709 million, a change in the retirement benefits adjustment of $624 million and a change in the cumulative translation adjustment of $270 million.
EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS The companys equipment businesses are capital intensive and are subject to seasonal variations in financing requirements for inventories and certain receivables from dealers. The equipment operations sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to financial services. To the extent necessary, funds provided from operations are supplemented by external financing sources.
Cash provided by operating activities of the equipment operations during 2012, including intercompany cash flows, was $2,948 million primarily due to net income adjusted for non-cash provisions and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by an increase in inventories and trade receivables.
Over the last three years, these operating activities, including intercompany cash flows, have provided an aggregate of $8,491 million in cash.
Trade receivables held by the equipment operations increased by $186 million during 2012. The equipment operations sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to financial services (see previous consolidated discussion).
Inventories increased by $799 million in 2012 primarily reflecting the increase in production and sales, partially offset by the effect of foreign currency translation. Most of these inventories are valued on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The ratios of inventories on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis (see Note 15), which approximates current cost, to fiscal year cost of sales were 26 percent and 27 percent at October31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Total interest-bearing debt of the equipment operations was $5,870 million at the end of 2012, compared with $3,696 million at the end of 2011 and $3,414 million at the end of 2010. The ratio of total debt to total capital (total interest-bearing debt and stockholders equity) at the end of 2012, 2011 and 2010 was 46 percent, 35 percent and 35 percent, respectively.
27 Table of Contents Property and equipment cash expenditures for the equipment operations in 2012 were $1,316 million, compared with $1,054 million in 2011. Capital expenditures in 2013 are estimated to be $1,300 million.
FINANCIAL SERVICES The financial services operations rely on their ability to raise substantial amounts of funds to finance their receivable and lease portfolios. Their primary sources of funds for this purpose are a combination of commercial paper, term debt, securitization of retail notes, equity capital and from time to time borrowings from Deere& Company.
The cash provided by operating activities and financing activities was used primarily for investing activities. Cash flows from the financial services operating activities, including intercompany cash flows, were $877 million in 2012. Cash used by investing activities totaled $4,635 million in 2012, primarily due to the cost of receivables (excluding trade and wholesale) and cost of equipment on operating leases exceeding collections of these receivables and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by $3,172 million and an increase in trade receivables and wholesale notes of $1,519 million. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $4,017 million in 2012, representing primarily an increase in external borrowings of $3,876 million and capital investment from Deere& Company of $264 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased $285 million.
Over the last three years, the operating activities, including intercompany cash flows, have provided $3,217 million in cash. In addition, an increase in total borrowings of $7,368 million and capital investment from Deere& Company of $377 million provided cash inflows. These amounts have been used mainly to fund receivables (excluding trade and wholesale) and equipment on operating lease acquisitions, which exceeded collections and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by $7,622 million, fund an increase in trade receivables and wholesale notes of $2,919 million and pay dividends to Deere& Company of $601 million. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $218 million over the three-year period.
Receivables and equipment on operating leases increased by $3,855 million in 2012, compared with 2011. Total acquisition volumes of receivables (excluding trade and wholesale notes) and cost of equipment on operating leases increased 10 percent in 2012, compared with 2011. The volumes of operating leases, financing leases, retail notes and revolving charge accounts increased approximately 27 percent, 16 percent, 14 percent, and 5 percent, respectively, while operating loans decreased 95 percent due to lower market coverage. The amount of wholesale notes increased 31 percent and trade receivables increased 16 percent during 2012. At October31, 2012 and 2011, net receivables and leases administered, which include receivables administered but not owned, were $31,746 million and $27,918 million, respectively.
Total external interest-bearing debt of the financial services operations was $26,551 million at the end of 2012, compared with $22,894 million at the end of 2011 and $20,935 million at the end of 2010. Total external borrowings have changed generally corresponding with the level of the receivable and lease portfolio, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in payables owed to Deere& Company and the change in investment from Deere& Company. The financial services operations ratio of total interest-bearing debt to total stockholders equity was 7.2 to 1 at the end of 2012, 7.5 to 1 at the end of 2011 and 7.1 to 1 at the end of 2010.
The Capital Corporation has a revolving credit agreement to utilize bank conduit facilities to securitize retail notes (see Note 13). At October31, 2012, the facility had a total capacity, or financing limit, of up to $2,750 million of secured financings at any time. The facility was renewed in November2012 with a capacity of $3,000 million. After a three-year revolving period, unless the banks and Capital Corporation agree to renew, Capital Corporation would liquidate the secured borrowings over time as payments on the retail notes are collected. At October31, 2012, $1,314 million of short-term securitization borrowings was outstanding under the agreement.
During 2012, the financial services operations issued $2,775 million and retired $1,978 million of retail note securitization borrowings. During 2012, the financial services operations also issued $8,121 million and retired $5,176 million of long-term borrowings. The long-term borrowing retirements included $1,500 million of 7% Notes due in March2012. The remaining issuances and retirements were primarily medium-term notes.
OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS At October31, 2012, the company had approximately $290 million of guarantees issued primarily to banks outside the U.S. related to third-party receivables for the retail financing of John Deere equipment. The company may recover a portion of any required payments incurred under these agreements from repossession of the equipment collateralizing the receivables. The maximum remaining term of the receivables guaranteed at October31, 2012 was approximately five years.
28 Table of Contents AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The payment schedule for the companys contractual obligations at October31, 2012 in millions of dollars is as follows: Less More than 2&3 4&5 than Total 1year years years 5years On-balance-sheet Debt* Equipment operations $ 5,869 $ 425 $ 1,018 $ 48 $ 4,378 Financial services** 26,039 7,806 9,305 4,673 4,255 Total 31,908 8,231 10,323 4,721 8,633 Interest relating to debt*** 5,353 716 1,046 752 2,839 Accounts payable 3,312 3,184 86 38 4 Capital leases 57 28 21 4 4 Off-balance-sheet Purchase obligations 4,299 4,251 38 10 Operating leases 462 148 182 75 57 Total $ 45,391 $ 16,558 $ 11,696 $ 5,600 $ 11,537 * Principal payments.
** Securitization borrowings of $3,575 million classified as short-term on the balance sheet related to the securitization of retail notes are included in this table based on the expected payment schedule (see Note 18).
*** Includes projected payments related to interest rate swaps.
The previous table does not include unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of approximately $265 million at October31, 2012 since the timing of future payments is not reasonably estimable at this time (see Note 8). For additional information regarding pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations, short-term borrowings, long-term borrowings and lease obligations, see Notes 7, 18, 20 and 21, respectively.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on the financial statements. The accounting policies below are those management believes are the most critical to the preparation of the companys financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The companys other accounting policies are described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Sales Incentives At the time a sale to a dealer is recognized, the company records an estimate of the future sales incentive costs for allowances and financing programs that will be due when the dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. The estimate is based on historical data, announced incentive programs, field inventory levels and retail sales volumes. The final cost of these programs and the amount of accrual required for a specific sale are fully determined when the dealer sells the equipment to the retail customer. This is due to numerous programs available at any particular time and new programs that may be announced after the company records the sale. Changes in the mix and types of programs affect these estimates, which are reviewed quarterly.
The sales incentive accruals at October31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $1,453 million, $1,122 million and $879 million, respectively. The increases in 2012 and 2011 were primarily due to higher sales volumes.
The estimation of the sales incentive accrual is impacted by many assumptions. One of the key assumptions is the historical percent of sales incentive costs to retail sales from dealers. Over the last five fiscal years, this percent has varied by an average of approximately plus or minus .7 percent, compared to the average sales incentive costs to retail sales percent during that period. Holding other assumptions constant, if this estimated cost experience percent were to increase or decrease .7 percent, the sales incentive accrual at October31, 2012 would increase or decrease by approximately $50 million.
Product Warranties At the time a sale to a dealer is recognized, the company records the estimated future warranty costs. The company generally determines its total warranty liability by applying historical claims rate experience to the estimated amount of equipment that has been sold and is still under warranty based on dealer inventories and retail sales. The historical claims rate is primarily determined by a review of five-year claims costs and consideration of current quality developments. Variances in claims experience and the type of warranty programs affect these estimates, which are reviewed quarterly.
The product warranty accruals, excluding extended warranty unamortized premiums, at October31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $733 million, $662 million and $559 million, respectively. The changes were primarily due to higher sales volumes in 2012 and 2011.
Estimates used to determine the product warranty accruals are significantly affected by the historical percent of warranty claims costs to sales. Over the last five fiscal years, this percent has varied by an average of approximately plus or minus .09 percent, compared to the average warranty costs to sales percent during that period. Holding other assumptions constant, if this estimated cost experience percent were to increase or decrease .09 percent, the warranty accrual at October31, 2012 would increase or decrease by approximately $35 million.
Postretirement Benefit Obligations Pension obligations and other postretirement employee benefit (OPEB) obligations are based on various assumptions used by the companys actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in assumptions affect future expenses and obligations.
29 Table of Contents The pension liabilities, net of pension assets, recognized on the balance sheet at October31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $1,817 million, $1,373 million and $693 million, respectively. The OPEB liabilities, net of OPEB assets, on these same dates were $5,736 million, $5,193 million and $4,830 million, respectively. The increases in pension net liabilities in 2012 and 2011 were primarily due to decreases in discount rates and interest on the liabilities, partially offset by the return on plan assets. The increases in the OPEB net liabilities in 2012 and 2011 were primarily due to the decreases in discount rates and interest on the liabilities.
The effect of hypothetical changes to selected assumptions on the companys major U.S. retirement benefit plans would be as follows in millions of dollars: October31,2012 2013 Increase Increase Percentage (Decrease) (Decrease) Assumptions Change PBO/APBO* Expense Pension Discount rate** +/-.5 $ (598)/635 $ (28)/28 Expected return on assets +/-.5 (45)/45 OPEB Discount rate** +/-.5 (419)/465 (24)/26 Expected return on assets +/-.5 (6)/6 Health care cost trend rate** +/-1.0 938/(709) 124/(95) * Projected benefit obligation (PBO) for pension plans and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) for OPEB plans.
** Pretax impact on service cost, interest cost and amortization of gains or losses.
Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment annually and when events or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is reduced below its carrying amount. The end of the third quarter is the annual measurement date. To test for goodwill impairment, the carrying value of each reporting unit is compared with its fair value. If the carrying value of the goodwill is considered impaired, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill.
An estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit is determined through a combination of comparable market values for similar businesses and discounted cash flows. These estimates can change significantly based on such factors as the reporting units financial performance, economic conditions, interest rates, growth rates, pricing, changes in business strategies and competition.
Based on this testing, the company identified a reporting unit in 2012 and 2010 for which the goodwill was impaired. In the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2010, the company recorded non-cash charges in cost of sales of $33 million pretax, or $31 million after-tax, and $27 million pretax, or $25 million after-tax, respectively. The charges were associated with a reporting unit included in the agriculture and turf operating segment. The key factor contributing to the impairments was a decline in the reporting units forecasted financial performance (see Note 5).
A 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of the companys other reporting units would have had no impact on the carrying value of goodwill at the annual measurement date in 2012.
Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses represents an estimate of the losses expected from the companys receivable portfolio. The level of the allowance is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including historical loss experience by product category, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic conditions and credit risk quality. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly. Different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses.
The total allowance for credit losses at October31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $243 million, $269 million and $296 million, respectively. The decreases in 2012 and 2011 were primarily due to decreases in loss experience.
The assumptions used in evaluating the companys exposure to credit losses involve estimates and significant judgment. The historical loss experience on the receivable portfolio represents one of the key assumptions involved in determining the allowance for credit losses. Over the last five fiscal years, this percent has varied by an average of approximately plus or minus .23 percent, compared to the average loss experience percent during that period. Holding other assumptions constant, if this estimated loss experience on the receivable portfolio were to increase or decrease .23 percent, the allowance for credit losses at October31, 2012 would increase or decrease by approximately $70 million.
Operating Lease Residual Values The carrying value of equipment on operating leases is affected by the estimated fair values of the equipment at the end of the lease (residual values). Upon termination of the lease, the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third party, in which case the company may record a gain or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sales price. The residual values are dependent on current economic conditions and are reviewed quarterly. Changes in residual value assumptions would affect the amount of depreciation expense and the amount of investment in equipment on operating leases.
The total operating lease residual values at October31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $1,676 million, $1,425 million and $1,276 million, respectively. The changes in 2012 and 2011 were primarily due to the increasing levels of operating leases.
30 Table of Contents Estimates used in determining end of lease market values for equipment on operating leases significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense. If future market values for this equipment were to decrease 10 percent from the companys present estimates, the total impact would be to increase the companys annual depreciation for equipment on operating leases by approximately $70 million.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MARKET RISK INFORMATION The company is naturally exposed to various interest rate and foreign currency risks. As a result, the company enters into derivative transactions to manage certain of these exposures that arise in the normal course of business and not for the purpose of creating speculative positions or trading. The companys financial services manage the relationship of the types and amounts of their funding sources to their receivable and lease portfolio in an effort to diminish risk due to interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, while responding to favorable financing opportunities. Accordingly, from time to time, these operations enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage their interest rate exposure. The company also has foreign currency exposures at some of its foreign and domestic operations related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies. The company has entered into agreements related to the management of these foreign currency transaction risks.
Interest Rate Risk Quarterly, the company uses a combination of cash flow models to assess the sensitivity of its financial instruments with interest rate exposure to changes in market interest rates. The models calculate the effect of adjusting interest rates as follows. Cash flows for financing receivables are discounted at the current prevailing rate for each receivable portfolio. Cash flows for marketable securities are primarily discounted at the applicable benchmark yield curve plus market credit spreads. Cash flows for unsecured borrowings are discounted at the applicable benchmark yield curve plus market credit spreads for similarly rated borrowers. Cash flows for securitized borrowings are discounted at the swap yield curve plus a market credit spread for similarly rated borrowers. Cash flows for interest rate swaps are projected and discounted using forward rates from the swap yield curve at the repricing dates. The net loss in these financial instruments fair values which would be caused by decreasing the interest rates by 10 percent from the market rates at October31, 2012 would have been approximately $33 million. The net loss from increasing the interest rates by 10 percent at October31, 2011 would have been approximately $42 million.
Foreign Currency Risk In the equipment operations, the companys practice is to hedge significant currency exposures. Worldwide foreign currency exposures are reviewed quarterly. Based on the equipment operations anticipated and committed foreign currency cash inflows, outflows and hedging policy for the next twelve months, the company estimates that a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies through 2013 would decrease the 2013 expected net cash inflows by $68 million. At October31, 2011, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar under similar assumptions and calculations indicated a potential $19 million adverse effect on the 2012 net cash inflows.
In the financial services operations, the companys policy is to hedge the foreign currency risk if the currency of the borrowings does not match the currency of the receivable portfolio. As a result, a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the financial services cash flows.

35 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION AND CONSOLIDATION Structure of Operations The information in the notes and related commentary are presented in a format which includes data grouped as follows: Equipment Operations Includes the companys agriculture and turf operations and construction and forestry operations with financial services reflected on the equity basis.
Financial Services Includes primarily the companys financing operations.
Consolidated Represents the consolidation of the equipment operations and financial services. References to Deere& Company or the company refer to the entire enterprise.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements represent primarily the consolidation of all companies in which Deere& Company has a controlling interest. Certain variable interest entities (VIEs) are consolidated since the company has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. Deere& Company records its investment in each unconsolidated affiliated company (generally 20 to 50 percent ownership) at its related equity in the net assets of such affiliate (see Note 10). Other investments (less than 20 percent ownership) are recorded at cost.
Variable Interest Entities The company is the primary beneficiary of and consolidates a VIE based on a cost sharing supply contract. The company has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. No additional support beyond what was previously contractually required has been provided during any periods presented. The VIE produces blended fertilizer and other lawn care products for the agriculture and turf segment.
The assets and liabilities of this supplier VIE consisted of the following at October31 in millions of dollars: 2012 2011 Cash and cash equivalents $ 26 $ 11 Intercompany receivables 7 14 Inventories 25 30 Property and equipment  net 2 3 Other assets 5 3 Total assets $ 65 $ 61 Short-term borrowings $ 5 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 48 $ 56 Total liabilities $ 53 $ 56 The VIE is financed primarily through its own liabilities. The assets of the VIE can only be used to settle the obligations of the VIE. The creditors of the VIE do not have recourse to the general credit of the company.
See Note 13 for VIEs related to securitization of financing receivables.
Reclassification Certain items previously reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows have been reclassified to conform to the 2012 presentation. In the operating activities, insurance receivables were separately stated from other adjustments to net income (see Note 12). The same change was made in the Supplemental Consolidating Data in Note 31, statement of cash flows for financial services. The total cash flows for the consolidated and financial services net cash provided by operating activities did not change.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following are significant accounting policies in addition to those included in other notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Use of Estimates in Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition Sales of equipment and service parts are recorded when the sales price is determinable and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to independent parties based on the sales agreements in effect. In the U.S. and most international locations, this transfer occurs primarily when goods are shipped. In Canada and some other international locations, certain goods are shipped to dealers on a consignment basis under which the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the dealer. Accordingly, in these locations, sales are not recorded until a retail customer has purchased the goods. In all cases, when a sale is recorded by the company, no significant uncertainty exists surrounding the purchasers obligation to pay. No right of return exists on sales of equipment. Service parts and certain attachments returns are estimable and accrued at the time a sale is recognized. The company makes appropriate provisions based on experience for costs such as doubtful receivables, sales incentives and product warranty.
Financing revenue is recorded over the lives of related receivables using the interest method. Insurance premiums recorded in other income are generally recognized in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred over the contract period. Deferred costs on the origination of financing receivables are recognized as a reduction in finance revenue over the expected lives of the receivables using the interest method. Income and deferred costs on the origination of operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the scheduled lease terms in finance revenue.
Sales Incentives At the time a sale is recognized, the company records an estimate of the future sales incentive costs for allowances and financing programs that will be due when a dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. The estimate is based on historical data, announced incentive programs, field inventory levels and retail sales volumes.
36 Table of Contents Product Warranties At the time a sale is recognized, the company records the estimated future warranty costs. These costs are usually estimated based on historical warranty claims (see Note 22).
Sales Taxes The company collects and remits taxes assessed by different governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with revenue producing transactions between the company and its customers. These taxes may include sales, use, value-added and some excise taxes. The company reports the collection of these taxes on a net basis (excluded from revenues).
Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs related to the sales of the companys equipment are included in cost of sales.
Advertising Costs Advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred. This expense was $177 million in 2012, $163 million in 2011 and $154 million in 2010.
Depreciation and Amortization Property and equipment, capitalized software and other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. These assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives generally using the straight-line method. Equipment on operating leases is depreciated over the terms of the leases using the straight-line method. Property and equipment expenditures for new and revised products, increased capacity and the replacement or major renewal of significant items are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are generally charged to expense as incurred.
Securitization of Receivables Certain financing receivables are periodically transferred to special purpose entities (SPEs) in securitization transactions (see Note 13). These securitizations qualify as collateral for secured borrowings and no gains or losses are recognized at the time of securitization. The receivables remain on the balance sheet and are classified as Financing receivables securitized - net. The company recognizes finance income over the lives of these receivables using the interest method.
Receivables and Allowances All financing and trade receivables are reported on the balance sheet at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs, the allowance for credit losses and doubtful accounts, and any deferred fees or costs on originated financing receivables. Allowances for credit losses and doubtful accounts are maintained in amounts considered to be appropriate in relation to the receivables outstanding based on collection experience, economic conditions and credit risk quality. Receivables are written-off to the allowance when the account is considered uncollectible.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets (including property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) when events or circumstances warrant such a review. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually at the end of the third fiscal quarter each year, or more often if events or circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value below the carrying value. Goodwill is allocated and reviewed for impairment by reporting units, which consist primarily of the operating segments and certain other reporting units. The goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides. To test for goodwill impairment, the carrying value of each reporting unit is compared with its fair value. If the carrying value of the goodwill or long-lived asset is considered impaired, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset (see Note 5).
Derivative Financial Instruments It is the companys policy that derivative transactions are executed only to manage exposures arising in the normal course of business and not for the purpose of creating speculative positions or trading. The companys financial services manage the relationship of the types and amounts of their funding sources to their receivable and lease portfolio in an effort to diminish risk due to interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, while responding to favorable financing opportunities. The company also has foreign currency exposures at some of its foreign and domestic operations related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies.
All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet. Cash collateral received or paid is not offset against the derivative fair values on the balance sheet. Each derivative is designated as either a cash flow hedge, a fair value hedge, or remains undesignated. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to the income statement when the effects of the item being hedged are recognized in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and effective as fair value hedges are recognized currently in net income. These changes are offset in net income to the extent the hedge was effective by fair value changes related to the risk being hedged on the hedged item. Changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges are recognized currently in the income statement. All ineffective changes in derivative fair values are recognized currently in net income.
All designated hedges are formally documented as to the relationship with the hedged item as well as the risk-management strategy. Both at inception and on an ongoing basis the hedging instrument is assessed as to its effectiveness. If and when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge, or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer likely to occur, or the hedge designation is removed, or the derivative is terminated, the hedge accounting discussed above is discontinued (see Note 27).
Foreign Currency Translation The functional currencies for most of the companys foreign operations are their respective local currencies. The assets and liabilities of these operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the end of the period exchange rates. The revenues and expenses are translated at weighted-average rates for the period. The gains or losses from these translations are recorded in other comprehensive income. Gains or losses from transactions 37 Table of Contents denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary involved and foreign exchange forward contracts are included in net income. The pretax net losses for foreign exchange in 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $96 million, $121 million and $75 million, respectively.
3. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS New Accounting Standards Adopted In the first quarter of 2012, the company adopted the remaining provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.2010-06,Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, which amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. This ASU requires disclosures of transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2, more detailed roll forward reconciliations of Level 3 recurring fair value measurements on a gross basis, fair value information by class of assets and liabilities, and descriptions of valuation techniques and inputs for Level 2 and 3 measurements. The effective date was the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 except for the roll forward reconciliations, which were required in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. The adoption in 2010 and the adoption in the first quarter of 2012 did not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements.
In the second quarter of 2012, the company adopted FASB ASU No.2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs, which amends ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. This ASU requires the categorization by level for items that are required to be disclosed at fair value and information about transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 and additional disclosure for Level 3 measurements. In addition, the ASU provides guidance on measuring the fair value of financial instruments managed within a portfolio and the application of premiums and discounts on fair value measurements. The adoption did not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements.
New Accounting Standards to be Adopted In June2011, the FASB issued ASU No.2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, which amends ASC 220, Comprehensive Income. This ASU requires the presentation of total comprehensive income, total net income and the components of net income and comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. The requirements do not change how earnings per share is calculated or presented. The effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 and must be applied retrospectively. The adoption will not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements.
In September2011, the FASB issued ASU No.2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, which amends ASC 350,Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. This ASU gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine if goodwill is impaired. The entity may first determine based on qualitative factors if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If that assessment indicates no impairment, the first and second steps of the quantitative goodwill impairment test are not required. The effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. The adoption will not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements.
In December2011, the FASB issued ASU No.2011-11, Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, which amends ASC 210, Balance Sheet. This ASU requires entities to disclose gross and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and those subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. This would include derivatives and other financial securities arrangements. The effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 and must be applied retrospectively. The adoption will not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements.
In July2012, the FASB issued ASU No.2012-02, Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment, which amends ASC 350,Intangibles  Goodwill and Other. This ASU gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine if indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. The entity may first determine based on qualitative factors if it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying amount. If that assessment indicates no impairment, the quantitative impairment test is not required. The effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. The adoption will not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements.
4. DISPOSITION In December2010, the company sold John Deere Renewables, LLC, its wind energy business for approximately $900 million. The company had concluded that its resources were best invested in growing its core businesses. These assets were reclassified as held for sale and written down to fair value less cost to sell at October31, 2010 (see Note 26). The asset write-down in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $35 million pretax and included in Other operating expenses.
5. SPECIAL ITEM Goodwill Impairment In the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2010, the company recorded non-cash charges in cost of sales for the impairment of goodwill of $33 million pretax, or $31 million after-tax, and $27 million pretax, or $25 million after-tax, respectively. The charges were associated with the companys John Deere Water reporting unit, which is included in the agriculture and turf operating segment. The goodwill impairments in 2012 and 2010 were due to declines in the forecasted financial performance as a 38 Table of Contents result of more complex integration activities, as well as the global economic downturn prior to 2010. At October31, 2012, the goodwill in this reporting unit has been completely written off.
The method for determining the fair value of the reporting unit to measure the fair value of the goodwill was a discounted cash flow analysis (see Note 26).
6. CASH FLOW INFORMATION For purposes of the statement of consolidated cash flows, the company considers investments with purchased maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Substantially all of the companys short-term borrowings, excluding the current maturities of long-term borrowings, mature or may require payment within three months or less.
The equipment operations sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to financial services. These intercompany cash flows are eliminated in the consolidated cash flows.
All cash flows from the changes in trade accounts and notes receivable (see Note 12) are classified as operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows as these receivables arise from sales to the companys customers. Cash flows from financing receivables that are related to sales to the companys customers (see Note 12) are also included in operating activities. The remaining financing receivables are related to the financing of equipment sold by independent dealers and are included in investing activities.
The company had the following non-cash operating and investing activities that were not included in the statement of consolidated cash flows. The company transferred inventory to equipment on operating leases of $563 million, $449 million and $405 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The company also had accounts payable related to purchases of property and equipment of $185 million, $135 million and $135 million at October31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Cash payments (receipts) for interest and income taxes consisted of the following in millions of dollars: 2012 2011 2010 Interest: Equipment operations $ 420 $ 370 $ 378 Financial services 638 616 679 Intercompany eliminations (248 ) (231 ) (229 ) Consolidated $ 810 $ 755 $ 828 Income taxes: Equipment operations $ 1,704 $ 1,379 $ 639 Financial services 207 336 (63 ) Intercompany eliminations (167 ) (266 ) 51 Consolidated $ 1,744 $ 1,449 $ 627 7. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS The company has several defined benefit pension plans and postretirement health care and life insurance plans covering its U.S. employees and employees in certain foreign countries. The company uses an October31 measurement date for these plans.
The components of net periodic pension cost and the assumptions related to the cost consisted of the following in millions of dollars and in percents: 2012 2011 2010 Pensions Service cost $ 220 $ 197 $ 176 Interest cost 465 492 510 Expected return on plan assets (787 ) (793 ) (761 ) Amortization of actuarial losses 202 148 113 Amortization of prior service cost 47 46 42 Early-retirement benefits 3 Settlements/curtailments 10 1 24 Net cost $ 160 $ 91 $ 104 Weighted-average assumptions Discount rates 4.4 % 5.0 % 5.5 % Rate of compensation increase 3.9 % 3.9 % 3.9 % Expected long-term rates of return 8.0 % 8.1 % 8.3 % The components of net periodic postretirement benefits cost and the assumptions related to the cost consisted of the following in millions of dollars and in percents: 2012 2011 2010 Health care and life insurance Service cost $ 49 $ 44 $ 44 Interest cost 281 326 337 Expected return on plan assets (100 ) (113 ) (122 ) Amortization of actuarial losses 136 271 311 Amortization of prior service credit (15 ) (16 ) (16 ) Net cost $ 351 $ 512 $ 554 Weighted-average assumptions Discount rates 4.4 % 5.2 % 5.6 % Expected long-term rates of return 7.7 % 7.7 % 7.8 % For fiscal year 2012, the participants in one of the companys postretirement health care plans became almost all inactive as described by the applicable accounting standards due to additional retirements. As a result, the net actuarial loss for this plan in the table above is now being amortized over the longer period for the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants rather than the average remaining service period of the active participants. The amortization of actuarial loss also decreased due to lower expected costs from the prescription drug plan to provide group benefits under Medicare PartD as an alternative to collecting the retiree drug subsidy.
39 Table of Contents The previous pension cost in net income and other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations in other comprehensive income in millions of dollars were as follows: 2012 2011 2010 Pensions Net cost $ 160 $ 91 $ 104 Retirement benefit adjustments included in other   comprehensive (income) loss: Net actuarial losses 999 848 227 Prior service cost 5 9 14 Amortization of actuarial losses (202 ) (148 ) (113 ) Amortization of prior service cost (47 ) (46 ) (42 ) Settlements/curtailments (10 ) (1 ) (24 ) Total loss recognized in other comprehensive   (income) loss 745 662 62 Total recognized in comprehensive (income) loss $ 905 $ 753 $ 166 The previous postretirement benefits cost in net income and other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations in other comprehensive income in millions of dollars were as follows: 2012 2011 2010 Health care and life insurance Net cost $ 351 $ 512 $ 554 Retirement benefit adjustments included in other   comprehensive (income) loss: Net actuarial losses (gain) 335 132 (28 ) Prior service cost 2 Amortization of actuarial losses (136 ) (271 ) (311 ) Amortization of prior service credit 15 16 16 Total (gain) loss recognized in other   comprehensive (income) loss 216 (123 ) (323 ) Total recognized in comprehensive (income) loss $ 567 $ 389 $ 231 In 2011, the company decided to participate in a prescription drug plan to provide group benefits under Medicare PartD as an alternative to collecting the retiree drug subsidy. This change, which will take effect in 2013, is expected to result in future cost savings to the company greater than the Medicare retiree drug subsidies over time. The change is included in the health care postretirement benefit obligation beginning in 2011. The participants level of benefits will not be affected.
The benefit plan obligations, funded status and the assumptions related to the obligations at October31 in millions of dollars follow: HealthCare and Pensions LifeInsurance 2012 2011 2012 2011 Change in benefit obligations Beginning of year balance $ (10,925 ) $ (10,197 ) $ (6,652 ) $ (6,467 ) Service cost (220 ) (197 ) (49 ) (44 ) Interest cost (465 ) (492 ) (281 ) (326 ) Actuarial losses (947 ) (656 ) (347 ) (113 ) Amendments (5 ) (9 ) (2 ) Benefits paid 656 648 333 340 Health care subsidy receipts (15 ) (14 ) Settlements/curtailments 10 1 Foreign exchange and other 62 (23 ) (10 ) (28 ) End of year balance (11,834 ) (10,925 ) (7,023 ) (6,652 ) Change in plan assets (fair   value) Beginning of year balance 9,552 9,504 1,459 1,637 Actual return on plan assets 736 600 113 95 Employer contribution 441 79 37 43 Benefits paid (656 ) (648 ) (333 ) (340 ) Settlements (10 ) (1 ) Foreign exchange and other (46 ) 18 11 24 End of year balance 10,017 9,552 1,287 1,459 Funded status $ (1,817 ) $ (1,373 ) $ (5,736 ) $ (5,193 ) Weighted-average assumptions Discount rates 3.8 % 4.4 % 3.8 % 4.4 % Rate of compensation increase 3.9 % 3.9 % The amounts recognized at October31 in millions of dollars consist of the following: HealthCare and Pensions LifeInsurance 2012 2011 2012 2011 Amounts recognized in balance   sheet Noncurrent asset $ 20 $ 30 Current liability (53 ) (60 ) $ (23 ) $ (23 ) Noncurrent liability (1,784 ) (1,343 ) (5,713 ) (5,170 ) Total $ (1,817 ) $ (1,373 ) $ (5,736 ) $ (5,193 ) Amounts recognized in accumulated   other comprehensive income  pretax Net actuarial losses $ 5,260 $ 4,473 $ 2,266 $ 2,067 Prior service cost (credit) 105 147 (47 ) (64 ) Total $ 5,365 $ 4,620 $ 2,219 $ 2,003 40 Table of Contents The total accumulated benefit obligations for all pension plans at October31, 2012 and 2011 was $11,181 million and $10,363 million, respectively.
The accumulated benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $10,987 million and $9,787 million, respectively, at October31, 2012 and $10,168 million and $9,321 million, respectively, at October31, 2011. The projected benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $11,627 million and $9,790 million, respectively, at October31, 2012 and $10,784 million and $9,381 million, respectively, at October31, 2011.
The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income that are expected to be amortized as net expense (income) during fiscal 2013 in millions of dollars follow: HealthCare and Pensions LifeInsurance Net actuarial losses $ 263 $ 147 Prior service cost (credit) 33 (6 ) Total $ 296 $ 141 The company expects to contribute approximately $527 million to its pension plans and approximately $27 million to its health care and life insurance plans in 2013, which include direct benefit payments on unfunded plans.
The benefits expected to be paid from the benefit plans, which reflect expected future years of service, and the Medicare subsidy expected to be received are as follows in millions of dollars: HealthCare HealthCare and Subsidy Pensions LifeInsurance Receipts* 2013 $ 682 $ 338 $ 4 2014 683 345 2015 680 356 2016 683 366 2017 689 384 2018 to 2022 3,490 1,947 * Medicare PartD subsidy.
The annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits (the health care cost trend rates) used to determine accumulated postretirement benefit obligations were based on the trends for medical and prescription drug claims for pre- and post-65 age groups due to the effects of Medicare. At October31, 2012, the weighted-average composite trend rates for these obligations were assumed to be a 7.1 percent increase from 2012 to 2013, gradually decreasing to 5.0 percent from 2018 to 2019 and all future years. The obligations at October31, 2011 and the cost in 2012 assumed a 7.3 percent increase from 2011 to 2012, gradually decreasing to 5.0 percent from 2017 to 2018 and all future years. An increase of one percentage point in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations by $955 million and the aggregate of service and interest cost component of net periodic postretirement benefits cost for the year by $50 million. A decrease of one percentage point would decrease the obligations by $723 million and the cost by $38 million.
The discount rate assumptions used to determine the postretirement obligations at October31, 2012 and 2011 were based on hypothetical AA yield curves represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates. These discount rates represent the rates at which the companys benefit obligations could effectively be settled at the October31 measurement dates.
Fair value measurement levels in the following tables are defined in Note 26.
The fair values of the pension plan assets at October31, 2012 follow in millions of dollars: Total Level1 Level2 Level3 Cash and short-term investments $ 1,166 $ 287 $ 879 Equity: U.S. equity securities 2,481 2,481 U.S. equity funds 43 8 35 International equity securities 1,477 1,477 International equity funds 411 49 362 Fixed Income: Government and agency securities 404 379 25 Corporate debt securities 220 220 Mortgage-backed securities 126 126 Fixed income funds 853 92 761 Real estate 537 104 14 $ 419 Private equity/venture capital 1,319 1,319 Hedge funds 578 2 422 154 Other investments 508 1 507 Derivative contracts - assets* 721 1 720 Derivative contracts - liabilities** (454 ) (20 ) (434 ) Receivables, payables and other (41 ) (41 ) Securities lending collateral 223 223 Securities lending liability (223 ) (223 ) Securities sold short (332 ) (332 ) Total net assets $ 10,017 $ 4,488 $ 3,637 $ 1,892 * Includes contracts for interest rates of $707 million, foreign currency of $8 million and other of $6 million.

42 Table of Contents Fair values are determined as follows: Cash and Short-Term Investments Includes accounts and cash funds that are valued based on the account value, which approximates fair value, or on the funds net asset value (NAV) based on the fair value of the underlying securities. Also included are securities that are valued using a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
Equity Securities and Funds The values are determined primarily by closing prices in the active market in which the equity investment trades, or the funds NAV, based on the fair value of the underlying securities.
Fixed Income Securities and Funds The securities are valued using either a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, credit risk and prepayment speeds, or they are valued using the closing prices in the active market in which the fixed income investment trades. Fixed income funds are valued using the NAV, based on the fair value of the underlying securities.
Real Estate,Venture Capital and Private Equity The investments, which are structured as limited partnerships, are valued using an income approach (estimated cash flows discounted over the expected holding period), as well as a market approach (the valuation of similar securities and properties). These investments are valued at estimated fair value based on their proportionate share of the limited partnerships fair value that is determined by the general partner. Real estate investment trusts are valued at the closing prices in the active markets in which the investment trades. Real estate investment funds are valued at the NAV, based on the fair value of the underlying securities.
Hedge Funds and Other Investments The investments are valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund, which is based on the fair value of the underlying securities.
Interest Rate, Foreign Currency and Other Derivative Instruments The derivatives are valued using either an income approach (discounted cash flow) using market observable inputs, including swap curves and both forward and spot exchange rates, or a market approach (closing prices in the active market in which the derivative instrument trades).
The primary investment objective for the pension plan assets is to maximize the growth of these assets to meet the projected obligations to the beneficiaries over a long period of time, and to do so in a manner that is consistent with the companys earnings strength and risk tolerance. The primary investment objective for the health care plan assets is to provide the company with the financial flexibility to pay the projected obligations to beneficiaries over a long period of time. The asset allocation policy is the most important decision in managing the assets and it is reviewed regularly. The asset allocation policy considers the companys financial strength and long-term asset class risk/return expectations since the obligations are long-term in nature. The current target allocations for pension assets are approximately 42 percent for equity securities, 31 percent for debt securities, 5 percent for real estate and 22 percent for other investments. The target allocations for health care assets are approximately 51 percent for equity securities, 31 percent for debt securities, 3 percent for real estate and 15 percent for other investments. The allocation percentages above include the effects of combining derivatives with other investments to manage asset allocations and exposures to interest rates and foreign currency exchange. The assets are well diversified and are managed by professional investment firms as well as by investment professionals who are company employees. As a result of the companys diversified investment policy, there were no significant concentrations of risk.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects managements expectations of long-term average rates of return on funds invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. The expected return is based on the outlook for inflation and for returns in multiple asset classes, while also considering historical returns, asset allocation and investment strategy. The companys approach has emphasized the long-term nature of the return estimate such that the return assumption is not changed unless there are fundamental changes in capital markets that affect the companys expectations for returns over an extended period of time (i.e., 10 to 20 years). The average annual return of the companys U.S. pension fund was approximately 9.3 percent during the past ten years and approximately 9.7 percent during the past 20 years. Since return premiums over inflation and total returns for major asset classes vary widely even over ten-year periods, recent history is not necessarily indicative of long-term future expected returns. The companys systematic methodology for determining the long-term rate of return for the companys investment strategies supports the long-term expected return assumptions.
The company has created certain Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association trusts (VEBAs) for the funding of postretirement health care benefits. The future expected asset returns for these VEBAs are lower than the expected return on the other pension and health care plan assets due to investment in a higher proportion of liquid securities. These assets are in addition to the other postretirement health care plan assets that have been funded under Section401(h)of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and maintained in a separate account in the companys pension plan trust.
The company has defined contribution plans related to employee investment and savings plans primarily in the U.S. The companys contributions and costs under these plans were $155 million in 2012, $108 million in 2011 and $85 million in 2010. The contribution rate varies primarily based on the companys performance in the prior year and employee participation in the plans.
43 Table of Contents 8. INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes by taxing jurisdiction and by significant component consisted of the following in millions of dollars: 2012 2011 2010 Current: U.S.: Federal $ 1,277 $ 928 $ 574 State 119 144 50 Foreign 355 520 363 Total current 1,751 1,592 987 Deferred: U.S.: Federal (76 ) (135 ) 156 State (7 ) (28 ) 11 Foreign (9 ) (5 ) 8 Total deferred (92 ) (168 ) 175 Provision for income taxes $ 1,659 $ 1,424 $ 1,162 Based upon the location of the companys operations, the consolidated income before income taxes in the U.S. in 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $3,582 million, $2,618 million and $2,048 million, respectively, and in foreign countries was $1,152 million, $1,605 million and $977 million, respectively. Certain foreign operations are branches of Deere& Company and are, therefore, subject to U.S. as well as foreign income tax regulations. The pretax income by location and the preceding analysis of the income tax provision by taxing jurisdiction are, therefore, not directly related.
A comparison of the statutory and effective income tax provision and reasons for related differences in millions of dollars follow: 2012 2011 2010 U. S. federal income tax   provision at a statutory rate of 35 percent $ 1,657 $ 1,478 $ 1,059 Increase (decrease) resulting from: Valuation allowance on foreign deferred taxes 200 18 5 State and local income taxes, net of federal   income tax benefit 73 75 40 Nondeductible health care claims* 123 Nondeductible goodwill impairment charge 6 7 Nontaxable foreign partnership earnings (172 ) Tax rates on foreign earnings (69 ) (70 ) (59 ) Research and development tax credits (10 ) (38 ) (5 ) Wind energy production tax credits (30 ) Other-net (26 ) (39 ) 22 Provision for income taxes $ 1,659 $ 1,424 $ 1,162 * Cumulative adjustment from change in law. Effect included in state taxes was $7 million.
At October31, 2012, accumulated earnings in certain subsidiaries outside the U.S. totaled $3,209 million for which no provision for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes has been made, because it is expected that such earnings will be reinvested outside the U.S. indefinitely. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable. At October31, 2012, the amount of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held by these foreign subsidiaries was $628 million.
Deferred income taxes arise because there are certain items that are treated differently for financial accounting than for income tax reporting purposes. An analysis of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities at October31 in millions of dollars follows: 2012 2011 Deferred Deferred Deferred Deferred Tax Tax Tax Tax Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Other postretirement benefit liabilities $ 2,136 $ 1,944 Tax over book depreciation $ 606 $ 492 Accrual for sales allowances 546 438 Pension liabilities - net 457 279 Lease transactions 317 309 Accrual for employee benefits 249 189 Tax loss and tax credit carryforwards 249 121 Share-based compensation 133 113 Inventory 131 152 Goodwill and other intangible assets 110 123 Allowance for credit losses 92 115 Deferred gains on distributed foreign earnings 84 83 Deferred compensation 40 37 Undistributed foreign earnings 11 19 Other items 443 115 348 112 Less valuation allowances (285 ) (74 ) Deferred income tax assets and   liabilities $ 4,275 $ 1,159 $ 3,745 $ 1,055 Deere& Company files a consolidated federal income tax return in the U.S., which includes the wholly-owned financial services subsidiaries. These subsidiaries account for income taxes generally as if they filed separate income tax returns.
At October31, 2012, certain tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of $249 million were available with $127 million expiring from 2013 through 2032 and $122 million with an indefinite carryforward period.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 was signed into law in the companys second fiscal quarter of 2010. Under the legislation, to the extent the companys future health care drug expenses are reimbursed under the Medicare PartD retiree drug subsidy program, the expenses will no longer be tax deductible effective November1, 2013. Since the tax effects for the retiree health care liabilities were reflected in the companys financial statements, the entire impact of this tax change relating to the future retiree drug costs was recorded in tax expense in the second quarter of 2010, which was the period in which the legislation was enacted. As a result of the legislation, the companys tax expenses increased approximately $130 million in 2010.
44 Table of Contents A reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at October31 in millions of dollars follows: 2012 2011 2010 Beginning of year balance $ 199 $ 218 $ 260 Increases to tax positions taken during the   current year 46 23 36 Increases to tax positions taken during prior   years 54 13 83 Decreases to tax positions taken during prior   years (14 ) (42 ) (133 ) Decreases due to lapse of statute of limitations (9 ) (13 ) (2 ) Settlements (1 ) (19 ) Foreign exchange (11 ) 1 (7 ) End of year balance $ 265 $ 199 $ 218 The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at October31, 2012 that would affect the effective tax rate if the tax benefits were recognized was $65 million. The remaining liability was related to tax positions for which there are offsetting tax receivables, or the uncertainty was only related to timing. The company expects that any reasonably possible change in the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months would not be significant.
The company files its tax returns according to the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates, which includes the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has completed the examination of the companys federal income tax returns for periods prior to 2009. The years 2009 and 2010 federal income tax returns are currently under examination. Various state and foreign income tax returns, including major tax jurisdictions in Canada and Germany, also remain subject to examination by taxing authorities.
The companys policy is to recognize interest related to income taxes in interest expense and interest income, and recognize penalties in selling, administrative and general expenses. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the total amount of expense from interest and penalties was $6 million, $3 million and $3 million and the interest income was $1 million, $3 million and $5 million, respectively. At October31, 2012 and 2011, the liability for accrued interest and penalties totaled $39 million and $39 million and the receivable for interest was $1 million and $7 million, respectively.
9. OTHER INCOME AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES The major components of other income and other operating expenses consisted of the following in millions of dollars: 2012 2011 2010 Other income Insurance premiums and fees earned $ 248 $ 236 $ 198 Revenues from services 233 217 276 Investment income 14 11 10 Other 180 160 122 Total $ 675 $ 624 $ 606 Other operating expenses Depreciation of equipment on operating leases $ 339 $ 306 $ 288 Insurance claims and expenses 245 193 146 Cost of services 122 115 198 Other 76 102 116 Total $ 782 $ 716 $ 748 The company issues insurance policies for crop insurance and extended equipment warranties. Beginning in 2011, the crop insurance subsidiary utilized reinsurance to limit its losses and reduce its exposure to claims. Prior to 2011, the crop insurance business was conducted through managing general agency agreements with external insurance companies. Although reinsurance contracts permit recovery of certain claims from reinsurers, the insurance subsidiary is not relieved of its primary obligation to the policyholders. The premiums ceded by the crop insurance subsidiary in 2012 and 2011 were $251 million and $246 million, and claims recoveries on the ceded business were $493 million and $271 million, respectively. These amounts from reinsurance are netted against the insurance premiums and fees earned and the insurance claims and expenses in the table above.
10. UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATED COMPANIES Unconsolidated affiliated companies are companies in which Deere& Company generally owns 20 percent to 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares. Deere& Company does not control these companies and accounts for its investments in them on the equity basis. The investments in these companies primarily consist of Bell Equipment Limited (32 percent ownership), Deere-Hitachi Construction Machinery Corporation (50 percent ownership), John Deere Tiantuo Company,Ltd. (51 percent ownership), Xuzhou XCG John Deere Machinery Manufacturing Co.,Ltd. (50 percent ownership) and Ashok Leyland John Deere Construction Equipment Company Private Limited (50 percent ownership). The unconsolidated affiliated companies primarily manufacture or market equipment. Deere& Companys share of the income or loss of these companies is reported in the consolidated income statement under Equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates. The investment in these companies is reported in the consolidated balance sheet under Investments in unconsolidated affiliates.
45 Table of Contents Combined financial information of the unconsolidated affiliated companies in millions of dollars follows: Operations 2012 2011 2010 Sales $ 2,722 $ 2,233 $ 1,502 Net income (loss) (1 ) 34 23 Deere& Companys equity in net income   (loss) (3 ) 9 11 FinancialPosition 2012 2011 Total assets $ 1,621 $ 1,357 Total external borrowings 345 321 Total net assets 558 495 Deere& Companys share of the net assets 215 202 Consolidated retained earnings at October31, 2012 include undistributed earnings of the unconsolidated affiliates of $63 million. Dividends from unconsolidated affiliates were $.2 million in 2012, $18 million in 2011 and $6 million in 2010.
11. MARKETABLE SECURITIES All marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a component of stockholders equity. Realized gains or losses from the sales of marketable securities are based on the specific identification method.
The amortized cost and fair value of marketable securities at October31 in millions of dollars follow: Gross Gross Amortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair Cost Gains Losses Value 2012 U.S. government debt securities $ 1,193 $ 7 $ 1,200 Municipal debt securities 35 3 38 Corporate debt securities 100 10 110 Mortgage-backed securities* 117 6 $ 1 122 Marketable securities $ 1,445 $ 26 $ 1 $ 1,470 2011 U.S. government debt securities $ 571 $ 6 $ 1 $ 576 Municipal debt securities 34 2 36 Corporate debt securities 83 6 89 Mortgage-backed securities* 82 4 86 Marketable securities $ 770 $ 18 $ 1 $ 787 * Primarily issued by U.S. government sponsored enterprises.
The contractual maturities of debt securities at October31, 2012 in millions of dollars follow: Amortized Fair Cost Value Due in one year or less $ 813 $ 813 Due after one through five years 366 370 Due after five through 10 years 85 93 Due after 10 years 64 72 Mortgage-backed securities 117 122 Debt securities $ 1,445 $ 1,470 Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some securities may be called or prepaid. Because of the potential for prepayment on mortgage-backed securities, they are not categorized by contractual maturity. Proceeds from the sales of available-for-sale securities were $7 million in 2012, $2 million in 2011 and none in 2010. Realized gains, realized losses, the increase (decrease) in net unrealized gains or losses and unrealized losses that have been continuous for over twelve months were not significant in 2012, 2011 and 2010. Unrealized losses at October31, 2012 and 2011 were primarily the result of an increase in interest rates and were not recognized in income due to the ability and intent to hold to maturity. There were no impairment write-downs in the periods reported.
12. RECEIVABLES Trade Accounts and Notes Receivable Trade accounts and notes receivable at October31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars: 2012 2011 Trade accounts and notes: Agriculture and turf $ 3,074 $ 2,618 Construction and forestry 725 676 Trade accounts and notes   receivablenet $ 3,799 $ 3,294 At October31, 2012 and 2011, dealer notes included in the previous table were $95 million and $97 million, and the allowance for doubtful trade receivables was $66 million and $72 million, respectively.
The equipment operations sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to financial services and provide compensation to these operations at approximate market rates of interest.
Trade accounts and notes receivable primarily arise from sales of goods to independent dealers. Under the terms of the sales to dealers, interest is primarily charged to dealers on outstanding balances, from the earlier of the date when goods are sold to retail customers by the dealer or the expiration of certain interest-free periods granted at the time of the sale to the dealer, until payment is received by the company. Dealers cannot cancel purchases after the equipment is shipped and are responsible for payment even if the equipment is not sold to retail customers. The interest-free periods are determined based on the type of equipment sold and the time of year of the sale. These periods range from one to twelve months for most equipment. Interest-free periods may not be extended. Interest charged may not be forgiven and the past due interest rates exceed market rates. The company evaluates and assesses dealers on an ongoing basis as to their creditworthiness and generally retains a security interest in the goods associated with the trade receivables. The company is obligated to repurchase goods sold to a dealer upon cancellation or termination of the dealers contract for such causes as change in ownership and closeout of the business.
Trade accounts and notes receivable have significant concentrations of credit risk in the agriculture and turf sector and construction and forestry sector as shown in the 46 Table of Contents previous table. On a geographic basis, there is not a disproportionate concentration of credit risk in any area.
Financing Receivables Financing receivables at October31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars: 2012 2011 Unrestricted/Securitized Unrestricted/Securitized Retail notes: Equipment: Agriculture and turf $ 14,144 $ 3,126 $ 12,969 $ 2,597 Construction and forestry 1,091 553 1,036 362 Recreational products 4 Total 15,235 3,679 14,009 2,959 Wholesale notes 3,888 3,006 Revolving charge accounts 2,488 2,518 Financing leases (direct and sales-type) 1,411 1,242 Operating loans 42 84 Total financing receivables 23,064 3,679 20,859 2,959 Less: Unearned finance income: Equipment notes 619 44 635 36 Financing leases 126 121 Total 745 44 756 36 Allowance for credit losses 160 17 179 18 Financing receivables  net $ 22,159 $ 3,618 $ 19,924 $ 2,905 The residual values for investments in financing leases at October31, 2012 and 2011 totaled $79 million and $75 million, respectively.
Financing receivables have significant concentrations of credit risk in the agriculture and turf sector and construction and forestry sector as shown in the previous table. On a geographic basis, there is not a disproportionate concentration of credit risk in any area. The company retains as collateral a security interest in the equipment associated with retail notes, wholesale notes and financing leases.
Financing receivables at October31 related to the companys sales of equipment that were included in the table above consisted of the following in millions of dollars: 2012 2011 Unrestricted Unrestricted Retail notes*: Equipment: Agriculture and turf $ 1,810 $ 1,633 Construction and forestry 313 310 Total 2,123 1,943 Wholesale notes 3,888 3,006 Sales-type leases 836 776 Total 6,847 5,725 Less: Unearned finance income: Equipment notes 191 197 Sales-type leases 61 64 Total 252 261 Financing receivables related to   the companys sales of equipment $ 6,595 $ 5,464 * These retail notes generally arise from sales of equipment by company-owned dealers or through direct sales.
Financing receivable installments, including unearned finance income, at October31 are scheduled as follows in millions of dollars: 2012 2011 Unrestricted/Securitized Unrestricted/Securitized Due in months: 0 - 12 $ 11,486 $ 1,437 $ 10,311 $ 1,192 13 - 24 4,257 1,004 3,937 807 25 - 36 3,232 712 2,960 524 37 - 48 2,278 399 2,032 305 49 - 60 1,356 120 1,196 119 Thereafter 455 7 423 12 Total $ 23,064 $ 3,679 $ 20,859 $ 2,959 The maximum terms for retail notes are generally seven years for agriculture and turf equipment and five years for construction and forestry equipment. The maximum term for financing leases is generally five years, while the average term for wholesale notes is less than twelve months.
At October31, 2012 and 2011, the unpaid balances of receivables administered but not owned were $120 million and $146 million, respectively. At October31, 2012 and 2011, worldwide financing receivables administered, which include financing receivables administered but not owned, totaled $25,897 million and $22,974 million, respectively.
Past due balances of financing receivables still accruing finance income represent the total balance held (principal plus accrued interest) with any payment amounts 30 days or more past the contractual payment due date. Non-performing financing receivables represent loans for which the company has ceased accruing finance income. These receivables are generally 120 days delinquent and the estimated uncollectible amount, after charging the dealers withholding account, has been written off to the allowance for credit losses. Finance income for non-performing receivables is recognized on a cash basis. Accrual of finance income is resumed when the receivable becomes contractually current and collections are reasonably assured.

The allowance for credit losses represented .68 percent and .86 percent of financing receivables outstanding at October31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In addition, at October31, 2012 and 2011, the companys financial services operations had $194 million and $188 million, respectively, of deposits withheld from dealers and merchants available for potential credit losses.
Financing receivables are considered impaired when it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms. Receivables reviewed for impairment generally include those that are either past due, or have provided bankruptcy notification, or require significant collection efforts. Receivables that are impaired are generally classified as non-performing.

A troubled debt restructuring is generally the modification of debt in which a creditor grants a concession it would not otherwise consider to a debtor that is experiencing financial difficulties. These modifications may include a reduction of the stated interest rate, an extension of the maturity dates, a reduction of the face amount or maturity amount of the debt, or a reduction of accrued interest. During 2012 and 2011, the company identified 138 and 213 financing receivable contracts, primarily retail notes, as troubled debt restructurings with aggregate balances of $5 million and $11 million pre-modification and $4 million and $10 million post-modification, respectively. During these same periods, there were no significant troubled debt restructurings that subsequently defaulted and were written off. At October31, 2012, the company had no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose accounts were modified in troubled debt restructurings.
Other Receivables Other receivables at October31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars: 2012 2011 Taxes receivable $ 971 $ 844 Reinsurance receivables 569 242 Insurance premium receivables 69 58 Other 182 187 Other receivables $ 1,791 $ 1,331 Reinsurance and insurance premium receivables are associated with the financial services crop insurance subsidiary (see Note 9).
13. SECURITIZATION OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES The company, as a part of its overall funding strategy, periodically transfers certain financing receivables (retail notes) into variable interest entities (VIEs) that are special purpose entities (SPEs), or a non-VIE banking operation, as part of its asset-backed securities programs (securitizations). The structure of these transactions is such that the transfer of the retail notes did not meet the criteria of sales of receivables, and is, therefore, accounted for as a secured borrowing. SPEs utilized in securitizations of retail notes differ from other entities included in the companys consolidated statements because the assets they hold are legally isolated. Use of the assets held by the SPEs or the non-VIE is restricted by terms of the documents governing the securitization transactions.
In securitizations of retail notes related to secured borrowings, the retail notes are transferred to certain SPEs or to a non-VIE banking operation, which in turn issue debt to investors. The resulting secured borrowings are recorded as Short-term securitization borrowings on the balance sheet.
49 Table of Contents The securitized retail notes are recorded as Financing receivables securitized - net on the balance sheet. The total restricted assets on the balance sheet related to these securitizations include the financing receivables securitized less an allowance for credit losses, and other assets primarily representing restricted cash. For those securitizations in which retail notes are transferred into SPEs, the SPEs supporting the secured borrowings are consolidated unless the company does not have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the SPEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the SPEs. No additional support to these SPEs beyond what was previously contractually required has been provided during the reporting periods.
In certain securitizations, the company consolidates the SPEs since it has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the SPEs economic performance through its role as servicer of all the receivables held by the SPEs, and the obligation through variable interests in the SPEs to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the SPEs. The restricted assets (retail notes securitized, allowance for credit losses and other assets) of the consolidated SPEs totaled $2,330 million and $1,523 million at October31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The liabilities (short-term securitization borrowings and accrued interest) of these SPEs totaled $2,262 million and $1,395 million at October31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The credit holders of these SPEs do not have legal recourse to the companys general credit.
In certain securitizations, the company transfers retail notes to a non-VIE banking operation, which is not consolidated since the company does not have a controlling interest in the entity. The companys carrying values and interests related to the securitizations with the unconsolidated non-VIE were restricted assets (retail notes securitized, allowance for credit losses and other assets) of $324 million and $369 million at October31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The liabilities (short-term securitization borrowings and accrued interest) were $310 million and $346 million at October31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
In certain securitizations, the company transfers retail notes into bank-sponsored, multi-seller, commercial paper conduits, which are SPEs that are not consolidated. The company does not service a significant portion of the conduits receivables, and therefore, does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the conduits economic performance. These conduits provide a funding source to the company (as well as other transferors into the conduit) as they fund the retail notes through the issuance of commercial paper. The companys carrying values and variable interest related to these conduits were restricted assets (retail notes securitized, allowance for credit losses and other assets) of $1,049 million and $1,109 million at October31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The liabilities (short-term securitization borrowings and accrued interest) related to these conduits were $1,004 million and $1,038 million at October31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
The companys carrying amount of the liabilities to the unconsolidated conduits, compared to the maximum exposure to loss related to these conduits, which would only be incurred in the event of a complete loss on the restricted assets, was as follows at October31 in millions of dollars: 2012 Carrying value of liabilities $ 1,004 Maximum exposure to loss 1,049 The total assets of unconsolidated VIEs related to securitizations were approximately $31 billion at October31, 2012.
The components of consolidated restricted assets related to secured borrowings in securitization transactions at October31 were as follows in millions of dollars: 2012 2011 Financing receivables securitized (retail notes) $ 3,635 $ 2,923 Allowance for credit losses (17 ) (18 ) Other assets 85 96 Total restricted securitized   assets $ 3,703 $ 3,001 The components of consolidated secured borrowings and other liabilities related to securitizations at October31 were as follows in millions of dollars: 2012 2011 Short-term securitization borrowings $ 3,575 $ 2,777 Accrued interest on borrowings 1 2 Total liabilities related to   restricted securitized assets $ 3,576 $ 2,779 The secured borrowings related to these restricted securitized retail notes are obligations that are payable as the retail notes are liquidated. Repayment of the secured borrowings depends primarily on cash flows generated by the restricted assets. Due to the companys short-term credit rating, cash collections from these restricted assets are not required to be placed into a segregated collection account until immediately prior to the time payment is required to the secured creditors. At October31, 2012, the maximum remaining term of all securitized retail notes was approximately six years.
14. EQUIPMENT ON OPERATING LEASES Operating leases arise primarily from the leasing of John Deere equipment to retail customers. Initial lease terms generally range from four to 60 months. Net equipment on operating leases totaled $2,528 million and $2,150 million at October31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the terms of the lease. The accumulated depreciation on this equipment was $499 million and $478 million at October31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The corresponding depreciation expense was $339 million in 2012, $306 million in 2011 and $288 million in 2010.
Future payments to be received on operating leases totaled $1,067 million at October31, 2012 and are scheduled in millions of dollars as follows: 2013  $445, 2014  $308, 2015  $188, 2016  $103 and 2017  $23.
50 Table of Contents 15. INVENTORIES Most inventories owned by Deere& Company and its U.S. equipment subsidiaries are valued at cost, on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. Remaining inventories are generally valued at the lower of cost, on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. The value of gross inventories on the LIFO basis represented 61 percent and 59 percent of worldwide gross inventories at FIFO value at October31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. If all inventories had been valued on a FIFO basis, estimated inventories by major classification at October31 in millions of dollars would have been as follows: 2012 2011 Raw materials and supplies $ 1,874 $ 1,626 Work-in-process 652 647 Finished goods and parts 4,065 3,584 Total FIFO value 6,591 5,857 Less adjustment to LIFO value 1,421 1,486 Inventories $ 5,170 $ 4,371 16.

Capitalized interest was $7 million, $8 million and $6 million in the same periods, respectively. The cost of leased property and equipment under capital leases of $47 million and $41 million and accumulated depreciation of $25 million and $23 million at October31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, is included in property and equipment.
Capitalized software has an estimated useful life of three years. The amounts of total capitalized software costs, including purchased and internally developed software, classified as Other Assets at October31, 2012 and 2011 were $684 million and $592 million, less accumulated amortization of $493 million and $451 million, respectively. Amortization of these software costs was $89 million in 2012, $73 million in 2011 and $68 million in 2010. The cost of leased software assets under capital leases amounting to $42 million and $40 million at October31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, is included in other assets.
The cost of compliance with foreseeable environmental requirements has been accrued and did not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements.

Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. The amortization of other intangible assets in 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $21 million, $20 million and $18 million, respectively. The estimated amortization expense for the next five years is as follows in millions of dollars: 2013  $18, 2014  $16, 2015  $15, 2016  $14 and 2017  $13.
18. TOTAL SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS Total short-term borrowings at October31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars: 2012 2011 Equipment Operations Commercial paper $ 146 $ 265 Notes payable to banks 84 19 Long-term borrowings due within one year 195 244 Total 425 528 Financial Services Commercial paper 1,061 1,014 Notes payable to banks 117 61 Long-term borrowings due within one year 4,790 * 5,249 * Total 5,968 6,324 Short-term borrowings 6,393 6,852 Financial Services Short-term securitization borrowings 3,575 2,777 Total short-term borrowings $ 9,968 $ 9,629 * Includes unamortized fair value adjustments related to interest rate swaps.
The short-term securitization borrowings for financial services are secured by financing receivables (retail notes) on the balance sheet (see Note 13). Although these securitization borrowings are classified as short-term since payment is required if the retail notes are liquidated early, the payment schedule for these borrowings of $3,575 million at October31, 2012 based on the expected liquidation of the retail notes in millions of dollars is as follows: 2013  $1,853, 2014  $1,043, 2015  $499, 2016  $162, 2017  $17 and 2018  $1.
The weighted-average interest rates on total short-term borrowings, excluding current maturities of long-term borrowings, at October31, 2012 and 2011 were 1.0 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively.
Lines of credit available from U.S. and foreign banks were $5,194 million at October31, 2012. At October31, 2012, $3,793 million of these worldwide lines of credit were unused. For the purpose of computing the unused credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings, excluding secured borrowings and the current portion of long-term borrowings, were primarily considered to constitute utilization. Included in the above lines of credit were long-term credit facility agreements for $2,750 million, expiring in April2015, and $1,500 million, expiring in April2017. The agreements are mutually extendable and the annual facility fees are not significant. These credit agreements require Capital Corporation to maintain its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter and the ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to capital base (total subordinated debt and stockholders equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than 11 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. The credit agreements also require the equipment operations to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capital (total debt and stockholders equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) of 65 percent or less at the end of each fiscal quarter. Under this provision, the companys excess equity capacity and retained earnings balance free of restriction at October31, 2012 was $8,273 million. Alternatively under this provision, the equipment operations had the capacity to incur additional debt of $15,364 million at October31, 2012. All of these requirements of the credit agreements have been met during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.
Deere& Company has an agreement with Capital Corporation pursuant to which it has agreed to continue to own, directly or through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of Capital Corporation and to maintain Capital Corporations consolidated tangible net worth at not less than $50 million. This agreement also obligates Deere& Company to make payments to Capital Corporation such that its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter. Deere& Companys obligations to make payments to Capital Corporation under the agreement are independent of whether Capital Corporation is in default on its indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Further, Deere& Companys obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of Capital Corporations indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Deere& Companys obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of any specific indebtedness, obligation or liability of Capital Corporation and are enforceable only by or in the name of Capital Corporation. No payments were required under this agreement during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.

The approximate principal amounts of the equipment operations long-term borrowings maturing in each of the next five years in millions of dollars are as follows: 2013  $195, 2014  $778, 2015  $240, 2016  $23 and 2017  $25. The approximate principal amounts of the financial services long-term borrowings maturing in each of the next five years in millions of dollars are as follows: 2013  $4,774, 2014  $4,283, 2015  $3,480, 2016  $1,843 and 2017  $2,651.
21. LEASES At October31, 2012, future minimum lease payments under capital leases amounted to $57 million as follows: 2013  $28, 2014  $17, 2015  $4, 2016  $2, 2017  $2 and later years $4. Total rental expense for operating leases was $215 million in 2012, $175 million in 2011 and $189 million in 2010. At October31, 2012, future minimum lease payments under operating leases amounted to $462 million as follows: 2013  $148, 2014  $108, 2015  $74, 2016  $45, 2017  $30 and later years $57.
22. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The company generally determines its warranty liability by applying historical claims rate experience to the estimated amount of equipment that has been sold and is still under warranty based on dealer inventories and retail sales. The historical claims rate is primarily determined by a review of five-year claims costs and current quality developments.
The premiums for the companys extended warranties are primarily recognized in income in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred over the contract period. The unamortized extended warranty premiums (deferred revenue) included in the following table totaled $292 million and $230 million at October31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
53 Table of Contents A reconciliation of the changes in the warranty liability and unearned premiums in millions of dollars follows: WarrantyLiability/ UnearnedPremiums 2012 2011 Beginning of year balance $ 892 $ 762 Payments (580 ) (517 ) Amortization of premiums received (100 ) (93 ) Accruals for warranties 666 665 Premiums received 164 120 Foreign exchange (17 ) (45 ) End of year balance $ 1,025 $ 892 At October31, 2012, the company had approximately $290 million of guarantees issued primarily to banks outside the U.S. related to third-party receivables for the retail financing of John Deere equipment. The company may recover a portion of any required payments incurred under these agreements from repossession of the equipment collateralizing the receivables. At October31, 2012, the company had accrued losses of approximately $8 million under these agreements. The maximum remaining term of the receivables guaranteed at October31, 2012 was approximately five years.
At October31, 2012, the company had commitments of approximately $418 million for the construction and acquisition of property and equipment. At October31, 2012, the company also had pledged or restricted assets of $129 million, primarily as collateral for borrowings. In addition, see Note 13 for restricted assets associated with borrowings related to securitizations.
The company also had other miscellaneous contingencies totaling approximately $50 million at October31, 2012, for which it believes the probability for payment is substantially remote. The accrued liability for these contingencies was not material at October31, 2012.
The company is subject to various unresolved legal actions which arise in the normal course of its business, the most prevalent of which relate to product liability (including asbestos related liability), retail credit, software licensing, patent, trademark and environmental matters. The company believes the reasonably possible range of losses for these unresolved legal actions in addition to the amounts accrued would not have a material effect on its financial statements.
23. CAPITAL STOCK Changes in the common stock account in millions were as follows: Numberof SharesIssued Amount Balance at October31, 2009 536.4 $ 2,996 Stock options and other 110 Balance at October31, 2010 536.4 3,106 Stock options and other 146 Balance at October31, 2011 536.4 3,252 Stock options and other 100 Balance at October31, 2012 536.4 $ 3,352 The number of common shares the company is authorized to issue is 1,200 million. The number of authorized preferred shares, none of which has been issued, is nine million.
The Board of Directors at its meeting in May2008 authorized the repurchase of up to $5,000 million of additional common stock (58.5 million shares based on the October31, 2012 closing common stock price of $85.44 per share). At October31, 2012, this repurchase program had $2,489 million (29.1 million shares at the same price) remaining to be repurchased. Repurchases of the companys common stock under this plan will be made from time to time, at the companys discretion, in the open market.
A reconciliation of basic and diluted net income per share attributable to Deere& Company follows in millions, except per share amounts: 2012 2011 2010 Net income attributable to Deere&   Company $ 3,064.7 $ 2,799.9 $ 1,865.0 Less income allocable to participating securities .8 1.0 .7 Income allocable to common stock $ 3,063.9 $ 2,798.9 $ 1,864.3 Average shares outstanding 397.1 417.4 424.0 Basic per share $ 7.72 $ 6.71 $ 4.40 Average shares outstanding 397.1 417.4 424.0 Effect of dilutive stock options 4.4 5.0 4.6 Total potential shares outstanding 401.5 422.4 428.6 Diluted per share $ 7.63 $ 6.63 $ 4.35 All stock options outstanding were included in the computation during 2012, 2011 and 2010, except 1.8 million options in 2012, none in 2011 and 1.9 million options in 2010 that had an antidilutive effect under the treasury stock method.
24. STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS The company issues stock options and restricted stock awards to key employees under plans approved by stockholders. Restricted stock is also issued to nonemployee directors for their services as directors under a plan approved by stockholders. Options are awarded with the exercise price equal to the market price and become exercisable in one to three years after grant. Options expire ten years after the date of grant. Restricted stock awards generally vest after three years. The compensation cost for stock options, service based restricted stock units and market/service based restricted stock units, which is based on the fair value at the grant date, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite period the employee is required to render service. The compensation cost for performance/service based units, which is based on the fair value at the grant date, is recognized over the employees requisite service period and periodically adjusted for the probable number of shares to be awarded. According to these plans at October31, 2012, the company is authorized to grant an additional 13.7 million shares related to stock options or restricted stock.
54 Table of Contents The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using a binomial lattice option valuation model. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from traded call options on the companys stock. The expected volatilities are constructed from the following three components: the starting implied volatility of short-term call options traded within a few days of the valuation date; the predicted implied volatility of long-term call options; and the trend in implied volatilities over the span of the call options time to maturity. The company uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior and employee termination within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rates utilized for periods throughout the contractual life of the options are based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of grant.
The assumptions used for the binomial lattice model to determine the fair value of options follow: 2012 2011 2010 Risk-free interest rate .01% - 2.0% .08% - 3.3% .01% - 3.6% Expected dividends 1.9% 1.9% 2.9% Expected volatility 34.1% - 41.9% 34.4% - 34.6% 35.3% - 47.2% Weighted-average volatility 33.6% 34.4% 35.6% Expected term (in years) 6.8 - 7.8 6.8 - 7.8 6.6 - 7.7 Stock option activity at October31, 2012 and changes during 2012 in millions of dollars and shares follow: Remaining Contractual Aggregate Exercise Term Intrinsic Shares Price* (Years) Value Outstanding at beginning of year 16.9 $ 51.70 Granted 2.5 74.24 Exercised (1.8 ) 33.33 Expired or forfeited (.2 ) 74.51 Outstanding at end of year 17.4 56.78 5.96 $ 500.2 Exercisable at end of year 12.8 51.58 5.08 432.5 * Weighted-averages The weighted-average grant-date fair values of options granted during 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $22.51, $25.61 and $15.71, respectively. The total intrinsic values of options exercised during 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $88 million, $231 million and $139 million, respectively. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, cash received from stock option exercises was $61 million, $170 million and $129 million with tax benefits of $33 million, $85 million and $51 million, respectively.
The company granted 266 thousand and 222 thousand restricted stock units to employees and nonemployee directors in 2012 and 2011, of which 122 thousand and 92 thousand are subject to service based only conditions, 72 thousand and 65 thousand are subject to performance/service based conditions and 72 thousand and 65 thousand are subject to market/service based conditions, respectively. The service based only units award one share of common stock for each unit at the end of the vesting period and include dividend equivalent payments. The performance/service based units are subject to a performance metric based on the companys compound annual revenue growth rate, compared to a benchmark group of companies over the vesting period. The market/service based units are subject to a market related metric based on total shareholder return, compared to the same benchmark group of companies over the vesting period. The performance/service based units and the market/service based units both award common stock in a range of zero to 200 percent for each unit granted based on the level of the metric achieved and do not include dividend equivalent payments over the vesting period. The weighted-average fair values of the service based only units at the grant dates during 2012 and 2011 were $75.27 and $81.90 per unit, respectively, based on the market price of a share of underlying common stock. The fair value of the performance/service based units at the grant date during 2012 and 2011 were $70.14 and $76.17 per unit, respectively, based on the market price of a share of underlying common stock excluding dividends. The fair value of the market/service based units at the grant date during 2012 and 2011 were $92.85 and $107.31 per unit, respectively, based on a lattice valuation model excluding dividends.
The companys nonvested restricted shares at October31, 2012 and changes during 2012 in millions of shares follow: Grant-Date Shares FairValue* Service based only Nonvested at beginning of year .6 $ 49.91 Granted .1 75.27 Vested (.3 ) 41.59 Nonvested at end of year .4 66.55 Performance/service and market/service   based Nonvested at beginning of year .1 $ 91.74 Granted .2 81.50 Nonvested at end of year .3 86.39 * Weighted-averages During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the total share-based compensation expense was $75 million, $69 million and $71 million, respectively, with recognized income tax benefits of $28 million, $26 million and $26 million, respectively. At October31, 2012, there was $36 million of total unrecognized compensation cost from share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans, which is related to nonvested shares. This compensation is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two years. The total grant-date fair values of stock options and restricted shares vested during 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $76 million, $72 million and $71 million, respectively.
55 Table of Contents The company currently uses shares that have been repurchased through its stock repurchase programs to satisfy share option exercises. At October31, 2012, the company had 149 million shares in treasury stock and 29 million shares remaining to be repurchased under its current publicly announced repurchase program (see Note 23).

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The fair values of financial instruments that do not approximate the carrying values at October31 in millions of dollars follow: 2012 2011 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair Value Value* Value Value Financing receivables  net $ 22,159 $ 22,244 $ 19,924 $ 19,919 Financing receivables securitized  net $ 3,618 $ 3,615 $ 2,905 $ 2,907 Short-term securitization borrowings $ 3,575 $ 3,584 $ 2,777 $ 2,789 Long-term borrowings due within one year: Equipment operations $ 195 $ 194 $ 244 $ 233 Financial services 4,790 4,871 5,249 5,331 Total $ 4,985 $ 5,065 $ 5,493 $ 5,564 Long-term borrowings: Equipment operations $ 5,445 $ 6,237 $ 3,167 $ 3,771 Financial services 17,008 17,438 13,793 14,154 Total $ 22,453 $ 23,675 $ 16,960 $ 17,925 * Fair value measurements above were Level 3 for all financing receivables and Level 2 for all borrowings.
Fair values of the financing receivables that were issued long-term were based on the discounted values of their related cash flows at interest rates currently being offered by the company for similar financing receivables. The fair values of the remaining financing receivables approximated the carrying amounts.
Fair values of long-term borrowings and short-term securitization borrowings were based on current market quotes for identical or similar borrowings and credit risk, or on the discounted values of their related cash flows at current market 56 Table of Contents interest rates. Certain long-term borrowings have been swapped to current variable interest rates. The carrying values of these long-term borrowings included adjustments related to fair value hedges.
Assets and liabilities measured at October31 at fair value on a recurring basis in millions of dollars follow: 2012* 2011* Marketable securities U.S. government debt securities $ 1,200 $ 576 Municipal debt securities 38 36 Corporate debt securities 110 89 Mortgage-backed securities** 122 86 Total marketable securities 1,470 787 Other assets Derivatives: Interest rate contracts 609 471 Foreign exchange contracts 17 12 Cross-currency interest rate contracts 11 2 Total assets*** $ 2,107 $ 1,272 Accounts payable and accrued expenses Derivatives: Interest rate contracts $ 72 $ 61 Foreign exchange contracts 18 100 Cross-currency interest rate contracts 59 7 Total liabilities $ 149 $ 168 * All measurements above were Level 2 measurements except for Level 1 measurements of U.S. government debt securities of $1,139 million and $540 million at October31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
** Primarily issued by U.S. government sponsored enterprises.
*** Excluded from this table are cash equivalents, which are carried at cost that approximates fair value. The cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds.
Fair value, nonrecurring, Level 3 measurements at October31 in millions of dollars follow: FairValue* Losses 2012 2011 2012 2011 2010 Financing receivables** $ 5 $ 1 $ 5 Goodwill $ 33 $ 27 Property and equipment held for sale*** $ 35 * Does not include cost to sell.

Level 1 measurements consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 measurements include significant other observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets; observable inputs such as interest rates and yield curves; and other market-corroborated inputs. Level 3 measurements include significant unobservable inputs.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the company uses various methods including market and income approaches. The company utilizes valuation models and techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs. The models are industry-standard models that consider various assumptions including time values and yield curves as well as other economic measures. These valuation techniques are consistently applied.
The following is a description of the valuation methodologies the company uses to measure certain financial instruments on the balance sheet and nonmonetary assets at fair value: Marketable Securities The portfolio of investments is primarily valued on a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, credit risk and prepayment speeds.
Derivatives The companys derivative financial instruments consist of interest rate swaps and caps, foreign currency forwards and swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps. The portfolio is valued based on an income approach (discounted cash flow) using market observable inputs, including swap curves and both forward and spot exchange rates for currencies.
Financing Receivables Specific reserve impairments are based on the fair value of the collateral, which is measured using a market approach (appraisal values or realizable values). Inputs include a selection of realizable values.
Goodwill The impairment of goodwill is based on the implied fair value measured as the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of the units identifiable net assets. An estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by an income approach (discounted cash flows), which includes inputs such as interest rates.
Property and Equipment Held for Sale The impairment of long-lived assets held for sale is measured at the lower of the carrying amount, or fair value less cost to sell. Fair value is based on the probable sale price. The inputs include estimates of final sale price adjustments.
27. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS Certain of the companys derivative agreements contain credit support provisions that require the company to post collateral based on reductions in credit ratings. The aggregate fair value of all derivatives with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position at October31, 2012 and 2011 was $32 million and $23 million, respectively. The company, due to its credit rating and amounts of net liability position, has not posted any collateral. If the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered, the company would be required to post full collateral for any liability position, prior to considering applicable netting provisions.
57 Table of Contents Derivative instruments are subject to significant concentrations of credit risk to the banking sector. The company manages individual counterparty exposure by setting limits that consider the credit rating of the counterparty and the size of other financial commitments and exposures between the company and the counterparty banks. All interest rate derivatives are transacted under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) documentation. Some of these agreements include credit support provisions. Each master agreement permits the net settlement of amounts owed in the event of default. The maximum amount of loss that the company would incur if counterparties to derivative instruments fail to meet their obligations, not considering collateral received or netting arrangements, was $637 million and $485 million as of October31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The amount of collateral received at October31, 2012 and 2011 to offset this potential maximum loss was $102 million and $25 million, respectively. The netting provisions of the agreements would reduce the maximum amount of loss the company would incur if the counterparties to derivative instruments fail to meet their obligations by an additional $92 million and $59 million as of October31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. None of the concentrations of risk with any individual counterparty was considered significant at October31, 2012 and 2011.
Cash Flow Hedges Certain interest rate and cross-currency interest rate contracts (swaps) were designated as hedges of future cash flows from borrowings. The total notional amounts of the receive-variable/pay-fixed interest rate contracts at October31, 2012 and 2011 were $2,850 million and $1,350 million, respectively. The total notional amounts of the cross-currency interest rate contracts were $923 million and $853 million at October31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The effective portions of the fair value gains or losses on these cash flow hedges were recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and subsequently reclassified into interest expense or other operating expenses (foreign exchange) in the same periods during which the hedged transactions affected earnings. These amounts offset the effects of interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate changes on the related borrowings. Any ineffective portions of the gains or losses on all cash flow interest rate contracts designated as cash flow hedges were recognized currently in interest expense or other operating expenses (foreign exchange) and were not material during any years presented. The cash flows from these contracts were recorded in operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows.
The amount of loss recorded in OCI at October31, 2012 that is expected to be reclassified to interest expense or other operating expenses in the next twelve months if interest rates or exchange rates remain unchanged is approximately $10 million after-tax. These contracts mature in up to 71 months. There were no gains or losses reclassified from OCI to earnings based on the probability that the original forecasted transaction would not occur.
Fair Value Hedges Certain interest rate contracts (swaps) were designated as fair value hedges of borrowings. The total notional amounts of the receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate contracts at October31, 2012 and 2011 were $9,266 million and $7,730 million, respectively. The effective portions of the fair value gains or losses on these contracts were offset by fair value gains or losses on the hedged items (fixed-rate borrowings). Any ineffective portions of the gains or losses were recognized currently in interest expense. The ineffective portions were a loss of $2 million in 2012 and a loss of $5 million in 2011. The cash flows from these contracts were recorded in operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows.
The gains (losses) on these contracts and the underlying borrowings recorded in interest expense follow in millions of dollars: 2012 2011 Interest rate contracts* $ 180 $ 16 Borrowings** (182 ) (21 ) * Includes changes in fair values of interest rate contracts excluding net accrued interest income of $155 million and $172 million during 2012 and 2011, respectively.
** Includes adjustments for fair values of hedged borrowings excluding accrued interest expense of $282 million and $277 million during 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments The company has certain interest rate contracts (swaps and caps), foreign exchange contracts (forwards and swaps) and cross-currency interest rate contracts (swaps), which were not formally designated as hedges. These derivatives were held as economic hedges for underlying interest rate or foreign currency exposures primarily for certain borrowings and purchases or sales of inventory. The total notional amounts of the interest rate swaps at October31, 2012 and 2011 were $4,400 million and $3,216 million, the foreign exchange contracts were $3,999 million and $3,058 million and the cross-currency interest rate contracts were $78 million and $52 million, respectively. At October31, 2012 and 2011, there were also $1,445 million and $1,402 million, respectively, of interest rate caps purchased and the same amounts sold at the same capped interest rate to facilitate borrowings through securitization of retail notes. The fair value gains or losses from the interest rate contracts were recognized currently in interest expense and the gains or losses from foreign exchange contracts in cost of sales or other operating expenses, generally offsetting over time the expenses on the exposures being hedged. The cash flows from these non-designated contracts were recorded in operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows.

28. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA DATA FOR THE YEARS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 The companys operations are presently organized and reported in three major business segments described as follows: The agriculture and turf segment primarily manufactures and distributes a full line of agriculture and turf equipment and related service parts  including large, medium and utility tractors; loaders; combines, corn pickers, cotton and sugarcane harvesters and related front-end equipment and sugarcane loaders; tillage, seeding and application equipment, including sprayers, nutrient management and soil preparation machinery; hay and forage equipment, including self-propelled forage harvesters and attachments, balers and mowers; turf and utility equipment, including riding lawn equipment and walk-behind mowers, golf course equipment, utility vehicles, and commercial mowing equipment, along with a broad line of associated implements; integrated agricultural management systems technology; precision agricultural irrigation equipment and supplies; landscape and nursery products; and other outdoor power products.
The construction and forestry segment primarily manufactures and distributes a broad range of machines and service parts used in construction, earthmoving, material handling and timber harvesting  including backhoe loaders; crawler dozers and loaders; four-wheel-drive loaders; excavators; motor graders; articulated dump trucks; landscape loaders; skid-steer loaders; and log skidders, feller bunchers, log loaders, log forwarders, log harvesters and related attachments.
The products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets.
The financial services segment primarily finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the financial services segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, finances retail revolving charge accounts and operating loans and offers crop risk mitigation products and extended equipment warranties.
Because of integrated manufacturing operations and common administrative and marketing support, a substantial number of allocations must be made to determine operating segment and geographic area data. Intersegment sales and revenues represent sales of components and finance charges, which are generally based on market prices.
59 Table of Contents Information relating to operations by operating segment in millions of dollars follows. In addition to the following unaffiliated sales and revenues by segment, intersegment sales and revenues in 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: agriculture and turf net sales of $84 million, $98 million and $59 million, construction and forestry net sales of $1 million, $3 million and $7 million, and financial services revenues of $219 million, $210 million and $224 million, respectively.

65 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Deere& Company: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Deere& Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of October31, 2012 and 2011, and the related statements of consolidated income, changes in consolidated stockholders equity, and consolidated cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October31, 2012. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index under PartIV,Item 15(2). We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of October31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
66 Table of Contents A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October31, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission .
