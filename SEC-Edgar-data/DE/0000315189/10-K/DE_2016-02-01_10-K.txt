BUSINESS.
Products Deere& Company (the Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, John Deere) have operations that are categorized into three major business segments.
The agriculture and turf segment primarily manufactures and distributes a full line of agriculture and turf equipment and related service parts  including large, medium and utility tractors; loaders; combines, corn pickers, cotton and sugarcane harvesters and related front-end equipment and sugarcane loaders; tillage, seeding and application equipment, including sprayers, nutrient management and soil preparation machinery; hay and forage equipment, including self-propelled forage harvesters and attachments, balers and mowers; turf and utility equipment, including riding lawn equipment and walk-behind mowers, golf course equipment, utility vehicles, and commercial mowing equipment, along with a broad line of associated implements; integrated agricultural management systems technology and solutions; and other outdoor power products.
The construction and forestry segment primarily manufactures and distributes a broad range of machines and service parts used in construction, earthmoving, material handling and timber harvesting  including backhoe loaders; crawler dozers and loaders; four-wheel-drive loaders; excavators; motor graders; articulated dump trucks; landscape loaders; skid-steer loaders; and log skidders, feller bunchers, log loaders, log forwarders, log harvesters and related attachments.
The products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets.
The financial services segment primarily finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the financial services segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, finances retail revolving charge accounts and offers extended equipment warranties.
John Deeres worldwide agriculture and turf operations and construction and forestry operations are sometimes collectively referred to as the equipment operations. The financial services segment is sometimes referred to as the financial services operations.
Additional information is presented in the discussion of business segment and geographic area results on page22. The John Deere enterprise has manufactured agricultural machinery since 1837. The present Company was incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1958.
The Companys internet address is http://www.JohnDeere.com . Through that address, the Companys annual report on Form10-K, quarterly reports on Form10-Q, current reports on Form8-K and amendments to those reports are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Securities and Exchange Commission or Commission). The information contained on the Companys website is not included in, or incorporated by reference into, this annual report on Form10-K.
Market Conditions and Outlook The Companys equipment sales are projected to decrease about 7 percent for fiscal year 2016 and decrease about 11 percent for the first quarter, compared with the same periods of 2015. For fiscal year 2016, net income attributable to Deere& Company is anticipated to be about $1.4 billion.
Agriculture& Turf.
The Companys agriculture and turf equipment sales are forecast to decrease by about 8 percent for 2016. Industry agricultural machinery sales in the U.S. and Canada for 2016 are forecast to decrease 15 to 20 percent, compared to 2015. Industry sales in the European Union (EU)28 nations are forecast to be approximately the same to 5 percent lower in 2016, while South American industry sales are projected to decrease about 10 to 15 percent from 2015 levels. Asian sales are projected to be about the same or decrease slightly in 2016.
Industry sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be approximately the same to 5 percent higher.
Construction& Forestry.
The Companys construction and forestry sales decreased 9 percent in 2015 and are forecast to decrease about 5 percent in 2016.
The decrease in sales reflects the impact of weak conditions in the North American energy sector, especially in Canada, as well as lower sales outside the U.S. and Canada. Global forestry industry sales are expected to decrease about 5 to 10 percent from last years strong levels, primarily as a result of lower sales in the U.S. and Canada.
2 Financial Services.
Fiscal-year 2016 net income attributable to Deere& Company for the financial services operations is expected to be approximately $550 million. The outlook reflects a decline from 2015 due primarily to less favorable financing spreads and an increased provision for credit losses. Additionally, 2015 results benefited from a gain on the sale of the crop insurance business.
2015 Consolidated Results Compared with 2014 Worldwide net income attributable to Deere& Company in 2015 was $1,940 million, or $5.77 per share diluted ($5.81basic), compared with $3,162 million, or $8.63 per share diluted ($8.71 basic), in 2014. Net sales and revenues decreased 20 percent to $28,863 million in 2015, compared with $36,067 million in 2014. Net sales of the worldwide equipment operations declined 22 percent in 2015 to $25,775 million from $32,961 million last year. Sales included price realization of 1 percent and an unfavorable currency translation effect of 5 percent. Equipment net sales in the United States and Canada decreased 18 percent for 2015. Outside the U.S. and Canada, net sales decreased 28 percent for the year, with an unfavorable currency translation effect of 10 percent for 2015.
Worldwide equipment operations had an operating profit of $2,177 million in 2015, compared with $4,297 million in 2014. The operating profit decline was due primarily to lower shipment volumes, the impact of a less favorable product mix and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange. These factors were partially offset by price realization, lower selling, administrative and general expenses and lower production costs.
Net income of the companys equipment operations was $1,308 million for 2015, compared with $2,548 million in 2014. In addition to the operating factors mentioned above, a lower effective tax rate benefited the results. The lower rate resulted mainly from a reduction of a valuation allowance recorded during the fourth quarter due to a change in the expected realizable value of a deferred tax asset.
Net income of the financial services operations attributable to Deere& Company in 2015 increased to $633 million, compared with $624 million in 2014. Results improved due to growth in the average credit portfolio, the previously announced crop insurance sale and higher crop insurance margins experienced prior to divestiture (see Note 4), and lower selling, administrative and general expenses. These factors were partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange translation, less favorable financing spreads and higher losses on residual values primarily for construction equipment operating leases. The results in 2014 also benefited from a more favorable effective tax rate. Additional information is presented in the following discussion of the Worldwide Financial Services Operations.
The cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2015 was 78.1 percent, compared with 75.2 percent last year. The increase was due primarily to the impact of a less favorable product mix and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange, partially offset by price realization and lower production costs.
Additional information on 2015 results is presented on pages21-23.
EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS Agriculture and Turf The John Deere agriculture and turf segment manufactures and distributes a full line of agriculture and turf equipment and related service parts. Under the segments global operating model, the segment consolidates all markets into four geographical customer focus areas to facilitate deep customer understanding and deliver better customer service. The segments equipment operations are consolidated into five product platforms  crop harvesting (combines, corn pickers, cotton and sugarcane harvesters and related front-end equipment and sugarcane loaders); turf and utility (utility vehicles, riding lawn equipment, walk-behind mowers, commercial mowing equipment, golf course equipment, implements for mowing, tilling, snow and debris handling, aerating and many other residential, commercial, golf and sports turf care applications and other outdoor power products); hay and forage (self-propelled forage harvesters and attachments, balers and mowers); crop care (tillage, seeding and application equipment, including sprayers, nutrient management and soil preparation machinery); and tractors (loaders and large, medium and utility tractors and related attachments). John Deere also purchases certain products from other manufacturers for resale.
The segment also provides integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems. John Deere has developed a comprehensive agricultural management systems approach using advanced communications, data collection and global satellite positioning technologies to enable farmers to better control input costs and yields, improve soil conservation, minimize chemical use, and to gather information. John Deeres advanced telematics systems remotely connect agricultural equipment owners, business managers and dealers to agricultural equipment in the field, providing real-time alerts and information about equipment location, utilization, performance and maintenance to improve productivity and efficiency.
In addition to the John Deere brand, the agriculture and turf segment purchases and sells a variety of equipment attachments under the Frontier, Kemper and Green Systems brand names, and manufactures and sells walk-behind mowers and scarifiers in select European countries under the SABO brand name. John Deere manufactures its agriculture and turf equipment for sale primarily through independent retail dealer networks, and also builds products for sale by mass retailers, including The Home Depot and Lowes.
3 Sales of agricultural equipment are affected by total farm cash receipts, which reflect levels of farm commodity prices, acreage planted, crop yields and government policies, including the amount and timing of government payments. Sales are also influenced by general economic conditions, farm land prices, farmers debt levels and access to financing, interest and exchange rates, agricultural trends, including the production of and demand for renewable fuels, labor availability and costs, energy costs, tax policies and other input costs associated with farming. Other important factors affecting new agricultural equipment sales are the value and level of used equipment, including tractors, harvesting equipment, self-propelled sprayers, hay and forage equipment and seeding equipment. Weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of agricultural equipment purchasers.
Innovations in machinery and technology also influence agricultural equipment purchasing. For example, larger, more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations. Large, cost-efficient, highly-mechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output. The large-size agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to John Deere. A large proportion of the equipment operations total agricultural equipment sales in the U.S. and Canada, and a significant proportion of sales in many countries outside the U.S. and Canada, comprises tractors over 100 horsepower, self-propelled combines, self-propelled cotton pickers, self-propelled forage harvesters, self-propelled sprayers and seeding equipment. However, John Deeres sales of small tractors below 100 horsepower are increasing, and John Deere offers a number of harvesting solutions to support development of the mechanized harvesting of grain, oilseeds, cotton, sugar and biomass.
Retail sales of lawn and garden tractors, compact utility tractors, residential and commercial mowers, utility vehicles, and golf and turf equipment are influenced by weather conditions, consumer spending patterns and general economic conditions.
Seasonality . Seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during the year. Seasonal demand must be estimated in advance, and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year. For certain equipment, John Deere offers early order discounts to retail customers. Production schedules are based, in part, on these early order programs. The segment incurs substantial seasonal variation in cash flows to finance production and inventory of agricultural equipment. The segment also incurs costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand. New combine and cotton harvesting equipment has been sold under early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to customers who take delivery of machines during off-season periods. In Australia, Canada and the U.S., there are typically several used equipment trade-in transactions as part of most new agricultural equipment sales. To provide support to its dealers for these used equipment trade-ins, John Deere provides dealers in these countries with a pool of funds, awarded to dealers as a percentage of the dealer cost for eligible new equipment sales. Dealers can use these funds to defray the costs of carrying or marketing used equipment inventory or to provide financing incentives to customers purchasing the used equipment.
Retail demand for turf and utility equipment is normally higher in the second and third fiscal quarters. John Deere has pursued a strategy of building and shipping such equipment as close to retail demand as possible. Consequently, to increase asset turnover and reduce the average level of field inventories through the year, production and shipment schedules of these product lines are normally proportionately higher in the second and third fiscal quarters of each year, corresponding closely to the seasonal pattern of retail sales.
Construction and Forestry John Deeres construction and forestry equipment includes a broad range of backhoe loaders, crawler dozers and loaders, four-wheel-drive loaders, excavators, motor graders, articulated dump trucks, landscape loaders, skid-steer loaders, log skidders, log feller bunchers, log loaders, log forwarders, log harvesters and a variety of attachments. John Deere provides a broad line of construction equipment and the most complete line of forestry machines and attachments available in the world. The construction and forestry machines are distributed under the John Deere brand name, and forestry attachments are distributed under the John Deere and Waratah brand names. In addition to the equipment manufactured by the construction and forestry segment, John Deere purchases certain products from other manufacturers for resale. The segment also provides comprehensive fleet management telematics solutions designed to improve customer productivity and efficiency through access to fleet location, utilization and maintenance information.
The prevailing levels of residential, commercial and public construction and the condition of the forestry products industry influence retail sales of John Deere construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry equipment. General economic conditions, the level of interest rates, the availability of credit and certain commodity prices such as those applicable to pulp, paper and saw logs also influence sales.
4 Pursuant to agreements between John Deere and Bell Equipment Limited (Bell), Belllicenses John Deere to manufacture articulated dump trucksin the U.S. for John Deeres distribution under the John Deere brand name inNorth, Central and South America. John Deere licenses Bell to manufacture and sell certain John Deere-designed construction equipment in specified territories of Africa.Bell is also the distributor of certain John Deere-manufactured construction equipment under the Bellbrand and forestry equipment under the John Deerebrand in certain territories of Africa. Bell and John Deere have agreed to terminate the articulated dump truck manufacturing and license agreements in the coming year.
John Deere and Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. (Hitachi) have a joint venture for the manufacture of hydraulic excavators and tracked forestry equipment and loaders in the U.S. and Canada and a joint venture for the manufacture of excavators in Brazil. John Deere distributes Hitachi brands of construction and mining equipment in North, Central and South America. John Deere also has supply agreements with Hitachi under which a range of construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry equipment manufactured by John Deere in the U.S., Finland and New Zealand is distributed by Hitachi in certain Asian markets. The division has also established manufacturing capacity for construction equipment in China and Brazil.
The segment has a number of initiatives in the rent-to-rent, or short-term rental, market for construction, earthmoving and material handling equipment. These include specially designed rental programs for John Deere dealers and expanded cooperation with major, national equipment rental companies.
John Deere also owns Nortrax,Inc. that in turn owns Nortrax Canada Inc. that in turn owns Nortrax Quebec Inc. (collectively called Nortrax). Nortrax is an authorized John Deere dealer for construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry equipment in a variety of markets in the U.S. and Canada. John Deere also owns retail forestry sales operations in Australia, Brazil, Finland,Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
Competition The equipment operations sell products and services into a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets. The principal competitive factors in all markets include product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, customer service and price.In North America and many other parts of the world, John Deeres brand recognition is a competitive factor.
The competitive environment for the agriculture and turf segment includes some global competitors, including AGCO Corporation, CLAAS KGaA mbH, CNH Global N.V., Kubota Tractor Corporation and The Toro Company and many regional and local competitors.These competitors have varying numbers of product lines competing with the segments products and each has varying degrees of regional focus. An important part of the competition within the agricultural equipment industry during the past decade has come from a variety of short-line and specialty manufacturers, as well as indigenous regional competitors, with differing manufacturing and marketing methods. Because of industry conditions, including the merger of certain large integrated competitors and the emergence and expanding global capability of many competitors, particularly in emerging and high potential markets such as Brazil, China and India where John Deere seeks to increase market share, the agricultural equipment business continues to undergo significant change and is becoming even more competitive. The segments turf equipment is sold primarily in the highly competitive North American and Western European markets.
The construction and forestry segment operates in highly competitive North American and global markets, including Brazil, China,India and Russia. Global competitors of the construction and forestry segment include CaterpillarInc., Komatsu Ltd., Volvo Construction Equipment (part of Volvo Group AB), CNH Global N.V., Tigercat Industries Inc. and Ponsse Plc. The segment manufactures construction, earthmoving and material handling equipment for over 90 percent of the types of construction equipment used in the U.S. and Canada.
Engineering and Research John Deere invests heavily in engineering and research to improve the quality and performance of its products, to develop new products and to comply with government regulations. Such expenditures were $1,425 million, or 5.5 percent of net sales, in 2015, $1,452 million, or 4.4 percent of net sales, in 2014 and $1,477 million, or 4.2 percent of net sales, in 2013.
Manufacturing Manufacturing Plants . In the U.S. and Canada, the equipment operations own and operate 20 factory locations and lease and operate another two locations, which contain approximately 28.3 million square feet of floor space. Of these 22 factories, 13 are devoted primarily to agriculture and turf equipment, four to construction and forestry equipment, one to engines, two to engine and component remanufacturing and two to hydraulic and power train components. Outside the U.S. and Canada, the equipment operations own or lease and operate: agriculture and turf equipment factories in Brazil, China, France, Germany,India,Israel, Mexico, the Netherlands, Russia and Spain; construction equipment factories in Brazil and China; engine factories in Argentina, China, France,India and Mexico; and forestry equipment factories in Finland and New Zealand. These factories and manufacturing 5 operations outside the U.S. and Canada contain approximately 19.8 million square feet of floor space. The engine factories referred to above manufacture non-road, heavy duty diesel engines, a majority of which are manufactured for John Deeres equipment operations. The remaining engines are sold to other regional and global original equipment manufacturers.
The equipment operations also have financial interests in other manufacturing organizations, which include agricultural equipment manufacturers in the U.S., Bell in South Africa, the Hitachi joint venture that builds hydraulic excavators and track log loaders in the U.S. and Canada and the Hitachi joint venture that builds hydraulic excavators in Brazil, and ventures that manufacture transaxles and transmissions used in certain agriculture and turf segment products.
John Deeres facilities are well maintained, in good operating condition and suitable for their present purposes. These facilities, together with both short-term and long-term planned capital expenditures, are expected to meet John Deeres manufacturing needs in the foreseeable future.
Existing capacity is sufficient to satisfy John Deeres current expectations for retail market demand. The equipment operations manufacturing strategy involves the implementation of appropriate levels of technology and automation to allow manufacturing processes to remain profitable at varying production levels. Operations are also designed to be flexible enough to accommodate the product design changes required to meet market conditions and changing customer requirements. Common manufacturing facilities and techniques are employed in the production of components for agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment.
In order to utilize manufacturing facilities and technology more effectively, the equipment operations pursue continuous improvements in manufacturing processes. These include steps to streamline manufacturing processes and enhance responsiveness to customers. John Deere has implemented flexible assembly lines that can accommodate a wider product mix and deliver products in line with dealer and customer demand. Additionally, considerable effort is being directed to manufacturing cost reduction through process improvement, product design, advanced manufacturing technology, enhanced environmental management systems, supply management and logistics as well as compensation incentives related to productivity and organizational structure. In past years, John Deere has experienced volatility in the price of many raw materials. John Deere has responded to cost pressures by implementing the cost-reduction measures described above and by increasing prices. Significant cost increases, if they occur, could have an adverse effect on the Companys operating results. The equipment operations also pursue external sales of selected parts and components that can be manufactured and supplied to third parties on a competitive basis.
Capital Expenditures.
The equipment operations capital expenditures totaled $649 million in 2015, compared with $1,001 million in 2014 and $1,129 million in 2013. Provisions for depreciation applicable to these operations property and equipment during these years were $687 million, $690 million and $630 million, respectively. Capital expenditures for the equipment operations in 2016 are currently estimated to be approximately $800 million. The 2016 expenditures will relate primarily to the modernization and restructuring of key manufacturing facilities, U.S. Tier 4 emission requirements and the development of new products. Future levels of capital expenditures will depend on business conditions.
Patents and Trademarks John Deere owns a significant number of patents, trade secrets, licenses and trademarks related to John Deere products and services, and expects the number to grow as John Deere continues to pursue technological innovations. John Deeres policy is to further its competitive position by filing patent applications in the U.S. and internationally to protect technology and improvements considered important to the business. John Deere believes that, in the aggregate, the rights under these patents and licenses are generally important to its operations and competitive position, but does not regard any of its businesses as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents. However, certain John Deere trademarks, which contribute to John Deeres identity and the recognition of its products and services, including but not limited to the John Deere mark, the leaping deer logo, the Nothing Runs Like a Deere slogan, the prefix JD associated with many products and green and yellow equipment colors, are an integral part of John Deeres business, and their loss could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Marketing In the U.S. and Canada, the equipment operations distribute equipment and service parts through the following facilities: two agriculture and turf equipment sales and administration offices located in Olathe, Kansas and Cary, North Carolina and one sales branch located in Grimsby, Ontario; and one construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry equipment sales and administration office located in Moline,Illinois. In addition, the equipment operations operate a centralized parts distribution warehouse in coordination with eight regional parts depots and distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada.
Through these U.S. and Canadian facilities, John Deere markets products to approximately 2,381 dealer locations, most of which are independently owned and operated. Of these, approximately 1,522 sell agricultural equipment, while approximately 427 sell 6 construction, earthmoving, material handling and/or forestry equipment. Nortrax owns some of the 427 dealer locations. Turf equipment is sold at most John Deere agricultural equipment locations, a few construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry equipment locations and about 432 turf-only locations, many of which also sell dissimilar lines of non-John Deere products. In addition, certain lawn and garden product lines are sold through The Home Depot and Lowes.
Outside the U.S. and Canada, John Deere agriculture and turf equipment is sold to distributors and dealers for resale in over 100 countries. Sales and administrative offices are located in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany,India,Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Kingdom and an administrative office is located in Kenya. Associated companies doing business in China also sell agricultural equipment. Turf equipment sales outside the U.S. and Canada occur primarily in Europe and Australia. Construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry equipment is sold to distributors and dealers primarily by sales offices located in Australia, Brazil, Finland,Ireland, New Zealand, Russia and Singapore. Some of these dealers are independently owned while John Deere owns others. The equipment operations operate centralized parts distribution warehouses in Brazil, Germany,India and Russia in coordination with regional parts depots and distribution centers in Argentina, Australia, China,Mexico, South Africa, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
John Deere engines are marketed worldwide through select sales branches to large original equipment manufacturers and independently owned engine distributors.
Raw Materials John Deere purchases raw materials and some manufactured components and replacement parts for its equipment, engines and other products from leading suppliers both domestically and internationally. These materials and components include a variety of steel products, steel and iron castings, forgings, plastics, electronics and ready-to-assemble components made to certainspecifications. John Deere also purchases various goods and services used in production, logistics, offices and research and development processes. John Deere maintains strategic sourcing models to meet its production needs andbuild uponlong-term supplier relationships. John Deere uses a variety of agreements with suppliers intended to drive innovation, ensure availability and delivery of industry-leading quality raw materials and components, manage costs on a globally competitive basis, protect John Deeres intellectual property and minimize other supply-related risks. Supply chain risks monitored by John Deere to minimize the likelihood of the supply base causing business disruption include supplier financial viability, capacity, business continuity, quality and delivery and weather-related events including natural disasters. In fiscal year 2015, John Deere experienced no significant work stoppagesas a result of shortages of raw materials or other commodities.
Backlog Orders The dollar amount of backlog orders for the agriculture and turf segment believed to be firm was approximately $2.4 billion at October31, 2015, compared with $3.9 billion at October31, 2014. The agriculture and turf backlog is generally highest in the second and third quarters due to seasonal buying trends in these industries. John Deere generally produces and ships its construction and forestry equipment on average within approximately 60 days after an order is deemed to become firm. Therefore, no significant amount of construction and forestry backlog orders accumulates during any period.
Trade Accounts and Notes Receivable Trade accounts and notes receivable arise primarily from sales of goods to independent dealers. Most trade receivables originated by the equipment operations are purchased by the financial services operations. The equipment operations compensate the financial services operations at approximate market rates of interest for these receivables. Additional information appears in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
FINANCIAL SERVICES U.S. and Canada . The financial services segment primarily provides and administers financing for retail purchases from John Deere dealers of new equipment manufactured by John Deeres agriculture and turf and construction and forestry segments and used equipment taken in trade for this equipment.
The Company and John Deere Construction& Forestry Company (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) are referred to as the sales companies. John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation), a U.S. financial services subsidiary, generally purchases retail installment sales and loan contracts (retail notes) from the sales companies. These retail notes are acquired by the sales companies through John Deere retail dealers in the U.S. John Deere Financial Inc., a Canadian financial services subsidiary, purchases and finances retail notes acquired by John Deere Canada ULC, the Companys Canadian sales branch. The terms of retail notes and the basis on which the financial services operations acquire retail notes from the sales companies are governed by agreements with the sales companies. The financial services segment also finances and services revolving charge accounts, in most 7 cases acquired from and offered through merchants in the agriculture and turf and construction and forestry markets (revolving charge accounts). Additionally, the financial services operations provide wholesale financing for inventories of John Deere agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment owned by dealers of those products (wholesale notes). The various financing options offered by the financial services operations are designed to enhance sales of John Deere products and generate financing income for the financial services operations. In the U.S., certain subsidiaries included in the financial services segment offer extended equipment warranties.
Retail notes acquired by the sales companies are immediately sold to the financial services operations. The equipment operations are the financial services operations major source of business, but many retail purchasers of John Deere products finance their purchases outside the John Deere organization through a variety of sources, including commercial banks and finance and leasing companies.
The financial services operations offer retail leases to equipment users in the U.S. A small number of leases are executed with units of local government. Leases are usually written for periods of four months to sixty months, and typically contain an option permitting the customer to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term. Retail leases are also offered in a generally similar manner to customers in Canada through John Deere Financial Inc. and John Deere Canada ULC.
The financial services operations terms for financing equipment retail sales (other than smaller items financed with unsecured revolving charge accounts) generally provide for retention of a security interest in the equipment financed. The financial services operations guidelines for minimum down payments, which vary with the types of equipment and repayment provisions, are generally 10 percent to 30 percent. Finance charges are sometimes waived for specified periods or reduced on certain John Deere products sold or leased in advance of the season of use or in other sales promotions. The financial services operations generally receive compensation from the sales companies at approximate market interest rates for periods during which finance charges are waived or reduced on the retail notes or leases. The cost is accounted for as a deduction in arriving at net sales by the equipment operations.
The Company has an agreement with Capital Corporation to make payments to Capital Corporation such that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than 1.05 to 1 for any fiscal quarter. For 2015 and 2014, Capital Corporations ratios were 3.42 to 1 and 3.81 to 1, respectively, and never less than 3.26 to 1 and 3.32 to 1 for any fiscal quarter of 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company has also committed to continue to own, directly or through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of Capital Corporation and to maintain Capital Corporations consolidated tangible net worth at not less than $50 million. The Companys obligations to make payments to Capital Corporation under the agreement are independent of whether Capital Corporation is in default on its indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Further, the Companys obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of Capital Corporations indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. The Companys obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of any specific indebtedness, obligation or liability of Capital Corporation and are enforceable only by or in the name of Capital Corporation. No payments were required under this agreement in 2015 or 2014.
Outside the U.S. and Canada . The financial services operations also offer financing, primarily for John Deere products, in Australia, Brazil, China,India, New Zealand, Russia, Thailand and in several other countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America. In certain areas, financing is offered through cooperation agreements or joint ventures. The manner in which the financial services operations offer financing in these countries is affected by a variety of country-specific laws, regulations and customs, including those governing property rights and debtor obligations, that are subject to change and that may introduce greater risk to the financial services operations.
The financial services operations also offer to select customers and dealers credit enhanced international export financing for the purchase of John Deere products.
Additional information on the financial services operations appears on pages22, 23, 25 and 27.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS John Deere is subject to a wide variety of local, state and federal environmental laws and regulations in the U.S., as well as the environmental laws and regulations of other countries in which John Deere conducts business. John Deere strives to comply and believes it is in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations. However, failure to comply with these regulations could lead to fines and other penalties. John Deere is involved in the evaluation and clean-up of a limited number of sites but does not expect that these matters or other expenses or liabilities John Deere may incur in connection with any noncompliance with environmental laws or regulations or the cleanup of any additional properties, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows or competitive position of John Deere. With respect 8 to acquired properties and businesses or properties and businesses acquired in the future, John Deere conducts due diligence into potential exposure to environmental liabilities, but cannot be certain that it has identified or will identify all adverse environmental conditions. Compliance with these laws and regulations has added, and will continue to add, to the cost of John Deeres products.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has issued stringent emissions regulations for off-road engines, and governmental agencies throughout the world are similarly enacting more stringent laws to reduce off-road engine emissions. John Deere has achieved and plans to continue to achieve compliance with these regulations through significant investments in the development of new engine technologies and after-treatment systems. Compliance with emissions regulations has added and will continue to add to the cost of John Deeres products.
EMPLOYEES At October31, 2015, John Deere had approximately 57,200 full-time employees, including approximately 28,500 employees in the U.S. and Canada. John Deere also retains consultants, independent contractors, and temporary and part-time workers. Unions are certified as bargaining agents for approximately 82 percent of John Deeres U.S. production and maintenance employees. Approximately 10,000 of John Deeres U.S. production and maintenance workers are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the United Auto Workers (UAW), with an expiration date of October1, 2021.
Unions also represent the majority of employees at John Deere manufacturing facilities outside the U.S.

RISK FACTORS.
The following risks are considered the most significant to John Deeres business based upon current knowledge, information and assumptions. This discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis beginning on page21, including the risks and uncertainties described in the Safe Harbor Statement on pages23 through 24, and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page37. These risk factors and other forward-looking statements that relate to future events, expectations, trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change, and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all of the Companys businesses. Although each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. The Company, except as required by law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factors discussion, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. The risks described in this Annual Report on Form10-K and the Safe Harbor Statement in this report are not the only risks faced by the Company.
10 International, national and regional trade laws, regulations and policies (particularly those related to or restricting global trade) and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair John Deeres profitability and growth prospects.
International, national and regional laws, regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of John Deeres products, services and technology, including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors, could harm John Deeres multinational business and subject John Deere to civil and criminal sanctions. John Deeres profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace. Restricted access to global markets impairs John Deeres ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world, and limits the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis. Trade restrictions could limit John Deeres ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair John Deeres ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products and services. These restrictions may affect John Deeres competitive position. Furthermore, the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to John Deeres agricultural and forestry customers. Policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world. John Deeres agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world. Furthermore, trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living, which could negatively impact John Deeres future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food, fuel and infrastructure. Additionally, changes in government farm programs and policies, including direct payment and other subsidies, can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the US and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales or transactions to specific persons, including financial institutions, or countries or based on product classification expose John Deere to potential criminal and civil sanctions. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws and sanctions, these laws and sanctions, particularly with respect to eastern Europe, are changing rapidly. Violations of these laws could have an adverse effect on John Deeres reputation, business and results of operations and financial condition.
Changes in government banking, monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on John Deere.
Policies of the U.S. and other governments regarding banking, monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity, stabilize financial markets and/or address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on John Deeres customers and markets. John Deeres operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform that could have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on John Deeres customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of John Deere products. Government policies on taxes and spending can also affect John Deere, especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development.
Changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bio-energy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain John Deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements .
Changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the worlds growing food and bio-energy demands, driven in part by government policies and a growing world population, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment. Lower farm commodity prices directly affect farm incomes, which could negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment. While higher commodity prices benefit John Deeres crop-producing agricultural equipment customers, higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers. Furthermore, changing bio-fuel demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise, with corresponding changes in equipment demands. Finally, changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization could affect demand for John Deeres diesel-fueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards.
As John Deere seeks to expand its business globally, growth opportunities may be impacted by greater political, economic and social uncertainty and the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of John Deeres competition, customer base and product offerings.
John Deeres efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in additional geographic markets including but not limited to Brazil, China,India and Russia. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than John Deeres other markets. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes John Deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural 11 practices, business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation, sanctions requirements and repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies. Expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the Companys financial results. As these emerging geographic markets become more important to John Deere, its competitors are also seeking to expand their production capacities and sales in these same markets. While John Deere maintains a positive corporate image and the John Deere brand is widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets, the brand is less well known in some emerging markets which could impede John Deeres efforts to successfully compete in these markets. Although John Deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances, John Deeres reputation and/or business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful.
John Deere operates in highly competitive markets.
John Deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets. John Deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. John Deere competes on the basis of product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, customer service and price. Aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or John Deeres failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect John Deeres business, results of operations and financial condition.
John Deere is subject to extensive anti-corruption laws and regulations.
John Deeres global operations must comply with all applicable laws, which may include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act or other anti-corruption laws. These anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws, violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have an adverse effect on John Deeres reputation, business and results of operations and financial condition.
Negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for John Deeres equipment and services, limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs.
The demand for John Deeres products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment, cautious consumer spending, lower corporate earnings, U.S. budget issues and lower business investment. Negative or uncertain economic conditions causing John Deeres customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing John Deeres equipment. Sustained negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment. John Deeres turf operations and its construction and forestry business are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions. Decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on John Deeres results of operations. If negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy, there could be a similar effect on John Deeres agricultural equipment sales. In addition, uncertain or negative outlook with respect to ongoing U.S. budget issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions. Such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce the Companys earnings and cash flows. Additionally, the Companys investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets, which would negatively affect earnings.
In addition, demand for John Deeres products and services can be significantly reduced by concerns regarding the diverse economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in the eurozone, the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, and the long term stability of the euro as a single common currency. Persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions within the individual countries in the eurozone, and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Companys euro- denominated assets and obligations, have an adverse effect on demand for John Deeres products and services in the eurozone and have an adverse effect on financial markets in Europe and globally. More specifically, it could affect the ability of John Deeres customers, suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses, to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for John Deeres products.
12 The Companys consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries, creating currency translation risk.
John Deere operates in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. John Deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which John Deere earns revenues. Additionally, the reporting currency for the Companys consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of John Deeres assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries currencies. Those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the Companys consolidated financial statements.
Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar could have a significant impact on John Deeres results.
Because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deeres sales worldwide, John Deeres operations and financial results could be impacted materially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry.
In recent years, negative economic conditions have frequently had an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates. The financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deeres sales worldwide. The financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations. The financial services segment may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The financial services segments inability to access funds at cost-effective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on John Deeres business. The financial services segments liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities. Additionally, negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels, resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact the financial services segments write-offs and provision for credit losses.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Act) and the regulations implementing the Act impose additional supervisory, financial and reporting requirements and compliance costs on John Deere and John Deeres financial services operations and could therefore adversely affect John Deere and its financial services segment.
The Act was enacted on July21, 2010 to broadly reform practices in the financial services industry, including equipment financing and securitizations. The Act directs federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and others, to adopt rulesto regulate depository institutions, non-bank financial institutions, thrift holding companies, the consumer finance industry and the capital markets, including certain commercial transactions such as derivatives contracts. Although the effects of the Act on the capital markets and the financial industry are not fully known until all the regulations have been finalized and implemented, the Act and its regulations impose additional reporting requirements, stress testing requirements, leverage, liquidity requirements, capital and other supervisory and financial standards and restrictions that increase regulatory-related compliance costs for John Deere and John Deeres financial services operations and could adversely affect John Deere and its financial services segments funding activities, liquidity, structure (including relationships with affiliates), operations and performance. Moreover, John Deeres operations, including those outside of the United States, will also be impacted by non-U.S. regulatory reforms, including Basel III, being implemented to further regulatenon-U.S. financial institutions and markets.
John Deeres business results depend largely on its ability to understand its customers specific preferences and requirements, and to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demand.
John Deeres ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality, at affordable prices, is critical to its success. This requires a thorough understanding of John Deeres existing and potential customers on a global basis, particularly in potentially high-growth and emerging markets, including Brazil, China,India and Russia. Failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on John Deeres business.
John Deeres business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment.
Poor or unusual weather conditions, particularly during the planting and early growing season, can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of John Deeres customers, particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment. The timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production. Insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields. Excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting 13 from occurring at optimal times, and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth. Temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields, and may also affect disease incidence. Temperature affects the rate of growth, crop maturity and crop quality. Natural calamities such as regional floods, hurricanes or other storms, and droughts can have significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production. The resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment. Sales of turf equipment, particularly during the important spring selling season, can be dramatically impacted by weather. Adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment. Drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes.
Changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials, components and whole goods could result in production disruptions or increased costs and lower profits on sales of John Deere products.
John Deere requires access to various raw materials, components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products. Changes in the availability and price of these raw materials, components and whole goods, which have fluctuated significantly in the past and are more likely to fluctuate during times of economic volatility, can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business, particularly if John Deere, due to pricing considerations or other factors, is unable to recover the increased costs from its customers. John Deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials, components and whole goods required to manufacture its products. Certain components and parts used in John Deeres products are available from a single supplier and cannot be re-sourced quickly. Supply chain disruptions due to supplier financial distress, capacity constraints, business continuity, quality, delivery or disruptions due to weather-related or natural disaster events could affect John Deeres operations and profitability.
John Deeres equipment operations and financial services segment are subject to interest rate risks. Changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment, adversely affect interest margins and limit the ability to access capital markets while increasing borrowing costs.
Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of John Deeres customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for John Deere equipment and customers ability to repay obligations to John Deere. In addition, credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to John Deeres financial services segment because such costs affect the segments ability to offer customers competitive financing rates. In addition, changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Companys net interest rate marginthe difference between the yield the Company earns on its assets and the interest rates the Company pays for funding, which could in turn affect the Companys net interest income and earnings. Actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks, can affect the availability and cost of funding for the Company and can increase the Companys cost of capital and hurt its competitive position.
John Deeres operations, suppliers and customers are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations of federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over John Deeres international operations.
In addition, private civil litigation on these subjects has increased, primarily in the U.S.
Enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental, health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and defense costs, and result in significant fines or penalties. In addition, new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict John Deeres operations, or those of our suppliers and customers, require significant expenditures to achieve compliance and/or give rise to civil or criminal liability. There can be no assurance that violations of such legislation and/or regulations, or private civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental, health or safety impacts of John Deeres operations, or those of our suppliers and customers, would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on John Deeres business, financial condition or results of operations.
Increasingly stringent engine emission standards could impact John Deeres ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment, which could negatively affect business results.
John Deeres equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction standards, including Final Tier 4/Stage IV non-road diesel emission requirements in the U.S. and European Union. In addition, governmental agencies throughout the world are enacting more stringent laws and regulations to reduce off-road engine emissions. These standards are applicable to many engines manufactured by John Deere and used in many models of John Deere agriculture and construction and forestry equipment. John Deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs and is introducing many new equipment models, largely due to the implementation of these more rigorous standards. While John Deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements and does not currently foresee significant obstacles that would 14 prevent timely compliance, these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect John Deeres ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines, which could negatively impact business results.
Security breaches and other disruptions to John Deeres information technology infrastructure could interfere with John Deeres operations and could compromise John Deeres and its customers and suppliers information, exposing John Deere to liability that would cause John Deeres business and reputation to suffer.
In the ordinary course of business, John Deere relies upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of John Deere equipment and from customers of John Deeres financial services operations. John Deere uses information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, John Deere collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of John Deeres customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of John Deeres customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to John Deeres business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, John Deeres information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, terrorist acts or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise John Deeres networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and damage John Deeres reputation, which could adversely affect John Deeres business. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve we may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems.
John Deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and could be further impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities, suppliers and customers.
There is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of Earths atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. These considerations may lead to international, national, regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the future. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, including John Deere, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to John Deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances, facilities improvements and energy costs, which would increase John Deeres operating costs through higher utility, transportation and materials costs. Increased input costs, such as fuel and fertilizer, and compliance-related costs could also impact customer operations and demand for John Deere equipment. Because the impact of any future GHG legislative, regulatory or product standard requirements on John Deeres global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards, John Deere is unable to predict its potential impact at this time.
Furthermore, the potential physical impacts of climate change on John Deeres facilities, suppliers and customers and therefore on John Deeres operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions. These may include long-term changes in temperature levels and water availability. These potential physical effects may adversely impact the demand for John Deeres products and the cost, production, sales and financial performance of John Deeres operations.
Sustained increases in funding obligations under the Companys pension plans may impair the Companys liquidity or financial condition.
The Company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees, which impose on us funding obligations. The Company uses many assumptions in calculating its future payment obligations under the plans. Significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns on pension investments being lower than expected. The Company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future. These factors could significantly increase the Companys payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.
15 The reallocation of radio frequency (RF) spectrums could disrupt or degrade the reliability of John Deeres high precision augmented Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, which could impair John Deeres ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers profitability.
John Deeres current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems, as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment, depend upon the use of RF signals. These signals include, but are not limited to, GPS signals, other GPS-like satellite signals, augmented GPS services and other RF equipment which link equipment, operations, owners, dealers and technicians. These radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national agencies. Any international or national reallocation of frequency bands, including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing, or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands, could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of John Deeres GPS-based products, which could negatively affect John Deeres ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions. For John Deeres agricultural customers, the inability to use high-precision augmented GPS signals or other RF signals could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance, seed, fertilizer, fuel and wage costs. For construction customers, disrupting GPS or RF applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs, as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies. These cost increases could significantly reduce customers profitability and demand for John Deere products.

20  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED OCTOBER31, 2015, 2014 AND 2013 OVERVIEW Organization The company's equipment operations generate revenues and cash primarily from the sale of equipment to John Deere dealers and distributors. The equipment operations manufacture and distribute a full line of agricultural equipment; a variety of commercial and consumer equipment; and a broad range of equipment for construction and forestry. The company's financial services primarily provide credit services, which mainly finance sales and leases of equipment by John Deere dealers and trade receivables purchased from the equipment operations. In addition, financial services offer extended equipment warranties. The information in the following discussion is presented in a format that includes information grouped as consolidated, equipment operations and financial services. The company also views its operations as consisting of two geographic areas, the U.S. and Canada, and outside the U.S. and Canada. The company's operating segments consist of agriculture and turf, construction and forestry, and financial services.
Trends and Economic Conditions The company's agriculture and turf equipment sales decreased 25percent in 2015 and are forecast to decrease by about 8percent for 2016. Industry agricultural machinery sales in the U.S. and Canada for 2016 are forecast to decrease 15 to 20percent, compared to 2015. Industry sales in the European Union (EU) 28nations are forecast to be approximately the same to 5percent lower in 2016, while South American industry sales are projected to decrease about 10 to 15percent from 2015 levels. Asian sales are projected to be about the same or decrease slightly in 2016. Industry sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be approximately the same to 5percent higher. The company's construction and forestry sales decreased 9percent in 2015 and are forecast to decrease about 5percent in 2016. Global forestry industry sales are expected to decline 5 to 10percent from the strong levels in 2015. Net income of the company's financial services operations attributable to Deere& Company in 2016 is expected to be approximately $550million.
Items of concern include the uncertainty of the effectiveness of governmental actions in respect to monetary and fiscal policies, the global economic recovery, the impact of sovereign debt, eurozone issues, capital market disruptions, trade agreements and geopolitical events. Significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and volatility in the price of many commodities could also impact the company's results. Designing and producing products with engines that continue to meet high performance standards and increasingly stringent emissions regulations is one of the company's major priorities.
The company completed a successful year even with further weakness in the global agricultural sector and slowdown in construction equipment markets. The forecast calls for lower results in 2016, but the outlook is considerably better than previous downturns. The company remains in a strong position to carry out its growth plans and attract new customers throughout the world. The company's plans to help meet the world's increasing need for food, shelter and infrastructure continue to move ahead. The company remains confident in the present direction and believes it is on track to deliver value to customers and investors in the years to come.
2015 COMPARED WITH 2014 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Worldwide net income attributable to Deere& Company in 2015 was $1,940million, or $5.77 per share diluted ($5.81 basic), compared with $3,162million, or $8.63 per share diluted ($8.71 basic), in 2014. Net sales and revenues decreased 20percent to $28,863million in 2015, compared with $36,067million in 2014. Net sales of the worldwide equipment operations declined 22percent in 2015 to $25,775million from $32,961million last year. Sales included price realization of 1percent and an unfavorable currency translation effect of 5percent. Equipment net sales in the United States and Canada decreased 18percent for 2015. Outside the U.S. and Canada, net sales decreased 28percent for the year, with an unfavorable currency translation effect of 10percent for 2015.
Worldwide equipment operations had an operating profit of $2,177million in 2015, compared with $4,297million in 2014. The operating profit decline was due primarily to lower shipment volumes, the impact of a less favorable product mix and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange. These factors were partially offset by price realization, lower selling, administrative and general expenses and lower production costs.
Net income of the company's equipment operations was $1,308million for 2015, compared with $2,548million in 2014. In addition to the operating factors mentioned above, a lower effective tax rate benefited the results. The lower rate resulted mainly from a reduction of a valuation allowance recorded during the fourth quarter due to a change in the expected realizable value of a deferred tax asset.
Net income of the financial services operations attributable to Deere& Company in 2015 increased to $633million, compared with $624million in 2014. Results improved due to growth in the average credit portfolio, the previously announced crop insurance sale and higher crop insurance margins experienced prior to divestiture (see Note4), and lower selling, administrative and general expenses. These factors were partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange translation, less favorable financing spreads and higher losses on residual values primarily for construction equipment operating leases. The results in 2014 also benefited from a more favorable effective tax rate. Additional information is presented in the following discussion of the "Worldwide Financial Services Operations." The cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2015 was 78.1percent, compared with 75.2percent last year. The increase was due primarily to the impact of a less favorable product mix and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange, partially offset by price realization and lower production costs.
Finance and interest income increased this year due to a larger average credit portfolio, partially offset by lower average financing rates and the unfavorable effects of currency translation. Other income decreased due primarily to a reduction   21  in crop insurance premiums as a result of the sale of the Crop Insurance operations (see Note4), partially offset by the gain on the sale of the Crop Insurance operations and higher extended warranty revenue. Research and development costs decreased largely due to the effect of currency translation. Selling, administrative and general expenses decreased mainly due to the effect of currency translation, lower incentive compensation and dealer commission expenses, the sale of the Water and Crop Insurance operations, and the deconsolidation of Landscapes (see Note4). Interest expense increased due to higher average interest rates and higher average borrowings, partially offset by the favorable effects of currency translation. Other operating expenses decreased primarily due to a reduction in crop insurance claims, the Water operations' impairment and sale in 2014 (see Note4), the effect of currency translation, partially offset by higher depreciation of equipment on operating leases.
The company has several defined benefit pension plans and defined benefit health care and life insurance plans. The company's postretirement benefit costs for these plans in 2015 were $512million, compared with $432million in 2014. The long-term expected return on plan assets, which is reflected in these costs, was an expected gain of 7.3percent in 2015 and 7.5percent in 2014, or $824million in 2015 and $848million in 2014. The actual return was a gain of $606million in 2015 and $1,213million in 2014. In 2016, the expected return will be approximately 7.3percent. The company's postretirement costs in 2016 are expected to decrease approximately $200million. The company makes any required contributions to the plan assets under applicable regulations and voluntary contributions from time to time based on the company's liquidity and ability to make tax-deductible contributions. Total company contributions to the plans were $131 million in 2015 and $138million in 2014, which include direct benefit payments for unfunded plans. These contributions also included voluntary contributions to plan assets of $3million in 2015 and $5million in 2014. Total company contributions in 2016 are expected to be approximately $98million, which are primarily direct benefit payments for unfunded plans. The company has no significant required contributions to pension plan assets in 2016 under applicable funding regulations. See the discussion in "Critical Accounting Policies" for more information about postretirement benefit obligations.
BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS The following discussion relates to operating results by reportable segment and geographic area. Operating profit is income before certain external interest expense, certain foreign exchange gains or losses, income taxes and corporate expenses. However, operating profit of the financial services segment includes the effect of interest expense and foreign currency exchange gains or losses.
Worldwide Agriculture and Turf Operations The agriculture and turf segment had an operating profit of $1,649million for the year, compared with $3,649million in 2014. Net sales decreased 25percent in 2015 due largely to lower shipment volumes and the unfavorable effects of currency translation. These factors were partially offset by price realization. Lower operating profit was driven primarily by the impact of lower shipment volumes, a less favorable product mix and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange, partially offset by price realization, lower selling, administrative and general expenses, and lower production costs.
Worldwide Construction and Forestry Operations The construction and forestry segment had an operating profit of $528million in 2015, compared with $648million in 2014. Net sales decreased 9percent for the year mainly as a result of lower shipment volumes and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by price realization. Operating profit declined mainly due to lower shipment volumes, the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange and higher production costs, partially offset by price realization and lower selling, administrative and general expenses.
Worldwide Financial Services Operations The operating profit of the financial services segment was $963million in 2015, compared with $921million in 2014. The results improved due to growth in the average credit portfolio, the previously announced Crop Insurance operations sale (see Note4) and higher crop insurance margins experienced prior to the divestiture, and lower selling, administrative and general expenses. These factors were partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange translation, less favorable financing spreads and higher losses on residual values primarily for construction equipment operating leases. Total revenues of the financial services operations, including intercompany revenues, were approximately the same in 2015, compared with 2014. The average balance of receivables and leases financed was 1percent higher in 2015, compared with 2014. Interest expense increased 6percent in 2015 as a result of higher average borrowings and higher average interest rates. The financial services operations' ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 3.29 to 1 in 2015, compared with 3.37 to 1 in 2014.
Equipment Operations in U.S. and Canada The equipment operations in the U.S. and Canada had an operating profit of $1,643million in 2015, compared with $3,311million in 2014. The decline was due primarily to lower shipment volumes and the impact of a less favorable product mix. The decline was partially offset by price realization. Net sales decreased 18percent due primarily to lower shipment volumes and the unfavorable effects of currency translation, partially offset by price realization. The physical volume of sales decreased 18percent, compared with 2014.
Equipment Operations outside U.S. and Canada The equipment operations outside the U.S. and Canada had an operating profit of $534million in 2015, compared with $986million in 2014. The decrease was due primarily to lower shipment volumes, the impact of a less favorable product mix and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange. These factors were partially offset by price realization. Net sales were 28percent lower primarily reflecting decreased shipment volumes and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation, partially offset by price realization. The physical volume of sales decreased 19percent, compared with 2014.
MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK Company equipment sales are projected to decrease 7percent for fiscal year 2016 and decrease about 11percent for the first quarter, compared with the same periods in 2015. For fiscal year 2016, net income attributable to Deere& Company is anticipated to be about $1.4billion.
22  Agriculture and Turf.
The company's worldwide sales of agriculture and turf equipment are forecast to decrease by about 8percent for fiscal year 2016, including a negative currency translation effect of about 2percent. Industry sales for agricultural equipment in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be down 15 to 20percent for 2016. The decline, which reflects the impact of low commodity prices and stagnant farm incomes, is expected to be most pronounced in the sale of higher horsepower models. Full year 2016 industry sales in the EU28 are forecast to be about the same to 5percent lower, with the decline attributable to low commodity prices and farm incomes, including further pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to decrease 10 to 15percent mainly as a result of economic concerns in Brazil and uncertainty about government sponsored financing. Asian sales are projected to be about the same to down slightly, due in part to weakness in China. Industry sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be about the same to 5percent higher for 2016, benefiting from general economic growth.
Construction and Forestry.
The company's worldwide sales of construction and forestry equipment are forecast to decrease about 5percent for 2016, including a negative currency translation effect of about 1percent. The forecast decline in sales reflects the impact of weak conditions in the North American energy sector, especially in Canada, as well as lower sales outside the U.S. and Canada. In forestry, global sales are expected to decrease 5 to 10percent from 2015's strong levels, primarily as a result of lower sales in the U.S. and Canada.
Financial Services.
Fiscal year 2016 net income attributable to Deere& Company for the financial services operations is expected to be approximately $550million. The outlook reflects less favorable financing spreads and an increased provision for credit losses. Additionally, 2015 results benefited from a gain on the sale of the Crop Insurance operations.
SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Statements under "Overview," "Market Conditions and Outlook," and other forward-looking statements herein that relate to future events, expectations, trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change, and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all of the company's businesses.
The company's agricultural equipment business is subject to a number of uncertainties including the many interrelated factors that affect farmers' confidence. These factors include demand for agricultural products, world grain stocks, weather conditions (including its effects on timely planting and harvesting), soil conditions (including low subsoil moisture), harvest yields, prices for commodities and livestock, crop and livestock production expenses, availability of transport for crops, the growth and sustainability of non-food uses for some crops (including ethanol and biodiesel production), real estate values, available acreage for farming, the land ownership policies of various governments, changes in government farm programs and policies (including those in Argentina, Brazil, China, the European Union, India, Russia and the U.S.), international reaction to such programs, changes in and effects of crop insurance programs, global trade agreements, animal diseases and their effects on poultry, beef and pork consumption and prices, crop pests and diseases, and the level of farm product exports (including concerns about genetically modified organisms).
Factors affecting the outlook for the company's turf and utility equipment include consumer confidence, weather conditions, customer profitability, consumer borrowing patterns, consumer purchasing preferences, housing starts, infrastructure investment, spending by municipalities and golf courses, and consumable input costs.
Consumer spending patterns, real estate and housing prices, the number of housing starts and interest rates are especially important to sales of the company's construction and forestry equipment. The levels of public and non-residential construction also impact the results of the company's construction and forestry segment. Prices for pulp, paper, lumber and structural panels are important to sales of forestry equipment.
All of the company's businesses and its reported results are affected by general economic conditions in the global markets and industries in which the company operates, especially material changes in economic activity in these markets and industries; customer confidence in general economic conditions; foreign currency exchange rates and their volatility, especially fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar; interest rates; and inflation and deflation rates. Government spending and taxing could adversely affect the economy, employment, consumer and corporate spending, and company results.
Customer and company operations and results could be affected by changes in weather patterns (including the effects of drought and drier than normal conditions in certain markets); the political and social stability of the global markets in which the company operates; the effects of, or response to, terrorism and security threats; wars and other conflicts and the threat thereof and the response thereto; natural disasters; and the spread of major epidemics.
Significant changes in market liquidity conditions and any failure to comply with financial covenants in credit agreements could impact access to funding and funding costs, which could reduce the company's earnings and cash flows. Financial market conditions could also negatively impact customer access to capital for purchases of the company's products and customer confidence and purchase decisions, borrowing and repayment practices, and the number and size of customer loan delinquencies and defaults. A debt crisis, in Europe or elsewhere, could negatively impact currencies, global financial markets, social and political stability, funding sources and costs, asset and obligation values, customers, suppliers, demand for equipment, and company operations and results. The company's investment management activities could be impaired by changes in the equity, bond and other financial markets, which would negatively affect earnings.
Additional factors that could materially affect the company's operations, access to capital, expenses and results include changes in and the impact of governmental trade, banking, monetary and fiscal policies, including financial regulatory reform and its effects on the consumer finance   23  industry, derivatives, funding costs and other areas, and governmental programs, policies, tariffs and sanctions in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of certain industries or sectors (including protectionist, economic, punitive and expropriation policies and trade and licensing restrictions that could disrupt international commerce); actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and other central banks; actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other financial regulators; actions by environmental, health and safety regulatory agencies, including those related to engine emissions, carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, noise and the effects of climate change; changes in labor regulations; changes to accounting standards; changes in tax rates, estimates, and regulations and company actions related thereto; compliance with U.S. and foreign laws when expanding to new markets and otherwise; and actions by other regulatory bodies including changes in laws and regulations affecting the sectors in which the company operates. Trade, financial and other sanctions imposed by the U.S., the European Union, Russia and other countries could negatively impact company assets, operations, sales, forecasts and results. Customer and company operations and results also could be affected by changes to GPS radio frequency bands or their permitted uses.
Other factors that could materially affect results include production, design and technological innovations and difficulties, including capacity and supply constraints and prices; the availability and prices of strategically sourced materials, components and whole goods; delays or disruptions in the company's supply chain or the loss of liquidity by suppliers; disruptions of infrastructures that support communications, operations or distribution; the failure of suppliers to comply with laws, regulations and company policy pertaining to employment, human rights, health, safety, the environment and other ethical business practices; events that damage the company's reputation or brand; significant investigations, claims, lawsuits or other legal proceedings; start-up of new plants and new products; the success of new product initiatives and customer acceptance of new products; changes in customer product preferences and sales mix whether as a result of changes in equipment design to meet government regulations or for other reasons; gaps or limitations in rural broadband coverage, capacity and speed needed to support technology solutions; oil and energy prices, supplies and volatility; the availability and cost of freight; actions of competitors in the various industries in which the company competes, particularly price discounting; dealer practices especially as to levels of new and used field inventories; labor relations and contracts; acquisitions and divestitures of businesses; the integration of new businesses; the implementation of organizational changes; difficulties related to the conversion and implementation of enterprise resource planning systems that disrupt business, negatively impact supply or distribution relationships or create higher than expected costs; security breaches and other disruptions to the company's information technology infrastructure; and changes in company declared dividends and common stock issuances and repurchases.
Company results are also affected by changes in the level and funding of employee retirement benefits, changes in market values of investment assets, the level of interest and discount rates, and compensation, retirement and mortality rates which impact retirement benefit costs, and significant changes in health care costs including those which may result from governmental action.
The liquidity and ongoing profitability of John Deere Capital Corporation and other credit subsidiaries depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements, to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities, and to fund purchases of the company's products. If general economic conditions deteriorate or capital markets become volatile, funding could be unavailable or insufficient. Additionally, customer confidence levels may result in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact write-offs and provisions for credit losses.
The company's outlook is based upon assumptions relating to the factors described above, which are sometimes based upon estimates and data prepared by government agencies. Such estimates and data are often revised. The company, except as required by law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise its outlook, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. Further information concerning the company and its businesses, including factors that potentially could materially affect the company's financial results, is included in the company's other filings with the SEC.
2014 COMPARED WITH 2013 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Worldwide net income attributable to Deere& Company in 2014 was $3,162million, or $8.63 per share diluted ($8.71 basic), compared with $3,537million, or $9.09 per share diluted ($9.18 basic), in 2013. Net sales and revenues decreased 5percent to $36,067million in 2014, compared with $37,795million in 2013. Net sales of the equipment operations decreased 6percent in 2014 to $32,961million from $34,998million in 2013. The sales decrease was largely due to lower shipment volumes and an unfavorable foreign currency translation effect of 1percent, partially offset by price realization of 2percent. Net sales in the U.S. and Canada decreased 8percent in 2014. Net sales outside the U.S. and Canada decreased 3percent in 2014, which included an unfavorable effect of 1percent for foreign currency translation.
Worldwide equipment operations had an operating profit of $4,297million in 2014, compared with $5,058million in 2013. The operating profit decline was due primarily to the impact of lower shipment and production volumes, a less favorable product mix, the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange and higher production costs primarily related to the impact of engine emission programs. The decline was partially offset by price realization. Results in 2014 were also affected by impairment charges for the company's John Deere Landscapes and John Deere Water operations (see Notes4 and5).
The equipment operations' net income was $2,548million in 2014, compared with $2,974million in 2013. The same operating factors mentioned above affected these results.
Net income of the financial services operations attributable to Deere& Company in 2014 increased to $624million,   24  compared with $565million in 2013. The improvement was due primarily to growth in the credit portfolio, a more favorable effective tax rate, partially offset by lower crop insurance margins, higher selling, administrative and general expenses and a higher provision for credit losses. Additional information is presented in the following discussion of the "Worldwide Financial Services Operations." The cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2014 was 75.2percent, compared with 73.3percent in 2013. The increase was due primarily to a less favorable product mix, the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange and higher production costs largely related to engine emission requirements, partially offset by price realization.
Finance and interest income increased in 2014 due to a larger average credit portfolio, partially offset by lower average financing rates. Other income increased due primarily to higher insurance premiums and service revenue. Research and development costs decreased primarily due to the completion of certain product developments in 2014 compared to 2013. Selling, administrative and general expenses decreased due primarily to the deconsolidation of Landscapes and the sale of the Water operations (see Note4). Interest expense decreased due to lower average borrowing rates, partially offset by higher average borrowings. Other operating expenses increased due primarily to higher depreciation of equipment on operating leases, higher insurance claims and the write-down to realizable value and sale of the Water operations, partially offset by impairment charges in 2013 for the Landscapes operations (see Notes4 and 5).
The company has several defined benefit pension plans and defined benefit health care and life insurance plans. The company's postretirement benefit costs for these plans in 2014 were $432million, compared with $575million in 2013. The long-term expected return on plan assets, which is reflected in these costs, was an expected gain of 7.5percent in 2014 and 7.8percent in 2013, or $848million in 2014 and $862million in 2013. The actual return was a gain of $1,213million in 2014 and $1,470million in 2013. Total company contributions to the plans were $138million in 2014 and $338million in 2013, which include direct benefit payments for unfunded plans. These contributions also included voluntary contributions to plan assets of $5million in 2014 and $227million in 2013.
BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS Worldwide Agriculture and Turf Operations The agriculture and turf segment had an operating profit of $3,649million in 2014, compared with $4,680million in 2013. Net sales decreased 9percent in 2014 due largely to lower shipment volumes, the previously announced sales of the company's Landscapes and Water operations and the unfavorable effects of currency translation. Partially offsetting these factors was price realization. The decrease in operating profit was driven mainly by lower shipment and production volumes, a less favorable product mix, the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange and higher production costs primarily related to engine emission programs. The decline was partially offset by price realization. As previously noted, results in 2013 were affected by impairment charges for the Landscapes and Water operations (see Notes4 and 5).
Worldwide Construction and Forestry Operations The construction and forestry segment had an operating profit of $648million in 2014, compared with $378million in 2013. Net sales increased 12percent in 2014 mainly as a result of higher shipment volumes and price realization, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Operating profit benefited in 2014 from higher shipment volumes, lower selling, administrative and general expenses and price realization, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange.
Worldwide Financial Services Operations The operating profit of the financial services segment was $921million in 2014, compared with $870million in 2013. The results were higher due primarily to growth in the credit portfolio, partially offset by lower crop insurance margins, higher selling, administrative and general expenses and a higher provision for credit losses. Total revenues of the financial services operations, including intercompany revenues, increased 9percent in 2014, primarily reflecting the larger portfolio. The average balance of receivables and leases financed was 13percent higher in 2014, compared with 2013. Interest expense decreased 12percent in 2014 as a result of lower average borrowing rates, partially offset by higher average borrowings. The financial services operations' ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 3.37 to 1 in 2014, compared with 2.90 to 1 in 2013.
Equipment Operations in U.S. and Canada The equipment operations in the U.S. and Canada had an operating profit of $3,311million in 2014, compared with $4,062million in 2013. The decline was due primarily to the impact of lower shipment and production volumes, a less favorable product mix and higher production costs primarily related to engine emission programs. The decline was partially offset by price realization. Results in 2013 were also affected by impairment charges for the Landscapes and Water operations. Net sales decreased 8percent due primarily to lower shipment volumes, partially offset by price realization. The physical volume of sales decreased 9percent, compared with 2013.
Equipment Operations outside U.S. and Canada The equipment operations outside the U.S. and Canada had an operating profit of $986million in 2014, compared with $996million in 2013. The decrease was due primarily to the impact of lower shipment and production volumes, a less favorable product mix, the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange, higher production costs and an impairment charge for the China operations (see Note5), partially offset by price realization. Results in 2013 were also affected by impairment charges for the Water operations. Net sales were 3percent lower primarily reflecting decreased shipment volumes and the effect of foreign currency translation, partially offset by price realization. The physical volume of sales decreased 5percent, compared with 2013.
25  CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY The discussion of capital resources and liquidity has been organized to review separately, where appropriate, the company's consolidated totals, equipment operations and financial services operations.
CONSOLIDATED Positive cash flows from consolidated operating activities in 2015 were $3,740million. This resulted primarily from net income adjusted for non-cash provisions, a decrease in receivables related to sales, a change in the retirement benefits adjustment and a decrease in insurance receivables prior to the Crop Insurance operations sale, which were partially offset by an increase in inventories, primarily related to equipment transferred to operating leases (see Note6), a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and a change in accrued income taxes payable/receivable. Cash outflows from investing activities were $1,059million in 2015, due primarily to the cost of receivables (excluding receivables related to sales) and cost of equipment on operating leases exceeding the collections of receivables and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by $1,160million, purchases of property and equipment of $694million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales exceeding purchases of marketable securities by $706million and proceeds from sales of businesses, net of cash sold, of $149million. Cash outflows from financing activities were $2,119million in 2015 due primarily to repurchases of common stock of $2,771million and dividends paid of $816million, partially offset by an increase in borrowings of $1,349million. Cash and cash equivalents increased $375million during 2015.
Over the last three years, operating activities have provided an aggregate of $10,521million in cash. In addition, increases in borrowings were $6,986million, proceeds from maturities and sales exceeded purchases of marketable securities by $931million, proceeds from sales of businesses were $517million and proceeds from issuance of common stock (resulting from the exercise of stock options) were $496million. The aggregate amount of these cash flows was used mainly to repurchase common stock of $7,033million, acquire receivables (excluding receivables related to sales) and equipment on operating leases that exceeded collections of receivables and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by $6,804million, purchase property and equipment of $2,901million and pay dividends of $2,355million. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $490million over the three-year period.
The company has access to most global markets at reasonable costs and expects to have sufficient sources of global funding and liquidity to meet its funding needs. The company's exposures to receivables from customers in European countries experiencing economic strains are not significant. Sources of liquidity for the company include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, funds from operations, the issuance of commercial paper and term debt, the securitization of retail notes (both public and private markets) and committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit. The company's commercial paper outstanding at October31, 2015 and 2014 was $2,968million and $2,633million, respectively, while the total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities position was $4,600million and $5,002million, respectively. The amount of the total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries, in which earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested, was $1,588million and $1,025million at October31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Lines of Credit.
The company also has access to bank lines of credit with various banks throughout the world. Worldwide lines of credit totaled $7,205million at October31, 2015, $4,031million of which were unused. For the purpose of computing unused credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings, excluding secured borrowings and the current portion of long-term borrowings, were primarily considered to constitute utilization. Included in the total credit lines at October31, 2015 were long-term credit facility agreements of $2,900million, expiring in April 2019, and $2,900million, expiring in April 2020. These credit agreements require John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation) to maintain its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter and the ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to capital base (total subordinated debt and stockholder's equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than 11 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. The credit agreements also require the equipment operations to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capital (total debt and stockholders' equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) of 65percent or less at the end of each fiscal quarter. Under this provision, the company's excess equity capacity and retained earnings balance free of restriction at October31, 2015 was $8,835million. Alternatively under this provision, the equipment operations had the capacity to incur additional debt of $16,408million at October31, 2015. All of these requirements of the credit agreements have been met during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.
Debt Ratings.
To access public debt capital markets, the company relies on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to the company's securities as an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors. A security rating is not a recommendation by the rating agency to buy, sell or hold company securities. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw company ratings based on its assessment of the company's current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Each agency's rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs, including costs of derivative transactions, and reduced access to debt capital markets. The senior long-term and short-term debt ratings and outlook currently assigned to unsecured company securities by the rating agencies engaged by the company are as follows:        Senior Long-Term Short-Term Outlook        Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
A2 Prime-1 Stable Standard& Poor's A A-1 Stable        Trade accounts and notes receivable primarily arise from sales of goods to independent dealers. Trade receivables decreased by $227million in 2015 due primarily to foreign currency translation and lower agriculture and turf shipment volumes. The ratio of trade accounts and notes receivable at   26  October31 to fiscal year net sales was 12percent in 2015 and 10percent in 2014. Total worldwide agriculture and turf receivables decreased $355million and construction and forestry receivables increased $128million. The collection period for trade receivables averages less than 12months. The percentage of trade receivables outstanding for a period exceeding 12months was 1percent at both October31, 2015 and 2014.
Deere& Company's stockholders' equity was $6,743million at October31, 2015, compared with $9,063million at October31, 2014. The decrease of $2,320million resulted from an increase in treasury stock of $2,663million, dividends declared of $800million and a change in the cumulative translation adjustment of $935million, which were partially offset by net income attributable to Deere& Company of $1,940million and an increase in common stock of $150million.
EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS The company's equipment businesses are capital intensive and are subject to seasonal variations in financing requirements for inventories and certain receivables from dealers. The equipment operations sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to financial services. To the extent necessary, funds provided from operations are supplemented by external financing sources.
Cash provided by operating activities of the equipment operations during 2015, including intercompany cash flows, was $3,055million due primarily to net income adjusted for non-cash provisions, a change in the retirement benefits and a decrease in trade receivables, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and a change in accrued income taxes payable/receivable.
Over the last three years, these operating activities, including intercompany cash flows, have provided an aggregate of $12,256million in cash.
Trade receivables held by the equipment operations decreased by $221million during 2015. The equipment operations sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to financial services (see previous consolidated discussion).
Inventories decreased by $393million in 2015 due primarily to lower agriculture and turf production volumes, lower sales and currency translation. Most of these inventories are valued on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The ratios of inventories on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis (see Note15), which approximates current cost, to fiscal year cost of sales were 26percent and 23percent at October31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Total interest-bearing debt of the equipment operations was $4,925million at the end of 2015, compared with $5,077million at the end of 2014 and $5,951million at the end of 2013. The ratio of total debt to total capital (total interest-bearing debt and stockholders' equity) at the end of 2015, 2014 and 2013 was 42percent, 36percent and 37percent, respectively.
Property and equipment cash expenditures for the equipment operations in 2015 were $688million, compared with $1,045million in 2014. Capital expenditures in 2016 are estimated to be $800million.
In November 2015, the company announced the signing of definitive purchase agreements to acquire Monosem, a European market leader for precision planters, and Precision Planting LLC., a developer and distributor of retrofit components for precision agriculture applications. The total estimated purchase price, net of cash acquired, is $325million. The acquisitions are subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and are expected to close in the first half of 2016.
FINANCIAL SERVICES The financial services operations rely on their ability to raise substantial amounts of funds to finance their receivable and lease portfolios. Their primary sources of funds for this purpose are a combination of commercial paper, term debt, securitization of retail notes, equity capital and borrowings from Deere& Company.
The cash provided by operating activities and financing activities was used primarily for investing activities. Cash flows from the financial services' operating activities, including intercompany cash flows, were $1,582million in 2015. Cash used by investing activities totaled $1,235million in 2015, due primarily to the cost of receivables (excluding trade and wholesale) and cost of equipment on operating leases exceeding collections of these receivables and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by $2,056million, partially offset by a decrease in trade receivables and wholesale notes of $657million and proceeds from sales of businesses, net of cash sold, of $149million. Cash used for financing activities totaled $262million in 2015, representing primarily a decrease in borrowings from Deere& Company of $929million and dividends paid of $680million to Deere& Company, partially offset by an increase in external borrowings of $1,346million. Cash and cash equivalents increased $44million.
Over the last three years, the operating activities, including intercompany cash flows, have provided $4,147million in cash. In addition, an increase in total borrowings of $9,125million, capital investment from Deere& Company of $216million and proceeds from sales of businesses, net of cash sold, of $149million provided cash inflows. These amounts have been used mainly to fund receivables (excluding trade and wholesale) and equipment on operating lease acquisitions, which exceeded collections and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by $10,415million, fund an increase in trade receivables and wholesale notes of $1,278million, pay dividends to Deere& Company of $1,016million and purchase marketable securities that exceeded proceeds from maturities and sales by $94million. Cash and cash equivalents increased $518million over the three-year period.
Receivables and equipment on operating leases decreased by $1,410million in 2015, compared with 2014. Total acquisition volumes of receivables (excluding trade and wholesale notes) and cost of equipment on operating leases decreased 11percent in 2015, compared with 2014. The volumes of financing leases, retail notes and revolving charge accounts decreased approximately 26percent, 19percent and 1percent, respectively, while operating lease volumes increased 14percent. During 2015, the amount of wholesale notes and trade receivables decreased 32percent and 18percent, respectively. At October31, 2015 and 2014, net receivables and leases administered, which include receivables administered but not owned, were $38,188million and $39,629million, respectively.
Total external interest-bearing debt of the financial services operations was $31,925million at the end of 2015, compared with $31,882million at the end of 2014 and $28,524million at the end of 2013. Total external borrowings have changed   27  generally corresponding with the level of the receivable and lease portfolio, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in payables owed to Deere& Company and the change in investment from Deere& Company. The financial services operations' ratio of total interest-bearing debt to total stockholder's equity was to 7.6 to 1 at the end of 2015, 7.4 to 1 at the end of 2014 and 7.3 to 1 at the end of 2013.
The Capital Corporation has a revolving credit agreement to utilize bank conduit facilities to securitize retail notes (see Note13). At October31, 2015, the facility had a total capacity, or "financing limit," of up to $3,500million of secured financings at any time. The facility was renewed in November 2015 with a capacity of $3,880million. After a three-year revolving period, unless the banks and Capital Corporation agree to renew, Capital Corporation would liquidate the secured borrowings over time as payments on the retail notes are collected. At October31, 2015, $1,848million of short-term securitization borrowings was outstanding under the agreement.
During 2015, the financial services operations issued $2,716million and retired $2,685million of retail note securitization borrowings. During 2015, the financial services operations also issued $5,705million and retired $4,649million of long-term borrowings, which were primarily medium-term notes.
OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS At October31, 2015, the company had approximately $162million of guarantees issued primarily to banks outside the U.S. related to third-party receivables for the retail financing of John Deere equipment. The company may recover a portion of any required payments incurred under these agreements from repossession of the equipment collateralizing the receivables. The maximum remaining term of the receivables guaranteed at October31, 2015 was approximately four years.
AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The payment schedule for the company's contractual obligations at October31, 2015 in millions of dollars is as follows:              Total  Less than 1year  2&3 years  4&5 years  More than 5years              On-balance-sheet           Debt*           Equipment operations  $ 4,939  $ 465  $ 110   $ 753    $ 3,611   Financial services**  31,672  10,291  12,322   5,447    3,612                     Total  36,611  10,756  12,432   6,200    7,223   Interest relating to debt***  4,471  618  988   712    2,153   Accounts payable  2,251  2,137  82   30    2   Capital leases  60  37  17   5    1   Off-balance-sheet           Purchase obligations  2,361  2,300  21   15    25   Operating leases  354  98  125   71    60                     Total  $ 46,108  $ 15,946  $ 13,665   $ 7,033    $ 9,464                                                         * Principal payments.
** Securitization borrowings of $4,590million classified as short-term on the balance sheet related to the securitization of retail notes are included in this table based on the expected payment schedule (see Note18).
*** Includes projected payments related to interest rate swaps.
The previous table does not include unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of approximately $229million at October31, 2015, since the timing of future payments is not reasonably estimable at this time (see Note8). For additional information regarding pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations, short-term borrowings, long-term borrowings and lease obligations, see Notes7, 18, 20 and 21, respectively.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on the financial statements. The accounting policies below are those management believes are the most critical to the preparation of the company's financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The company's other accounting policies are described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Sales Incentives At the time a sale to a dealer is recognized, the company records an estimate of the future sales incentive costs for allowances and financing programs that will be due when the dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. The estimate is based on historical data, announced incentive programs, field inventory levels and retail sales volumes. The final cost of these programs and the amount of accrual required for a specific sale are fully determined when the dealer sells the equipment to the retail customer. This is due to numerous programs available at any particular time and new programs that may be announced after the company records the sale. Changes in the mix and types of programs affect these estimates, which are reviewed quarterly.
The sales incentive accruals at October31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $1,463million, $1,573million and $1,531million, respectively. The decrease in 2015 was due primarily to lower sales volumes. The increase in 2014 was due primarily to higher sales incentive accruals related to the U.S. and Canada operations.
The estimation of the sales incentive accrual is impacted by many assumptions. One of the key assumptions is the historical percent of sales incentive costs to retail sales from dealers. Over the last five fiscal years, this percent has varied by an average of approximately plus or minus 1.0percent, compared to the average sales incentive costs to retail sales percent during that period. Holding other assumptions constant, if this estimated cost experience percent were to increase or decrease 1.0percent, the sales incentive accrual at October31, 2015 would increase or decrease by approximately $70million.
Product Warranties At the time a sale to a dealer is recognized, the company records the estimated future warranty costs. The company generally determines its total warranty liability by applying historical claims rate experience to the estimated amount of equipment that has been sold and is still under warranty based on dealer inventories and retail sales. The historical claims rate is primarily determined by a review of five-year claims costs and consideration of current   28  quality developments. Variances in claims experience and the type of warranty programs affect these estimates, which are reviewed quarterly.
The product warranty accruals, excluding extended warranty unamortized premiums, at October31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $807million, $809million and $822million, respectively. The changes were due primarily to lower sales volumes in 2015 and 2014.
Estimates used to determine the product warranty accruals are significantly affected by the historical percent of warranty claims costs to sales. Over the last five fiscal years, this percent has varied by an average of approximately plus or minus .09percent, compared to the average warranty costs to sales percent during that period. Holding other assumptions constant, if this estimated cost experience percent were to increase or decrease .09percent, the warranty accrual at October31, 2015 would increase or decrease by approximately $25million.
Postretirement Benefit Obligations Pension obligations and other postretirement employee benefit (OPEB) obligations are based on various assumptions used by the company's actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in assumptions affect future expenses and obligations.
The pension liabilities, net of pension assets, recognized on the balance sheet at October31, 2015 and 2014 were $1,022million and $743million, respectively. The pension assets, net of pension liabilities, at October31, 2013 were $40million. The increase in pension net liabilities in 2015 was due primarily to interest on the liabilities and updated mortality assumptions based on the Society of Actuaries' (SOA) RP-2015 base table and MP 2015 projection scale, partially offset by return on plan assets. The increase in pension net liabilities in 2014 was due primarily to decreases in discount rates and updated mortality assumptions based on the SOA RP-2000 base table and mortality projection scale BB. The OPEB liabilities, net of OPEB assets, at October31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $5,395million, $5,347million and $4,769million, respectively. The increase in OPEB net liabilities in 2015 was due primarily to interest on the liabilities and a change in the health care cost trend, primarily related to higher prescription drug costs, partially offset by the transition to a Medicare Advantage plan for certain retirees (see Note7). The increase in 2014 was due primarily to the change in the mortality assumptions mentioned above and decreases in discount rates, partially offset by a change in the retiree medical credit plan (see Note7).
Beginning in 2016, the company will change the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The new method uses the spot yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligations to relevant projected cash outflows. Prior to 2016, the service and interest costs were determined using a single weighted-average discount rate based on hypothetical AA yield curves used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. The change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offsets in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.
The company changed to the new method to provide a more precise measure of interest and service costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates. The company will account for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016. The discount rates used to measure the 2016 service costs are 4.3percent and 5.0percent for pension and OPEB, respectively. The discount rates used to measure the 2016 interest costs are 3.4percent and 3.5percent for pension and OPEB, respectively. The previous method would have used a discount rate for both service and interest costs of 4.1percent for pension and 4.3percent for OPEB. The decrease in the 2016 service and interest costs is approximately $175million compared to the previous method.
The effect of hypothetical changes to selected assumptions on the company's major U.S. retirement benefit plans would be as follows in millions of dollars:           October31,2015  2016  Assumptions  Percentage Change  Increase (Decrease) PBO/APBO*  Increase (Decrease) Expense          Pension         Discount rate**  +/-.5   $ (654)/733    $ (32)/36   Expected return onassets  +/-.5      (48)/48   OPEB         Discount rate**  +/-.5   (356)/395    (15)/16   Expected return onassets  +/-.5      (3)/3   Health care cost trendrate**  +/-1.0   791/(606)    96/(74)   * Projected benefit obligation (PBO) for pension plans and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) for OPEB plans.
** Pretax impact on service cost, interest cost and amortization of gains or losses.
Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment annually and when events or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is reduced below its carrying amount. The end of the fiscal third quarter is the annual measurement date. To test for goodwill impairment, the carrying value of each reporting unit is compared with its fair value. If the carrying value of the goodwill is considered impaired, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill.
An estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit is determined through a combination of comparable market values for similar businesses and discounted cash flows. These estimates can change significantly based on such factors as the reporting unit's financial performance, economic conditions, interest rates, growth rates, pricing, changes in business strategies and competition.
29  Based on this testing, the company has not identified a reporting unit for which the goodwill was impaired in 2015, 2014 and 2013. A 10percent decrease in the estimated fair value of the company's reporting units would have had no impact on the carrying value of goodwill at the annual measurement date in 2015.
Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses represents an estimate of the losses inherent in the company's receivable portfolio. The level of the allowance is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including historical loss experience by product category, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic conditions and credit risk quality. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly. Different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses.
The total allowance for credit losses at October31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $198million, $230million and $240million, respectively. The allowance decreased in 2015 compared to 2014, and decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, due primarily to foreign currency translation in both periods.
The assumptions used in evaluating the company's exposure to credit losses involve estimates and significant judgment. The historical loss experience on the receivable portfolio represents one of the key assumptions involved in determining the allowance for credit losses. Over the last five fiscal years, this percent has varied by an average of approximately plus or minus .04percent, compared to the average loss experience percent during that period. Holding other assumptions constant, if this estimated loss experience on the receivable portfolio were to increase or decrease .04percent, the allowance for credit losses at October31, 2015 would increase or decrease by approximately $14million.
Operating Lease Residual Values The carrying value of equipment on operating leases is affected by the estimated fair values of the equipment at the end of the lease (residual values). Upon termination of the lease, the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third party, in which case the company may record a gain or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sales price. The residual values are dependent on current economic conditions and are reviewed when events or circumstances necessitate an evaluation. Changes in residual value assumptions would affect the amount of depreciation expense and the amount of investment in equipment on operating leases.
The total operating lease residual values at October31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $3,603million, $2,786million and $2,115million, respectively. The changes in 2015 and 2014 were due primarily to the increasing levels of operating leases.
Estimates used in determining end of lease market values for equipment on operating leases significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense. Hypothetically, if future market values for this equipment were to decrease 10percent from the company's present estimates, the total impact would be to increase the company's annual depreciation for equipment on operating leases by approximately $175million.
30  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MARKET RISK INFORMATION The company is naturally exposed to various interest rate and foreign currency risks. As a result, the company enters into derivative transactions to manage certain of these exposures that arise in the normal course of business and not for the purpose of creating speculative positions or trading. The company's financial services operations manage the relationship of the types and amounts of their funding sources to their receivable and lease portfolio in an effort to diminish risk due to interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, while responding to favorable financing opportunities. Accordingly, from time to time, these operations enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage their interest rate exposure. The company also has foreign currency exposures at some of its foreign and domestic operations related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies. The company has entered into agreements related to the management of these foreign currency transaction risks.
Interest Rate Risk Quarterly, the company uses a combination of cash flow models to assess the sensitivity of its financial instruments with interest rate exposure to changes in market interest rates. The models calculate the effect of adjusting interest rates as follows. Cash flows for financing receivables are discounted at the current prevailing rate for each receivable portfolio. Cash flows for marketable securities are primarily discounted at the applicable benchmark yield curve plus market credit spreads. Cash flows for unsecured borrowings are discounted at the applicable benchmark yield curve plus market credit spreads for similarly rated borrowers. Cash flows for securitized borrowings are discounted at the swap yield curve plus a market credit spread for similarly rated borrowers. Cash flows for interest rate swaps are projected and discounted using forward rates from the swap yield curve at the repricing dates. The net loss in these financial instruments' fair values which would be caused by increasing the interest rates by 10percent from the market rates at October31, 2015 would have been approximately $14million. The net loss from decreasing the interest rates by 10percent at October31, 2014 would have been approximately $18million.
Foreign Currency Risk In the equipment operations, the company's practice is to hedge significant currency exposures. Worldwide foreign currency exposures are reviewed quarterly. Based on the equipment operations' anticipated and committed foreign currency cash inflows, outflows and hedging policy for the next twelve months, the company estimates that a hypothetical 10percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies through 2016 would decrease the 2016 expected net cash inflows by approximately $32million. At October31, 2014, a hypothetical 10percent weakening of the U.S. dollar under similar assumptions and calculations indicated a potential approximate $16million adverse effect on the 2015 net cash inflows.
In the financial services operations, the company's policy is to hedge the foreign currency risk if the currency of the borrowings does not match the currency of the receivable portfolio. As a result, a hypothetical 10percent adverse change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the financial services cash flows.

36  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION AND CONSOLIDATION Structure of Operations The information in the notes and related commentary are presented in a format which includes data grouped as follows: Equipment Operations Includes the company's agriculture and turf operations and construction and forestry operations with financial services reflected on the equity basis.
Financial Services Includes primarily the company's financing operations.
Consolidated Represents the consolidation of the equipment operations and financial services. References to "Deere& Company" or "the company" refer to the entire enterprise.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements represent primarily the consolidation of all companies in which Deere& Company has a controlling interest. Certain variable interest entities (VIEs) are consolidated since the company has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. Deere& Company records its investment in each unconsolidated affiliated company (generally 20 to 50percent ownership) at its related equity in the net assets of such affiliate (see Note10). Other investments (less than 20percent ownership) are recorded at cost.
Fiscal Year The company has historically and continues to use a 52/53week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in the reporting period. The fiscal year ends for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were November1, 2015, November2, 2014 and October27, 2013, respectively. Fiscal year 2014 contained 53weeks. For ease of presentation, the consolidated financial statements and notes continue to be dated October31.
Variable Interest Entities See Note13 for VIEs related to securitization of financing receivables.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following are significant accounting policies in addition to those included in other notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Use of Estimates in Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition Sales of equipment and service parts are recorded when the sales price is determinable and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to independent parties based on the sales agreements in effect. In the U.S. and most international locations, this transfer occurs primarily when goods are shipped. In Canada and some other international locations, certain goods are shipped to dealers on a consignment basis under which the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the dealer.
Accordingly, in these locations, sales are not recorded until a retail customer has purchased the goods. In all cases, when a sale is recorded by the company, no significant uncertainty exists surrounding the purchaser's obligation to pay. No right of return exists on sales of equipment. Service parts and certain attachments returns are estimable and accrued at the time a sale is recognized. The company makes appropriate provisions based on experience for costs such as doubtful receivables, sales incentives and product warranty.
Financing revenue is recorded over the lives of related receivables using the interest method. Insurance premiums recorded in other income are generally recognized in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred over the contract period. Deferred costs on the origination of financing receivables are recognized as a reduction in finance revenue over the expected lives of the receivables using the interest method. Income and deferred costs on the origination of operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the scheduled lease terms in finance revenue.
Sales Incentives At the time a sale is recognized, the company records an estimate of the future sales incentive costs for allowances and financing programs that will be due when a dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. The estimate is based on historical data, announced incentive programs, field inventory levels and retail sales volumes.
Product Warranties At the time a sale is recognized, the company records the estimated future warranty costs. These costs are usually estimated based on historical warranty claims (see Note22).
Sales Taxes The company collects and remits taxes assessed by different governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with revenue producing transactions between the company and its customers. These taxes may include sales, use, value-added and some excise taxes. The company reports the collection of these taxes on a net basis (excluded from revenues).
Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs related to the sales of the company's equipment are included in cost of sales.
Advertising Costs Advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred. This expense was $157million in 2015, $174million in 2014 and $183million in 2013.
Depreciation and Amortization Property and equipment, capitalized software and other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. These assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives generally using the straight-line method. Equipment on operating leases is depreciated over the terms of the leases using the straight-line method. Property and equipment expenditures for new and revised products, increased capacity and the replacement or major renewal of significant items are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are generally charged to expense as incurred.
37  Securitization of Receivables Certain financing receivables are periodically transferred to special purpose entities (SPEs) in securitization transactions (see Note13). These securitizations qualify as collateral for secured borrowings and no gains or losses are recognized at the time of securitization. The receivables remain on the balance sheet and are classified as "Financing receivables securitizednet." The company recognizes finance income over the lives of these receivables using the interest method.
Receivables and Allowances All financing and trade receivables are reported on the balance sheet at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs, the allowance for credit losses, and any deferred fees or costs on originated financing receivables. Allowances for credit losses are maintained in amounts considered to be appropriate in relation to the receivables outstanding based on collection experience, economic conditions and credit risk quality. Receivables are written-off to the allowance when the account is considered uncollectible.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets (including property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) when events or circumstances warrant such a review. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually at the end of the third fiscal quarter each year, and more often if events or circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value below the carrying value. Goodwill is allocated and reviewed for impairment by reporting units, which consist primarily of the operating segments and certain other reporting units. The goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides. To test for goodwill impairment, the carrying value of each reporting unit is compared with its fair value. If the carrying value of the goodwill or long-lived asset is considered impaired, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset (see Note5).
Derivative Financial Instruments It is the company's policy that derivative transactions are executed only to manage exposures arising in the normal course of business and not for the purpose of creating speculative positions or trading. The company's financial services manage the relationship of the types and amounts of their funding sources to their receivable and lease portfolio in an effort to diminish risk due to interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, while responding to favorable financing opportunities. The company also has foreign currency exposures at some of its foreign and domestic operations related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies.
All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet. Cash collateral received or paid is not offset against the derivative fair values on the balance sheet. Each derivative is designated as either a cash flow hedge, a fair value hedge, or remains undesignated. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to the income statement when the effects of the item being hedged are recognized in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and effective as fair value hedges are recognized currently in net income. These changes are offset in net income to the extent the hedge was effective by fair value changes related to the risk being hedged on the hedged item. Changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges are recognized currently in the income statement. All ineffective changes in derivative fair values are recognized currently in net income.
All designated hedges are formally documented as to the relationship with the hedged item as well as the risk-management strategy. Both at inception and on an ongoing basis the hedging instrument is assessed as to its effectiveness. If and when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge, the underlying hedged transaction is no longer likely to occur, the hedge designation is removed, or the derivative is terminated, the hedge accounting discussed above is discontinued (see Note27).
Foreign Currency Translation The functional currencies for most of the company's foreign operations are their respective local currencies. The assets and liabilities of these operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the end of the period exchange rates. The revenues and expenses are translated at weighted-average rates for the period. The gains or losses from these translations are recorded in other comprehensive income. Gains or losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary involved and foreign exchange forward contracts are included in net income. The pretax net gain (loss) for foreign exchange in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $22million, $(47)million and $(26)million, respectively.
3. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS New Accounting Standards Adopted In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.2015-04, Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employer's Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets, which amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 715, CompensationRetirement Benefits. This ASU provides a practical expedient for entities whose fiscal year end does not coincide with a month end. The practical expedient permits defined benefit plan assets and obligations to be measured using the month end that is closest to the entity's fiscal year end. Early adoption is permitted. The company early adopted this ASU in the fourth quarter of 2015. As a result, pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and liabilities were measured as of October31, 2015. The adoption did not have a material effect on the company's consolidated financial statements.
In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.2015-07, Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent), which amends ASC820, Fair Value Measurement. This ASU removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy investments without readily determinable fair values in entities that elect to measure fair value using net asset value per share or its equivalent. The ASU requires that these investments continue to be shown in the investment disclosure amount to allow the disclosure to reconcile to the investment amount presented in the balance   38  sheet. The ASU was early adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and was applied retrospectively (see pension and health care assets in Note7). The adoption did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
New Accounting Standards to be Adopted In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC605, Revenue Recognition. This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.2015-14, Deferral of the Effective Date, which amends ASU No.2014-09. As a result, the effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The adoption will use one of two retrospective application methods. The company has not determined the potential effects on the consolidated financial statements.
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period, which amends ASC718, CompensationStock Compensation. This ASU requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. Therefore, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. The total compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The adoption will not have a material effect on the company's consolidated financial statements.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which amends ASC835-30, InterestImputation of Interest. This ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to borrowings be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the borrowing. This treatment is consistent with debt discounts. The ASU does not affect the amount or timing of expenses for debt issuance costs. The effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and will be applied retrospectively. The adoption will not have a material effect on the company's consolidated financial statements.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.2015-05, Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement, which amends ASC350-40, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software. This ASU provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If an arrangement includes a software license, the accounting for the license will be consistent with licenses of other intangible assets. If the arrangement does not include a license, the arrangement will be accounted for as a service contract. The effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and will be adopted prospectively. The adoption will not have a material effect on the company's consolidated financial statements.
In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.2015-09, Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts, which amends ASC944, Financial ServicesInsurance. This ASU requires disclosure of additional information about unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses, including a rollforward of the liability of the claims adjustment liability. The effective date will be the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. The adoption will not have a material effect on the company's consolidated financial statements.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which amends ASC330, Inventory. This ASU simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory by using only the lower of cost or net realizable value. The ASU does not apply to inventory measured using the last-in, first-out method. The effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 with early adoption permitted. The adoption will not have a material effect on the company's consolidated financial statements.
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements, which amends ASC835-30, InterestImputation of Interest. This ASU clarifies the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with lines of credit. These costs may be presented as an asset and amortized ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are outstanding borrowings on the arrangement. The effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and will be applied retrospectively. The adoption will not have a material effect on the company's consolidated financial statements.
4. DISPOSITIONS In March 2015, the company closed the sale of all of the stock of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, John Deere Insurance Company and John Deere Risk Protection, Inc. (collectively the Crop Insurance operations) to Farmers Mutual Hail Insurance Company of Iowa. These operations were included in the company's financial services operating segment. At January31, 2015, the total assets of $381million and liabilities of $267million were classified as held for sale in the consolidated financial statements, which consisted of $13million of cash and cash equivalents, $79million of marketable securities, $265million of other receivables, $4million of other intangible assets-net and $20million of other assets. The related liabilities held for sale consisted of accounts payable and accrued expenses. The total amount of proceeds from the sale was approximately $154million, including $5million of cash and cash equivalents sold, with a gain recorded in other income of $42million pretax and $40million after-tax. The tax expense was partially offset by a change in a valuation allowance on a capital loss carryforward.
39  The company provided certain business services for a fee during a transition period.
In May 2014, the company closed the sale of the stock and certain assets of the entities that compose the company's Water operations to FIMI Opportunity Funds. The sale was the result of the company's intention to invest its resources in growing core businesses. At April30, 2014, the total assets of $85million and liabilities of $50million were classified as held for sale in the consolidated financial statements, which consisted of $57million of trade receivables, $10million of other receivables, $49million of inventories and $5million of other assets less a $36million asset impairment. The related liabilities held for sale consisted of accounts payable and accrued expenses of $47million and retirement benefits and other liabilities of $3million. The total amount of proceeds from the sale was approximately $35million with a loss recorded in other operating expenses of $10million pretax and after-tax in addition to the impairments recorded (see Note5). The company provided certain business services for a fee during a transition period.
In December 2013, the company closed the sale of 60percent of its subsidiary John Deere Landscapes, LLC (Landscapes) to a private equity investment firm affiliated with Clayton, Dubilier& Rice, LLC (CD&R). At October31, 2013, the total assets of $505million and liabilities of $120million for these operations were classified as held for sale in the consolidated financial statements and written down to realizable value, which consisted of $153million of trade receivables, $219million of inventories, $37million of property and equipment, $106million of goodwill, $25million of other intangible assets and $10million of other assets less a $45million asset impairment. The related liabilities held for sale consisted of accounts payable and accrued expenses. The total amount of proceeds from the sale at closing was approximately $305million with no significant gain or loss, which consisted of $174million equity contribution and third party debt raised by Landscapes.
The equity contribution was in the form of newly issued cumulative convertible participating preferred units representing 60percent of the voting rights (on an as converted basis), which rank senior to the company's investment in Landscapes common stock as to dividends. The preferred units had an initial liquidation preference of $174million and accrue dividends at a rate of 12percent per annum. The liquidation preference is subject to the company's rights under the stockholders agreement. Due to preferred dividend payment in additional preferred shares over the first two years, CD&R's ownership increased over the two-year period.
The company initially retained 40percent of the Landscapes business in the form of common stock. As of January 2014, the company deconsolidated Landscapes and began reporting the results as an equity investment in unconsolidated affiliates. Due to the company's continuing involvement through its initial 40percent interest, Landscapes' historical operating results are presented in continuing operations. Landscapes was rebranded to SiteOne Landscapes Supply, Inc. during 2015.
5. SPECIAL ITEMS Impairments In the fourth quarter of 2014, the company recorded non-cash charges in cost of sales for the impairment of long-lived assets of $18million and other assets of $16million pretax and after-tax. The assets are part of the company's agriculture and turf operations in China. The impairment is the result of a decline in forecasted financial performance that indicated it was probable the future cash flows would not cover the carrying amount of assets used to manufacture agricultural equipment in that country (see Note26).
In 2014, the company recorded non-cash charges of $62million pretax, or $30million after-tax, related to the Water operations. In the first quarter, a $26million pretax and after-tax loss was recorded in cost of sales for the impairment of long-lived assets. In the second quarter, an additional non-cash charge of $36million pretax, or $4million after-tax, was recorded in other operating expenses for an impairment to write the Water operations down to fair value less costs to sell. The tax benefits recognized resulted primarily from a change in valuation allowances of the Water operations. These operations were included in the company's agriculture and turf operating segment (see Note26).
In 2013, the company recorded a non-cash charge for the impairment of long-lived assets of $57million pretax, or $51million after-tax. This consists of $50million pretax, or $44million after-tax, in the third quarter and $7million pretax and after-tax in the fourth quarter, related to the company's Water operations, which were included in the agriculture and turf operating segment. The total pretax impairment loss consisted of $50million recorded in cost of sales and $7million in selling, administrative and general expenses. The impairments were due to a decline in the forecasted financial performance and a review of strategic options for the business (see Note26).
In the fourth quarter of 2013, the company recorded a non-cash charge of $45million pretax and after-tax in other operating expenses for an impairment to write the Landscapes operations down to realizable value. These operations were included in the agriculture and turf operating segment (see Note4).
6. CASH FLOW INFORMATION For purposes of the statement of consolidated cash flows, the company considers investments with purchased maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Substantially all of the company's short-term borrowings, excluding the current maturities of long-term borrowings, mature or may require payment within three months or less.
The equipment operations sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to financial services. These intercompany cash flows are eliminated in the consolidated cash flows.
All cash flows from the changes in trade accounts and notes receivable (see Note12) are classified as operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows as these receivables arise from sales to the company's customers. Cash flows from financing receivables that are related to sales to the company's customers (see Note12) are also included in operating activities. The remaining financing receivables are   40  related to the financing of equipment sold by independent dealers and are included in investing activities.
The company had the following non-cash operating and investing activities that were not included in the statement of consolidated cash flows. The company transferred inventory to equipment on operating leases of $674million, $794million and $659million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The company also had accounts payable related to purchases of property and equipment of $89million, $128million and $198million at October31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
Cash payments for interest and income taxes consisted of the following in millions of dollars:            2015 2014 2013            Interest: Equipment operations $ 471 $ 506 $ 511 Financial services 443 454 502 Intercompany eliminations (253 ) (268 ) (247 )            Consolidated $ 661 $ 692 $ 766                                  Income taxes: Equipment operations $ 828 $ 1,640 $ 1,863 Financial services 190 333 270 Intercompany eliminations (117 ) (253 ) (179 )            Consolidated $ 901 $ 1,720 $ 1,954                                             7. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS The company has several defined benefit pension plans and postretirement health care and life insurance plans covering its U.S. employees and employees in certain foreign countries. The company uses an October31 measurement date for these plans.
The components of net periodic pension cost and the assumptions related to the cost consisted of the following in millions of dollars and in percents:            2015 2014 2013            Pensions Service cost $ 282 $ 244 $ 273 Interest cost 474 480 439 Expected return on plan assets (769 ) (776 ) (778 ) Amortization of actuarial loss 223 177 265 Amortization of prior service cost 25 25 12 Other postemployment benefits 1 5 Settlements/curtailments 11 9 2            Net cost $ 247 $ 164 $ 213                                  Weighted-average assumptions Discount rates 4.0% 4.5% 3.8% Rate of compensation increase 3.8% 3.8% 3.9% Expected long-term rates of return 7.3% 7.5% 7.8%            The components of net periodic postretirement benefits cost and the assumptions related to the cost consisted of the following in millions of dollars and in percents:            2015 2014 2013            Health care and life insurance Service cost $ 46 $ 44 $ 58 Interest cost 259 267 255 Expected return on plan assets (55 ) (72 ) (84 ) Amortization of actuarial loss 91 33 141 Amortization of prior service credit (77 ) (3 ) (8 ) Settlements/curtailments 1 (1 )            Net cost $ 265 $ 268 $ 362                                  Weighted-average assumptions Discount rates 4.2% 4.7% 3.8% Expected long-term rates of return 7.0% 7.2% 7.5%            The previous pension cost in net income and other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations in other comprehensive income in millions of dollars were as follows:            2015 2014 2013            Pensions Net cost $ 247 $ 164 $ 213 Retirement benefit adjustments included in other comprehensive (income)loss: Net actuarial (gain) loss 361 940 (1,481 ) Prior service (credit) cost 66 (26 ) Amortization of actuarial loss (223 ) (177 ) (265 ) Amortization of prior service cost (25 ) (25 ) (12 ) Settlements/curtailments (11 ) (9 ) (2 )            Total (gain) loss recognized in other comprehensive (income)loss 168 729 (1,786 )            Total recognized in comprehensive (income) loss $ 415 $ 893 $ (1,573 )                                             The previous postretirement benefits cost in net income and other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations in other comprehensive income in millions of dollars were as follows:            2015 2014 2013            Health care and life insurance Net cost $ 265 $ 268 $ 362 Retirement benefit adjustments included in other comprehensive (income)loss: Net actuarial (gain) loss (141 ) 748 (1,165 ) Prior service credit (3 ) (370 ) (2 ) Amortization of actuarial loss (91 ) (33 ) (141 ) Amortization of prior service credit 77 3 8 Settlements/curtailments (2 ) 1            Total (gain) loss recognized in other comprehensive (income)loss (160 ) 349 (1,300 )            Total recognized in comprehensive (income) loss $ 105 $ 617 $ (938 )                                               41  The benefit plan obligations, funded status and the assumptions related to the obligations at October31 in millions of dollars follow:               Pensions Health Care and Life Insurance 2015 2014 2015 2014               Change in benefit obligations Beginning of year balance $ (12,190 ) $ (10,968 ) $ (6,304 ) $ (5,926 ) Service cost (282 ) (244 ) (46 ) (44 ) Interest cost (474 ) (480 ) (259 ) (267 ) Actuarial gain (loss) (174 ) (1,306 ) 172 (757 ) Amendments (66 ) 3 370 Benefits paid 781 675 344 336 Health care subsidies (20 ) (22 ) Other postemployment benefits (1 ) (5 ) Settlements/curtailments 2 2 1 Foreign exchange and other 218 136 25 6               End of year balance (12,186 ) (12,190 ) (6,084 ) (6,304 )               Change in plan assets (fairvalue) Beginning of year balance 11,447 11,008 957 1,157 Actual return on plan assets 582 1,132 24 81 Employer contribution 83 87 48 51 Benefits paid (781 ) (675 ) (344 ) (336 ) Settlements/curtailments (2 ) (2 ) Foreign exchange and other (165 ) (103 ) 4 4               End of year balance 11,164 11,447 689 957               Funded status $ (1,022 ) $ (743 ) $ (5,395 ) $ (5,347 )                                           Weighted-average assumptions Discount rates 4.1% 4.0% 4.3% 4.2% Rate of compensation increase 3.8% 3.8%               In the fourth quarter of 2015, the company decided to transition Medicare eligible wage and certain Medicare eligible salaried retirees to a Medicare Advantage plan offered by a private insurance company. This transition, which will take effect in January 2016, will not affect the participants' level of benefits and is expected to result in future cost savings for the company.
In the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2014, the company updated mortality assumptions based on tables issued by the Society of Actuaries.
For Medicare eligible salaried retirees that primarily retire after July1, 1993 and are eligible for postretirement medical benefits, the company's postretirement benefit plan consists of annual Retiree Medical Credits (RMCs). The RMC is a monetary amount provided to the retirees annually to assist with their medical costs. In October 2014, the RMC plan was modified to change the annual cost sharing provisions. Beginning in 2015, the annual RMC amount did not increase and the rate of future changes will continue to be set each year by the company.
The amounts recognized at October31 in millions of dollars consist of the following:               Pensions Health Care and Life Insurance 2015 2014 2015 2014               Amounts recognized in balancesheet Noncurrent asset $ 216 $ 262 Current liability (44 ) (51 ) $ (20 ) $ (21 ) Noncurrent liability (1,194 ) (954 ) (5,375 ) (5,326 )               Total $ (1,022 ) $ (743 ) $ (5,395 ) $ (5,347 )                                           Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive incomepretax Net actuarial loss $ 4,393 $ 4,266 $ 1,442 $ 1,675 Prior service cost (credit) 83 42 (334 ) (407 )               Total $ 4,476 $ 4,308 $ 1,108 $ 1,268                                                         The total accumulated benefit obligations for all pension plans at October31, 2015 and 2014 was $11,508million and $11,425million, respectively.
The accumulated benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $7,254million and $6,669million, respectively, at October31, 2015 and $1,381million and $916million, respectively, at October31, 2014. The projected benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $8,196million and $6,958million, respectively, at October31, 2015 and $8,213million and $7,208million, respectively, at October31, 2014.
The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income that are expected to be amortized as net expense (income) during fiscal 2016 in millions of dollars follow:        Pensions  Health Care and LifeInsurance        Net actuarial loss   $ 208    $ 75   Prior service cost (credit)   16    (78 )            Total   $ 224    $ (3 )                                      Actuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). To the extent unamortized gains and losses exceed 10% of the higher of the market-related value of assets or the benefit obligation, the excess is amortized as a component of net periodic cost over the remaining service period of the active participants. For plans in which all or almost all of the plan's participants are inactive, the amortization period is the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants.
The company expects to contribute approximately $73million to its pension plans and approximately $25million to its health care and life insurance plans in 2016, which are primarily direct benefit payments for unfunded plans.
42  The benefits expected to be paid from the benefit plans, which reflect expected future years of service, are as follows in millions of dollars:         Pensions Health Care and LifeInsurance*         2016 $ 697 $ 317 2017 688 333 2018 685 339 2019 690 342 2020 694 344 2021 to 2025 3,484 1,766 * Net of prescription drug group benefit subsidy under Medicare PartD.
The annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits (the health care cost trend rates) used to determine accumulated postretirement benefit obligations were based on the trends for medical and prescription drug claims for pre- and post-65 age groups due to the effects of Medicare. At October31, 2015, the weighted-average composite trend rates for these obligations were assumed to be a .8percent increase from 2015 to 2016, followed by an increase of 7.9percent from 2016 to 2017, gradually decreasing to 4.8percent from 2024 to 2025 and all future years. The small estimated increase from 2015 to 2016 resulted from the transition to the Medicare Advantage plan in January 2016. The obligations at October31, 2014 and the cost in 2015 assumed a 6.2percent increase from 2014 to 2015, gradually decreasing to 5.0percent from 2022 to 2023 and all future years. An increase of one percentage point in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations by $807million and the aggregate of service and interest cost component of net periodic postretirement benefits cost for the year by $45million. A decrease of one percentage point would decrease the obligations by $619million and the cost by $34million.
The discount rate assumptions used to determine the postretirement obligations at October31, 2015 and 2014 were based on hypothetical AA yield curves represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates. These discount rates represent the rates at which the company's benefit obligations could effectively be settled at the October31 measurement dates.
Beginning in 2016, the company will change the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The new method uses the spot yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligations to relevant projected cash outflows. Previously, those costs were determined using a single weighted-average discount rate. The change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offsets in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. The new method provides a more precise measure of interest and service costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates. The company will account for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016. See "Postretirement Benefit Obligations" in Critical Accounting Policies for additional details.

*** Investments are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient, and therefore, are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.
Fair values are determined as follows: Cash and Short-Term Investments Includes accounts that are valued based on the account value, which approximates fair value, and investment funds that are valued on the fund's net asset value (NAV) based on the fair value of the underlying securities. Also included are securities that are valued using a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
Equity Securities and Funds The values are determined primarily by closing prices in the active market in which the equity investment trades, or the fund's NAV, based on the fair value of the underlying securities.
Fixed Income Securities and Funds The securities are valued using either a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, credit risk and prepayment speeds, or they are valued using the closing prices in the active market in which the fixed income investment trades. Fixed income funds are valued using the NAV, based on the fair value of the underlying securities or closing prices in the active market in which the investment trades.
Real Estate, Venture Capital, Private Equity, Hedge Funds and Other The investments, which are structured as limited partnerships, are valued at estimated fair value based on their proportionate share of the limited partnership's fair value that is determined by the general partner. The general partner values these investments using a combination of NAV, an income approach (primarily estimated cash flows discounted over the expected holding period), or market approach (primarily the valuation of similar securities and properties). Real estate investment trusts are primarily valued at the closing prices in the active markets in which the investment trades. Real estate investment funds and other investments are primarily valued at NAV, based on the fair value of the underlying securities.
Interest Rate, Foreign Currency and Other Derivative Instruments The derivatives are valued using either an income approach (discounted cash flow) using market observable inputs, including swap curves and both forward and spot exchange rates, or a market approach (closing prices in the active market in which the derivative instrument trades).
The primary investment objective for the pension and health care plans assets is to maximize the growth of these assets to support the projected obligations to the beneficiaries over a long period of time, and to do so in a manner that is consistent with the company's risk tolerance. The asset allocation policy is the most important decision in managing the assets and it is reviewed regularly. The asset allocation policy considers the long-term asset class risk/return expectations since the obligations are long-term in nature. The current target allocations for pension assets are approximately 49percent for equity securities, 24percent for debt securities, 5percent for real estate and 22percent for other investments. The target allocations for health care assets are approximately 53percent for equity securities, 28percent for debt securities, 4percent for real estate and 15percent for other investments. The allocation percentages above include the effects of combining derivatives with other investments to manage asset allocations and exposures to interest rates and foreign currency exchange. The assets are well diversified and are managed by professional investment firms as well as by investment professionals who are company employees. As a result of the company's diversified investment policy, there were no significant concentrations of risk.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects management's expectations of long-term average rates of return on funds invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. A market related value of plan assets is used to calculate the expected return on assets. The market related value recognizes changes in the fair value of pension plan assets systematically over a five-year period. The market related value of the health care and life insurance plan assets equal fair value. The expected return is based on the outlook for inflation and for returns in multiple asset classes, while also considering historical returns, asset allocation and investment strategy. The company's approach has emphasized the long-term nature of the return estimate such that the return assumption is not changed significantly unless there are fundamental changes in capital markets that affect the company's expectations for returns over an extended period of time (i.e., 10 to 20years). The average annual return of the company's U.S. pension fund was approximately 8.0percent during the past ten years and approximately 9.0percent during the past 20years. Since return premiums over inflation and total returns for major asset classes vary widely even over ten-year periods, recent history is not necessarily indicative of   45  long-term future expected returns. The company's systematic methodology for determining the long-term rate of return for the company's investment strategies supports the long-term expected return assumptions.
The company has created certain Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association trusts (VEBAs) for the funding of postretirement health care benefits. The future expected asset returns for these VEBAs are lower than the expected return on the other pension and health care plan assets due to investment in a higher proportion of liquid securities. These assets are in addition to the other postretirement health care plan assets that have been funded under Section401(h) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and maintained in a separate account in the company's pension plan trust.
The company has defined contribution plans related to employee investment and savings plans primarily in the U.S. The company's contributions and costs under these plans were $185million in 2015, $184million in 2014 and $178million in 2013. The contribution rate varies primarily based on the company's performance in the prior year and employee participation in the plans.
8. INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes by taxing jurisdiction and by significant component consisted of the following in millions of dollars:            2015 2014 2013            Current: U.S.: Federal $ 377 $ 1,217 $ 1,405 State 32 126 145 Foreign 449 564 569            Total current 858 1,907 2,119            Deferred: U.S.: Federal 21 (189 ) (117 ) State 4 (11 ) (11 ) Foreign (43 ) (80 ) (45 )            Total deferred (18 ) (280 ) (173 )            Provision for income taxes $ 840 $ 1,627 $ 1,946                                             Based upon the location of the company's operations, the consolidated income before income taxes in the U.S. in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $1,838million, $3,219million and $4,124million, respectively, and in foreign countries was $942million, $1,578million and $1,359million, respectively. Certain foreign operations are branches of Deere& Company and are subject to U.S. as well as foreign income tax regulations. The pretax income by location and the preceding analysis of the income tax provision by taxing jurisdiction are not directly related.
A comparison of the statutory and effective income tax provision and reasons for related differences in millions of dollars follow:            2015 2014 2013            U.S. federal income tax provision at a statutory rate of 35percent $ 973 $ 1,679 $ 1,919 Increase (decrease) resulting from: State and local income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit 23 75 87 German branch deferred tax write-off 56 Differences in taxability of foreign(earnings)losses (449 ) (305 ) 43 Nondeductible impairment charges 32 29 Research and business tax credits (76 ) (99 ) (56 ) Tax rates on foreign earnings (36 ) (71 ) (34 ) Valuation allowance on deferred taxes 384 454 (14 ) Othernet 21 (138 ) (84 )            Provision for income taxes $ 840 $ 1,627 $ 1,946                                             At October31, 2015, accumulated earnings in certain subsidiaries outside the U.S. totaled $5,282million for which no provision for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes has been made, because it is expected that such earnings will be reinvested outside the U.S. indefinitely. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable. At October31, 2015, the amount of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held by these foreign subsidiaries was $1,588million.
Deferred income taxes arise because there are certain items that are treated differently for financial accounting than for income tax reporting purposes. An analysis of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities at October31 in millions of dollars follows:            2015  2014   Deferred Tax Assets  Deferred Tax Liabilities  Deferred Tax Assets  Deferred Tax Liabilities            Other postretirement benefitliabilities   $ 1,972       $ 1,968      Tax over book depreciation      $ 574       $ 542   Accrual for sales allowances   618       654      Lease transactions      528       404   Tax loss and tax creditcarryforwards   604       514      Foreign unrealized losses   458       146      Pension liabilitynet   315       160      Accrual for employee benefits   172       229      Share-based compensation   141       145      Inventory         22      Goodwill and other intangibleassets      80       89   Allowance for credit losses   72       73      Deferred gains on distributed foreign earnings   33       32      Deferred compensation   51       47      Undistributed foreign earnings      25       26   Other items   436    119    440    116   Less valuation allowances   (940 )      (637 )                       Deferred income tax assets andliabilities   $ 3,932    $ 1,326    $ 3,793    $ 1,177                                                                     46  Deere& Company files a consolidated federal income tax return in the U.S., which includes the wholly-owned financial services subsidiaries. These subsidiaries account for income taxes generally as if they filed separate income tax returns.
At October31, 2015, certain tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of $604million, of which $88million are capital losses, were available with $226million expiring from 2016 through 2035 and $378million with an indefinite carryforward period.
In March 2013, the company changed the corporate structure of most of its German operations from a branch to a subsidiary of Deere& Company. The change provides the company increased flexibility and efficiency in funding growth in international operations. As a result, the tax status of these operations changed. Formerly, as a branch these earnings were taxable in the U.S. as earned. As a subsidiary, these earnings are now taxable in the U.S. if they are distributed to Deere& Company as dividends, which is the same as the company's other foreign subsidiaries. The earnings of the new German subsidiary remain taxable in Germany. Due to the change in tax status and the expectation that the German subsidiary's earnings are indefinitely reinvested, the deferred tax assets and liabilities related to U.S. taxable temporary differences for the previous German branch were written off. The effect of this write-off was a decrease in net deferred tax assets and a charge to the income tax provision of $56million during the second fiscal quarter of 2013.
A reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at October31 in millions of dollars follows:            2015 2014 2013            Beginning of year balance $ 213 $ 272 $ 265 Increases to tax positions taken during the current year 32 28 30 Increases to tax positions taken during prioryears 29 20 24 Decreases to tax positions taken during prioryears (15 ) (84 ) (51 ) Decreases due to lapse of statute oflimitations (11 ) (4 ) (5 ) Settlements (6 ) Foreign exchange (13 ) (19 ) 9            End of year balance $ 229 $ 213 $ 272                                             The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at October31, 2015 that would affect the effective tax rate if the tax benefits were recognized was $79million. The remaining liability was related to tax positions for which there are offsetting tax receivables, or the uncertainty was only related to timing. The company expects that any reasonably possible change in the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months would not be significant.
The company files its tax returns according to the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates, which includes the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has completed the examination of the company's federal income tax returns for periods prior to 2009. The years 2009 through 2012 federal income tax returns are currently under examination. Various state and foreign income tax returns, including major tax jurisdictions in Canada and Germany, also remain subject to examination by taxing authorities.
The company's policy is to recognize interest related to income taxes in interest expense and interest income, and recognize penalties in selling, administrative and general expenses. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, the total amount of expense from interest and penalties was $23million, $11million and $9million and the interest income was $3million, $4million and $4million, respectively. At October31, 2015 and 2014, the liability for accrued interest and penalties totaled $69million and $54million and the receivable for interest was $2million and $2million, respectively.
9. OTHER INCOME AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES The major components of other income and other operating expenses consisted of the following in millions of dollars:            2015 2014 2013            Other income Insurance premiums and fees earned $ 173 $ 297 $ 252 Revenues from services 280 276 256 Investment income 26 17 15 Other 228 234 159            Total $ 707 $ 824 $ 682                                  Other operating expenses Depreciation of equipment on operatingleases $ 577 $ 494 $ 389 Insurance claims and expenses 183 324 204 Cost of services 160 151 143 Other 41 124 85            Total $ 961 $ 1,093 $ 821                                             The company offers extended equipment warranties and, prior to the divestiture of the crop insurance subsidiaries (see Note4), issued crop insurance policies. To limit losses and reduce exposure to crop insurance claims, the company utilized reinsurance. Although reinsurance contracts permitted recovery of certain claims from reinsurers, the insurance subsidiary was not relieved of its primary obligation to the policyholders. The premiums ceded by the crop insurance subsidiary in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $54million, $288million and $337million, and claims recoveries on the ceded business were $65million, $304million and $294million, respectively. The amounts from reinsurance are netted against the insurance premiums and fees earned and the insurance claims and expenses in the table above.
10. UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATED COMPANIES Unconsolidated affiliated companies are companies in which Deere& Company generally owns 20percent to 50percent of the outstanding voting shares. Deere& Company does not control these companies and accounts for its investments in them on the equity basis. The investments in these companies primarily consist of Bell Equipment Limited (32percent ownership), Deere-Hitachi Construction Machinery Corporation (50percent ownership), Deere-Hitachi Mquinas de Construo do Brasil S.A. (50percent ownership) and SiteOne Landscapes Supply, LLC. (35percent ownership). The unconsolidated affiliated companies primarily manufacture or market equipment and landscapes products. Deere& Company's share of   47  the income or loss of these companies is reported in the consolidated income statement under "Equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates." The investment in these companies is reported in the consolidated balance sheet under "Investments in unconsolidated affiliates." Combined financial information of the unconsolidated affiliated companies in millions of dollars follows:            Operations 2015 2014 2013            Sales $ 3,290 $ 3,082 $ 2,299 Net income 23 1 10 Deere& Company's equity in netincome(loss) 1 (8 )            Financial Position 2015 2014            Total assets $ 2,139 $ 2,101 Total external borrowings 660 648 Total net assets 878 842 Deere& Company's share of the net assets 303 303            Consolidated retained earnings at October31, 2015 include undistributed earnings of the unconsolidated affiliates of $165million. Dividends from unconsolidated affiliates were $1million in 2015, $1million in 2014 and $10million in 2013.
In the ordinary course of business, the company purchases components and finished goods and sells these products to the unconsolidated affiliated companies. Transactions with unconsolidated affiliated companies reported in the statement of consolidated income in millions of dollars follow:            2015 2014 2013            Net sales $ 37 $ 39 $ 54 Purchases 1,284 1,415 1,427            11. MARKETABLE SECURITIES All marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a component of stockholders' equity. Realized gains or losses from the sales of marketable securities are based on the specific identification method.
The amortized cost and fair value of marketable securities at October31 in millions of dollars follow:               Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value               2015 Equity fund $ 38 $ 5 $ 43 U.S. government debt securities 79 3 82 Municipal debt securities 29 2 31 Corporate debt securities 121 4 $ 1 124 International debt securities 48 1 47 Mortgage-backed securities* 108 3 1 110               Marketable securities $ 423 $ 17 $ 3 $ 437                                           * Primarily issued by U.S. government sponsored enterprises.

The contractual maturities of debt securities at October31, 2015 in millions of dollars follow:        Amortized Cost  Fair Value        Due in one year or less   $ 51    $ 50   Due after one through five years   88    91   Due after five through 10years   99    101   Due after 10years   40    42   Mortgage-backed securities   108    110             Debt securities   $ 386    $ 394                                       Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some securities may be called or prepaid. Because of the potential for prepayment on mortgage-backed securities, they are not categorized by contractual maturity. Proceeds from the sales of available-for-sale securities were $120million in 2015, $6million in 2014 and $7million in 2013. Realized gains, realized losses, the increase (decrease) in net unrealized gains or losses and unrealized losses that have been continuous for over twelve months were not significant in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Unrealized losses at October31, 2015 and 2014 were primarily the result of an increase in interest rates and were not recognized in income due to the ability and intent to hold to maturity. There were no significant impairment write-downs in the periods reported.

RECEIVABLES Trade Accounts and Notes Receivable Trade accounts and notes receivable at October31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars:         2015 2014         Trade accounts and notes: Agriculture and turf $ 2,278 $ 2,633 Construction and forestry 773 645         Trade accounts and notes receivablenet $ 3,051 $ 3,278                                 At October31, 2015 and 2014, dealer notes included in the previous table were $90million and $61million, and the allowance for credit losses was $41million and $55million, respectively.
The equipment operations sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to financial services and provide compensation to these operations at approximate market rates of interest.
48  Trade accounts and notes receivable primarily arise from sales of goods to independent dealers. Under the terms of the sales to dealers, interest is primarily charged to dealers on outstanding balances, from the earlier of the date when goods are sold to retail customers by the dealer or the expiration of certain interest-free periods granted at the time of the sale to the dealer, until payment is received by the company. Dealers cannot cancel purchases after the equipment is shipped and are responsible for payment even if the equipment is not sold to retail customers. The interest-free periods are determined based on the type of equipment sold and the time of year of the sale. These periods range from one to twelve months for most equipment. Interest-free periods may not be extended. Interest charged may not be forgiven and the past due interest rates exceed market rates. The company evaluates and assesses dealers on an ongoing basis as to their creditworthiness and generally retains a security interest in the goods associated with the trade receivables. The company is obligated to repurchase goods sold to a dealer upon cancellation or termination of the dealer's contract for such causes as change in ownership and closeout of the business.
Trade accounts and notes receivable have significant concentrations of credit risk in the agriculture and turf sector and construction and forestry sector as shown in the previous table. On a geographic basis, there is not a disproportionate concentration of credit risk in any area.
Financing Receivables Financing receivables at October31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars:            2015  2014   Unrestricted/Securitized  Unrestricted/Securitized            Retail notes:      Equipment:      Agriculture and turf  $ 15,359  $ 4,236  $ 16,970  $ 3,975  Construction and forestry  2,086  686  1,951  697            Total  17,445  4,922  18,921  4,672  Wholesale notes  4,269   5,390   Revolving charge accounts  2,740   2,603   Financing leases (direct and sales-type)  1,333   1,558             Total financing receivables  25,787  4,922  28,472  4,672            Less:      Unearned finance income:      Equipment notes  726  74  753  56  Financing leases  108   136             Total  834  74  889  56            Allowance for credit losses  144  13  161  14            Financing receivablesnet  $ 24,809  $ 4,835  $ 27,422  $ 4,602                                          The residual values for investments in financing leases at October31, 2015 and 2014 totaled $115million and $112million, respectively.
Financing receivables have significant concentrations of credit risk in the agriculture and turf sector and construction and forestry sector as shown in the previous table. On a geographic basis, there is not a disproportionate concentration of credit risk in any area. The company generally retains as collateral a security interest in the equipment associated with retail notes, wholesale notes and financing leases.
Financing receivables at October31 related to the company's sales of equipment that were included in the table above consisted of the following in millions of dollars:        2015  2014   Unrestricted  Unrestricted        Retail notes*:        Equipment:        Agriculture and turf   $ 1,792    $ 2,125   Construction and forestry   356    403             Total   2,148    2,528   Wholesale notes   4,269    5,390   Sales-type leases   690    844             Total   7,107    8,762             Less:        Unearned finance income:        Equipment notes   178    212   Sales-type leases   45    57             Total   223    269             Financing receivables related to the company's sales of equipment   $ 6,884    $ 8,493                                  * These retail notes generally arise from sales of equipment by company-owned dealers or through direct sales.
Financing receivable installments, including unearned finance income, at October31 are scheduled as follows in millions of dollars:            2015  2014   Unrestricted/Securitized  Unrestricted/Securitized            Due in months:      012  $ 13,006  $ 2,057  $ 14,357  $ 1,878  1324  4,987  1,418  5,254  1,331  2536  3,719  921  4,053  880  3748  2,444  426  2,819  457  4960  1,283  95  1,575  120  Thereafter  348  5  414  6            Total  $ 25,787  $ 4,922  $ 28,472  $ 4,672                                          The maximum terms for retail notes are generally seven years for agriculture and turf equipment and five years for construction and forestry equipment. The maximum term for financing leases is generally five years, while the average term for wholesale notes is less than twelve months.
At October31, 2015 and 2014, the unpaid balances of receivables administered but not owned were $22million and $54million, respectively. At October31, 2015 and 2014, worldwide financing receivables administered, which include financing receivables administered but not owned, totaled $29,666million and $32,078million, respectively.
Past due balances of financing receivables still accruing finance income represent the total balance held (principal plus accrued interest) with any payment amounts 30days or more past the contractual payment due date. Non-performing financing receivables represent loans for which the company has ceased accruing finance income. These receivables are generally 120days delinquent and the estimated uncollectible amount, after charging the dealer's withholding account, has been   49  written off to the allowance for credit losses. Finance income for non-performing receivables is recognized on a cash basis. Accrual of finance income is generally resumed when the receivable becomes contractually current and collections are reasonably assured.

50  Past-due amounts over 30days represented 1.28percent and .90percent of the receivables financed at October31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The allowance for credit losses represented .53percent and .54percent of financing receivables outstanding at October31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, at October31, 2015 and 2014, the company's financial services operations had $179million and $196million, respectively, of deposits withheld from dealers and merchants available for potential credit losses.
Financing receivables are considered impaired when it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms. Receivables reviewed for impairment generally include those that are either past due, or have provided bankruptcy notification, or require significant collection efforts. Receivables, which are impaired, are generally classified as non-performing.

*** Primarily retail notes and wholesale receivables.
A troubled debt restructuring is generally the modification of debt in which a creditor grants a concession it would not otherwise consider to a debtor that is experiencing financial difficulties. These modifications may include a reduction of the stated interest rate, an extension of the maturity dates, a reduction of the face amount or maturity amount of the debt, or a reduction of accrued interest. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, the company identified 107, 66 and 92 financing receivable contracts, primarily operating loans and retail notes, as troubled debt restructurings with aggregate balances of $8million, $3million and $16million pre-modification and $7million, $2million and $15million post-modification, respectively. During these same periods, there were no significant troubled debt restructurings that subsequently defaulted and were written off. At October31, 2015, the company had no significant commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose accounts were modified in troubled debt restructurings.
Other Receivables Other receivables at October31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars:         2015 2014         Taxes receivable $ 720 $ 697 Reinsurance receivables 502 Insurance premium receivables 23 Other 271 278         Other receivables $ 991 $ 1,500                                 Reinsurance and insurance premium receivables were associated with the financial services' crop insurance subsidiary (see Note9), which was sold in 2015 (see Note4).
13. SECURITIZATION OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES The company, as a part of its overall funding strategy, periodically transfers certain financing receivables (retail notes) into variable interest entities (VIEs) that are special purpose entities (SPEs), or a non-VIE banking operation, as part of its asset-backed securities programs (securitizations). The structure of these transactions is such that the transfer of the retail notes did not meet the criteria of sales of receivables, and is, therefore, accounted for as a secured borrowing. SPEs utilized in securitizations of retail notes differ from other entities included in the company's consolidated statements because the assets they hold are legally isolated. Use of the assets held by the SPEs or the non-VIE is restricted by terms of the documents governing the securitization transactions.
In securitizations of retail notes related to secured borrowings, the retail notes are transferred to certain SPEs or to a non-VIE banking operation, which in turn issue debt to investors. The debt securities issued to the third party investors result in secured borrowings, which are recorded as "Short-term securitization borrowings" on the consolidated balance sheet. The securitized retail notes are recorded as "Financing receivables securitizednet" on the balance sheet. The total restricted assets on the balance sheet related to these securitizations include the financing receivables securitized less an allowance for credit losses, and other assets primarily representing restricted cash. For those securitizations in which retail notes are transferred into SPEs, the SPEs supporting the secured borrowings are consolidated unless the company does not have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the SPEs' economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the SPEs. No additional support to these SPEs beyond what was previously contractually required has been provided during the reporting periods.
In certain securitizations, the company consolidates the SPEs since it has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the SPEs' economic performance through its role as servicer of all the receivables held by the SPEs, and the obligation through variable interests in the SPEs to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the SPEs. The restricted assets (retail notes securitized, allowance for credit losses and other assets) of the consolidated SPEs totaled $3,006million and $3,011million at   51  October31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The liabilities (short-term securitization borrowings and accrued interest) of these SPEs totaled $2,743million and $2,942million at October31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2015, as part of a receivable transfer, the company retained $228million of securitization borrowings, with a balance of $189million at October31, 2015. This amount is not shown as a liability above as the borrowing is not outstanding to a third party. The credit holders of these SPEs do not have legal recourse to the company's general credit.
In certain securitizations, the company transfers retail notes to a non-VIE banking operation, which is not consolidated since the company does not have a controlling interest in the entity. The company's carrying values and interests related to the securitizations with the unconsolidated non-VIE were restricted assets (retail notes securitized, allowance for credit losses and other assets) of $249million and $368million at October31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The liabilities (short-term securitization borrowings and accrued interest) were $238million and $351million at October31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
In certain securitizations, the company transfers retail notes into bank-sponsored, multi-seller, commercial paper conduits, which are SPEs that are not consolidated. The company does not service a significant portion of the conduits' receivables, and therefore, does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the conduits' economic performance. These conduits provide a funding source to the company (as well as other transferors into the conduit) as they fund the retail notes through the issuance of commercial paper. The company's carrying values and variable interest related to these conduits were restricted assets (retail notes securitized, allowance for credit losses and other assets) of $1,689million and $1,331million at October31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The liabilities (short-term securitization borrowings and accrued interest) related to these conduits were $1,611million and $1,267million at October31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
The company's carrying amount of the liabilities to the unconsolidated conduits, compared to the maximum exposure to loss related to these conduits, which would only be incurred in the event of a complete loss on the restricted assets, was as follows at October31 in millions of dollars:      2015      Carrying value of liabilities $ 1,611 Maximum exposure to loss 1,689      The total assets of unconsolidated VIEs related to securitizations were approximately $54billion at October31, 2015.
The components of consolidated restricted assets related to secured borrowings in securitization transactions at October31 were as follows in millions of dollars:         2015 2014         Financing receivables securitized (retail notes) $ 4,848 $ 4,616 Allowance for credit losses (13 ) (14 ) Other assets 109 108         Total restricted securitized assets $ 4,944 $ 4,710                                 The components of consolidated secured borrowings and other liabilities related to securitizations at October31 were as follows in millions of dollars:         2015 2014         Short-term securitization borrowings $ 4,590 $ 4,559 Accrued interest on borrowings 2 1         Total liabilities related to restricted securitizedassets $ 4,592 $ 4,560                                 The secured borrowings related to these restricted securitized retail notes are obligations that are payable as the retail notes are liquidated. Repayment of the secured borrowings depends primarily on cash flows generated by the restricted assets. Due to the company's short-term credit rating, cash collections from these restricted assets are not required to be placed into a segregated collection account until immediately prior to the time payment is required to the secured creditors. At October31, 2015, the maximum remaining term of all securitized retail notes was approximately six years.
14. EQUIPMENT ON OPERATING LEASES Operating leases arise primarily from the leasing of John Deere equipment to retail customers. Initial lease terms generally range from four to 60months. Net equipment on operating leases at October31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars:         2015 2014         Equipment on operating leases: Agriculture and turf $ 3,909 $ 3,261 Construction and forestry 1,061 755         Equipment on operating leasesnet $ 4,970 $ 4,016                                 The equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the terms of the lease. The accumulated depreciation on this equipment was $793million and $634million at October31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The corresponding depreciation expense was $577million in 2015, $494million in 2014 and $389million in 2013.
Future payments to be received on operating leases totaled $1,704million at October31, 2015 and are scheduled in millions of dollars as follows: 2016$712, 2017$508, 2018$294, 2019$156 and 2020$34.
52  15. INVENTORIES Most inventories owned by Deere& Company and its U.S. equipment subsidiaries are valued at cost, on the "last-in, first-out" (LIFO) basis. Remaining inventories are generally valued at the lower of cost, on the "first-in, first-out" (FIFO) basis, or market. The value of gross inventories on the LIFO basis represented 66percent and 65percent of worldwide gross inventories at FIFO value at October31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The pretax favorable income effects from the liquidation of LIFO inventory during 2015 and 2014 were approximately $22million and $13million, respectively. If all inventories had been valued on a FIFO basis, estimated inventories by major classification at October31 in millions of dollars would have been as follows:         2015 2014         Raw materials and supplies $ 1,559 $ 1,724 Work-in-process 450 654 Finished goods and parts 3,234 3,360         Total FIFO value 5,243 5,738 Less adjustment to LIFO value 1,426 1,528         Inventories $ 3,817 $ 4,210                                 16. PROPERTY AND DEPRECIATION A summary of property and equipment at October31 in millions of dollars follows:         UsefulLives* (Years)  2015  2014        Equipment Operations    Land   $ 114  $ 120 Buildings and building equipment  23  3,016  3,037 Machinery and equipment  11  5,055  5,089 Dies, patterns, tools, etc.

Capitalized interest was $6million, $6million and $13million in the same periods, respectively. The cost of leased property and equipment under capital leases of $27million and $36million and accumulated depreciation of $14million and $15million at October31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is included in property and equipment.
Capitalized software has an estimated useful life of three years. The amounts of total capitalized software costs, including purchased and internally developed software, classified as "Other Assets" at October31, 2015 and 2014 were $934million and $912million, less accumulated amortization of $681million and $656million, respectively. Capitalized interest on software was $2million at October31, 2015. Amortization of these software costs was $103million in 2015, $106million in 2014 and $93million in 2013. The cost of leased software assets under capital leases amounting to $86million and $77million at October31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is included in other assets.
The cost of compliance with foreseeable environmental requirements has been accrued and did not have a material effect on the company's consolidated financial statements.
17. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETSNET The changes in amounts of goodwill by operating segments were as follows in millions of dollars:          Agriculture and Turf  Construction and Forestry  Total          Balance at October31, 2013   $ 302    $ 603   $ 905   Less accumulated impairment losses   60      60                Net balance   242    603   845   Divestiture*   (60 )     (60 )  Translation adjustments and other   (7 )   (47 )  (54 )               Balance at October31, 2014   235    556   791   Less accumulated impairment losses*                       Net balance   235    556   791   Translation adjustments and other   (8 )   (57 )  (65 )               Goodwill at October31, 2015   $ 227    $ 499   $ 726                                           * Accumulated impairment losses were also reduced by $60million related to the sale of the Water operations (see Note4).
The components of other intangible assets are as follows in millions of dollars:          UsefulLives* (Years)  2015  2014          Amortized intangible assets:           Customer lists and relationships   14    $ 23    $ 20   Technology, patents, trademarks and other   17    96    90                 Total at cost      119    110   Less accumulated amortization**      55    45                 Total      64    65                 Unamortized intangible assets:           Licenses         4                 Other intangible assetsnet      $ 64    $ 69                                              * Weighted-averages ** Accumulated amortization at 2015 and 2014 for customer lists and relationships was $10million and $9million and technology, patents, trademarks and other was $45million and $36million, respectively.
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. The amortization of other intangible assets in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $10million, $11million and $22million, respectively. The estimated amortization expense for the next five years is as follows in millions of dollars: 2016$12, 2017$12, 2018$8, 2019$5 and 2020$5.
53  18. TOTAL SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS Total short-term borrowings at October31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars:        2015  2014        Equipment Operations    Commercial paper  $ 225  $ 45  Notes payable to banks  154  146  Long-term borrowings due within one year  86  243        Total  465  434        Financial Services    Commercial paper  2,743  2,588  Notes payable to banks  52  267  Long-term borrowings due within one year*  5,167  4,730        Total  7,962  7,585        Short-term borrowings  8,427  8,019        Financial Services    Short-term securitization borrowings  4,590  4,559        Total short-term borrowings  $ 13,017  $ 12,578                    * Includes unamortized fair value adjustments related to interest rate swaps.
The short-term securitization borrowings for financial services are secured by financing receivables (retail notes) on the balance sheet (see Note13). Although these securitization borrowings are classified as short-term since payment is required if the retail notes are liquidated early, the payment schedule for these borrowings of $4,590million at October31, 2015 based on the expected liquidation of the retail notes in millions of dollars is as follows: 2016$2,337, 2017$1,413, 2018$661, 2019$157, 2020$21 and 2021$1.
The weighted-average interest rates on total short-term borrowings, excluding current maturities of long-term borrowings, at October31, 2015 and 2014 were .9percent and 1.0percent, respectively.
Lines of credit available from U.S. and foreign banks were $7,205million at October31, 2015. At October31, 2015, $4,031million of these worldwide lines of credit were unused. For the purpose of computing the unused credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings, excluding secured borrowings and the current portion of long-term borrowings, were primarily considered to constitute utilization. Included in the above lines of credit were long-term credit facility agreements for $2,900million, expiring in April 2019, and $2,900million, expiring in April2020. The agreements are mutually extendable and the annual facility fees are not significant. These credit agreements require Capital Corporation to maintain its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter and the ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to capital base (total subordinated debt and stockholder's equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than 11 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. The credit agreements also require the equipment operations to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capital (total debt and stockholders' equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) of 65percent or less at the end of each fiscal quarter. Under this provision, the company's excess equity capacity and retained earnings balance free of restriction at October31, 2015 was $8,835million. Alternatively under this provision, the equipment operations had the capacity to incur additional debt of $16,408million at October31, 2015. All of these requirements of the credit agreements have been met during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.
Deere& Company has an agreement with Capital Corporation pursuant to which it has agreed to continue to own, directly or through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, at least 51percent of the voting shares of capital stock of Capital Corporation and to maintain Capital Corporation's consolidated tangible net worth at not less than $50million. This agreement also obligates Deere& Company to make payments to Capital Corporation such that its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter. Deere& Company's obligations to make payments to Capital Corporation under the agreement are independent of whether Capital Corporation is in default on its indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Further, Deere& Company's obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of Capital Corporation's indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Deere& Company's obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of any specific indebtedness, obligation or liability of Capital Corporation and are enforceable only by or in the name of Capital Corporation. No payments were required under this agreement during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.
19. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES Accounts payable and accrued expenses at October31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars:         2015 2014         Equipment Operations Accounts payable: Trade payables $ 1,435 $ 1,661 Dividends payable 193 210 Other 186 208 Accrued expenses: Dealer sales discounts 1,423 1,551 Employee benefits 1,122 1,350 Product warranties 807 809 Unearned revenue 379 355 Other 1,256 1,374         Total 6,801 7,518         Financial Services Accounts payable: Deposits withheld from dealers and merchants 179 196 Other 258 468 Accrued expenses: Unearned revenue 671 647 Accrued interest 111 103 Employee benefits 71 87 Insurance claims reserve* 29 247 Other 192 279         Total 1,511 2,027         Eliminations** 1,001 991         Accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 7,311 $ 8,554                         * See Note9 ** Primarily trade receivable valuation accounts which are reclassified as accrued expenses by the equipment operations as a result of their trade receivables being sold to financial services.

** All interest rates are as of year end.
The approximate principal amounts of the equipment operations' long-term borrowings maturing in each of the next five years in millions of dollars are as follows: 2016$86, 2017$48, 2018$63, 2019$752 and 2020$2. The approximate principal amounts of the financial services' long-term borrowings maturing in each of the next five years in millions of dollars are as follows: 2016$5,159, 2017$5,124, 2018$5,124, 2019$2,876 and 2020$2,394.
21. LEASES At October31, 2015, future minimum lease payments under capital leases amounted to $60million as follows: 2016$37, 2017$13, 2018$4, 2019$3, 2020$2, and later years $1. Total rental expense for operating leases was $200million in 2015, $205million in 2014 and $237million in 2013. At October31, 2015, future minimum lease payments under operating leases amounted to $354million as follows: 2016$98, 2017$72, 2018$53, 2019$40, 2020$31, and later years $60.
22. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The company generally determines its warranty liability by applying historical claims rate experience to the estimated amount of equipment that has been sold and is still under warranty based on dealer inventories and retail sales. The historical claims rate is primarily determined by a review of five-year claims costs and current quality developments.
The premiums for the company's extended warranties are primarily recognized in income in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred over the contract period. The unamortized extended warranty premiums (unearned revenue) included in the following table totaled $454million and $425million at October31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
A reconciliation of the changes in the warranty liability and unearned premiums in millions of dollars follows:        Warranty Liability/ Unearned Premiums   2015  2014        Beginning of year balance  $ 1,234   $ 1,164   Payments  (779 )  (792 )  Amortization of premiums received  (161 )  (142 )  Accruals for warranties  810   797   Premiums received  209   228   Foreign exchange  (52 )  (21 )          End of year balance  $ 1,261   $ 1,234                                 At October31, 2015, the company had approximately $162million of guarantees issued primarily to banks outside the U.S. related to third-party receivables for the retail financing of John Deere equipment. The company may recover a portion of any required payments incurred under these agreements from repossession of the equipment collateralizing the receivables. At October31, 2015, the company had accrued losses of approximately $4million under these agreements. The maximum remaining term of the receivables guaranteed at October31, 2015 was approximately four years.
At October31, 2015, the company had commitments of approximately $165million for the construction and acquisition of property and equipment. At October31, 2015, the company also had pledged or restricted assets of $99million, primarily as collateral for borrowings and restricted other assets. In addition, see Note13 for restricted assets associated with borrowings related to securitizations.
The company also had other miscellaneous contingencies totaling approximately $30million at October31, 2015, for which it believes the probability for payment is substantially remote. The accrued liability for these contingencies was not material at October31, 2015.
The company is subject to various unresolved legal actions which arise in the normal course of its business, the most prevalent of which relate to product liability (including asbestos related liability), retail credit, employment, software licensing, patent, trademark and environmental matters. The company believes the reasonably possible range of losses for these unresolved legal actions in addition to the amounts accrued would not have a material effect on its financial statements.
55  23. CAPITAL STOCK Changes in the common stock account in millions were as follows:         Numberof SharesIssued Amount         Balance at October31, 2012 536.4 $ 3,352 Stock options and other 172         Balance at October31, 2013 536.4 3,524 Stock options and other 151         Balance at October31, 2014 536.4 3,675 Stock options and other 151         Balance at October31, 2015 536.4 $ 3,826                                 The number of common shares the company is authorized to issue is 1,200million. The number of authorized preferred shares, none of which has been issued, is nine million.
The Board of Directors at its meeting in December 2013 authorized the repurchase of up to $8,000million of common stock (102.6million shares based on the October31, 2015 closing common stock price of $78.00 per share). At October31, 2015, this repurchase program had $3,461million (44.4million shares at the same price) remaining to be repurchased. Repurchases of the company's common stock under this plan will be made from time to time, at the company's discretion, in the open market.
A reconciliation of basic and diluted net income per share attributable to Deere& Company follows in millions, except per share amounts:            2015 2014 2013            Net income attributable to Deere&Company $ 1,940.0 $ 3,161.7 $ 3,537.3 Less income allocable to participating securities .8 1.0 .9            Income allocable to common stock $ 1,939.2 $ 3,160.7 $ 3,536.4                                  Average shares outstanding 333.6 363.0 385.3                                  Basic per share $ 5.81 $ 8.71 $ 9.18                                  Average shares outstanding 333.6 363.0 385.3 Effect of dilutive stock options 2.4 3.1 3.9            Total potential shares outstanding 336.0 366.1 389.2                                  Diluted per share $ 5.77 $ 8.63 $ 9.09                                             All stock options outstanding were included in the computation during2015, 2014 and 2013, except 2.4million in 2014 and 2.4million in 2013 that had an antidilutive effect under the treasury stock method.
24. STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS The company issues stock options and restricted stock awards to key employees under plans approved by stockholders. Restricted stock is also issued to nonemployee directors for their services as directors under a plan approved by stockholders. Options are awarded with the exercise price equal to the market price and become exercisable in one to three years after grant. Options expire ten years after the date of grant. Restricted stock awards generally vest after three years. The compensation cost for stock options, service based restricted stock units and market/service based restricted stock units, which is based on the fair value at the grant date, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite period the employee is required to render service. The compensation cost for performance/service based units, which is based on the fair value at the grant date, is recognized over the employees' requisite service period and periodically adjusted for the probable number of shares to be awarded. According to these plans at October31, 2015, the company is authorized to grant an additional 16.9million shares related to stock options or restricted stock.
The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using a binomial lattice option valuation model. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from traded call options on the company's stock. The expected volatilities are constructed from the following three components: the starting implied volatility of short-term call options traded within a few days of the valuation date; the predicted implied volatility of long-term call options; and the trend in implied volatilities over the span of the call options' time to maturity. The company uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior and employee termination within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rates utilized for periods throughout the contractual life of the options are based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of grant.
The assumptions used for the binomial lattice model to determine the fair value of options follow:        2015 2014 2013        Risk-free interest rate .04%2.3% .03%2.9% .04%1.7% Expected dividends 2.5% 2.3% 2.3% Expected volatility 23.4%25.7% 25.9%32.0% 26.6%32.5% Weighted-average volatility 25.6% 31.9% 32.4% Expected term (in years) 7.28.2 7.37.4 7.37.9          56  Stock option activity at October31, 2015 and changes during 2015 in millions of dollars and shares follow:               Shares Exercise Price* Remaining Contractual Term (Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value               Outstanding at beginning ofyear 14.9 $ 71.64 Granted 3.0 88.19 Exercised (2.9 ) 58.65 Expired or forfeited (.2 ) 87.44               Outstanding at end of year 14.8 77.39 6.21 $ 94.5                                           Exercisable at end of year 9.3 72.78 5.19 84.8 *Weighted-averages The weighted-average grant-date fair values of options granted during2015, 2014 and 2013 were $19.67, $24.74 and $23.73, respectively. The total intrinsic values of options exercised during 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $98million, $125million and $183million, respectively. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, cash received from stock option exercises was $172million, $149million and $175million with tax benefits of $36million, $46million and $68million, respectively.
The company granted 248thousand, 236thousand and 254thousand restricted stock units to employees and nonemployee directors in 2015, 2014 and 2013, of which 122thousand, 102thousand and 110thousand are subject to service based only conditions, 63thousand, 67thousand and 72thousand are subject to performance/service based conditions, 63thousand, 67thousand and 72thousand are subject to market/service based conditions, respectively. The service based only units award one share of common stock for each unit at the end of the vesting period and include dividend equivalent payments.
The performance/service based units are subject to a performance metric based on the company's compound annual revenue growth rate, compared to a benchmark group of companies over the vesting period. The market/service based units are subject to a market related metric based on total shareholder return, compared to the same benchmark group of companies over the vesting period. The performance/service based units and the market/service based units both award common stock in a range of zero to 200percent for each unit granted based on the level of the metric achieved and do not include dividend equivalent payments over the vesting period. The weighted-average fair values of the service based only units at the grant dates during2015, 2014 and 2013 were $88.66, $87.16 and $86.88 per unit, respectively, based on the market price of a share of underlying common stock. The fair value of the performance/service based units at the grant date during2015, 2014 and 2013 were $81.78, $81.53 and $80.73 per unit, respectively, based on the market price of a share of underlying common stock excluding dividends. The fair value of the market/service based units at the grant date during 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $113.97, $116.86 and $106.75 per unit, respectively, based on a lattice valuation model excluding dividends.

Fair values of the financing receivables that were issued long-term were based on the discounted values of their related cash flows at interest rates currently being offered by the company for similar financing receivables. The fair values of the remaining financing receivables approximated the carrying amounts.
Fair values of long-term borrowings and short-term securitization borrowings were based on current market quotes for identical or similar borrowings and credit risk, or on the discounted values of their related cash flows at current market interest rates. Certain long-term borrowings have been swapped to current variable interest rates. The carrying values of these long-term borrowings included adjustments related to fair value hedges.

See Note5 for impairments.
Level1 measurements consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level2 measurements include significant other observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets; observable inputs such as interest rates and yield curves; and other market-corroborated inputs. Level3 measurements include significant unobservable inputs.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the company uses various methods including market and income approaches. The company utilizes valuation models and techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs. The models are industry-standard models that consider various assumptions including time values and yield curves as well as other economic measures. These valuation techniques are consistently applied.
The following is a description of the valuation methodologies the company uses to measure certain financial instruments on the balance sheet and nonmonetary assets at fair value: Marketable Securities The portfolio of investments, except for the Level3 measurement international debt securities, is primarily valued on a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, credit risk and prepayment speeds. Funds are primarily valued using the fund's net asset value, based on the fair value of the underlying securities. The Level3 measurement international debt securities are primarily valued using an income approach based on discounted cash flows using yield curves derived from limited, observable market data.
Derivatives The company's derivative financial instruments consist of interest rate swaps and caps, foreign currency futures, forwards and swaps, and cross-currency interest rate swaps. The portfolio is valued based on an income approach (discounted cash flow) using market observable inputs, including swap curves and both forward and spot exchange rates for currencies.
60  Financing Receivables Specific reserve impairments are based on the fair value of the collateral, which is measured using a market approach (appraisal values or realizable values). Inputs include a selection of realizable values (see Note12).
Equipment on Operating Leases-Net The impairments are based on an income approach (discounted cash flow), using the contractual payments, plus an estimate of equipment sale price at lease maturity. Inputs include realized sales values.
Property and Equipment-Net The impairments are measured at the lower of the carrying amount, or fair value. The valuations were based on a cost approach. The inputs include replacement cost estimates adjusted for physical deterioration and economic obsolescence.
Other Intangible Assets-Net The impairments are measured at the lower of the carrying amount, or fair value. The valuations were based on an income approach (discounted cash flows). The inputs include estimates of future cash flows.
Other Assets The impairments are measured at the lower of the carrying amount, or fair value. The valuations were based on a market approach. The inputs include sales of comparable assets.
Assets Held For Sale-Water Operations The impairment of the disposal group was measured at the lower of carrying amount, or fair value less cost to sell. Fair value was based on the probable sale price. The inputs included estimates of the final sale price (see Note5).
27. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS Cash Flow Hedges Certain interest rate and cross-currency interest rate contracts (swaps) were designated as hedges of future cash flows from borrowings. The total notional amounts of the receive-variable/pay-fixed interest rate contracts at October31, 2015 and 2014 were $2,800million and $3,050million, respectively. The total notional amounts of the cross-currency interest rate contracts were $60million and $70million at October31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The effective portions of the fair value gains or losses on these cash flow hedges were recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and subsequently reclassified into interest expense or other operating expenses (foreign exchange) in the same periods during which the hedged transactions affected earnings. These amounts offset the effects of interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate changes on the related borrowings. Any ineffective portions of the gains or losses on all cash flow interest rate contracts designated as cash flow hedges were recognized currently in interest expense or other operating expenses (foreign exchange) and were not material during any years presented. The cash flows from these contracts were recorded in operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows.
The amount of loss recorded in OCI at October31, 2015 that is expected to be reclassified to interest expense or other operating expenses in the next twelve months if interest rates or exchange rates remain unchanged is approximately $4million after-tax. These contracts mature in up to 35months. There were no gains or losses reclassified from OCI to earnings based on the probability that the original forecasted transaction would not occur.
Fair Value Hedges Certain interest rate contracts (swaps) were designated as fair value hedges of borrowings. The total notional amounts of the receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate contracts at October31, 2015 and 2014 were $8,618million and $8,798million, respectively. The effective portions of the fair value gains or losses on these contracts were offset by fair value gains or losses on the hedged items (fixed-rate borrowings). Any ineffective portions of the gains or losses were recognized currently in interest expense. The ineffective portions were a gain of $2million and loss of $2million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The cash flows from these contracts were recorded in operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows.
The gains (losses) on these contracts and the underlying borrowings recorded in interest expense follow in millions of dollars:         2015 2014         Interest rate contracts* $ 104 $ (13 ) Borrowings** (102 ) 11 * Includes changes in fair values of interest rate contracts excluding net accrued interest income of $173million and $168million during 2015 and 2014, respectively.
** Includes adjustments for fair values of hedged borrowings excluding accrued interest expense of $274million and $267million during 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments The company has certain interest rate contracts (swaps and caps), foreign exchange contracts (futures, forwards and swaps) and cross-currency interest rate contracts (swaps), which were not formally designated as hedges. These derivatives were held as economic hedges for underlying interest rate or foreign currency exposures primarily for certain borrowings and purchases or sales of inventory. The total notional amounts of the interest rate swaps at October31, 2015 and 2014 were $6,333million and $6,317million, the foreign exchange contracts were $3,160million and $3,524million and the cross-currency interest rate contracts were $76million and $98million, respectively. At October31, 2015 and 2014, there were also $1,069million and $1,703million, respectively, of interest rate caps purchased and the same amounts sold at the same capped interest rate to facilitate borrowings through securitization of retail notes. The fair value gains or losses from the interest rate contracts were recognized currently in interest expense and the gains or losses from foreign exchange contracts in cost of sales or other operating expenses, generally offsetting over time the expenses on the exposures being hedged. The cash flows from these non-designated contracts were recorded in operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows.

** The amounts are not significant.
Counterparty Risk and Collateral Certain of the company's derivative agreements contain credit support provisions that may require the company to post collateral based on the size of the net liability positions and credit ratings. The aggregate fair value of all derivatives with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position at October31, 2015 and October31, 2014, was $41million and $57million, respectively. The company, due to its credit rating and amounts of net liability position, has not posted any collateral. If the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered, the company would be required to post collateral up to an amount equal to this liability position, prior to considering applicable netting provisions.
Derivative instruments are subject to significant concentrations of credit risk to the banking sector. The company manages individual counterparty exposure by setting limits that consider the credit rating of the counterparty, the credit default swap spread of the counterparty and other financial commitments and exposures between the company and the counterparty banks. All interest rate derivatives are transacted under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) documentation. Some of these agreements include credit support provisions. Each master agreement permits the net settlement of amounts owed in the event of default or termination.
Derivatives are recorded without offsetting for netting arrangements or collateral. The impact on the derivative assets and liabilities related to netting arrangements and any collateral received or paid at October31 in millions of dollars follows:            Gross Amounts Recognized  Netting Arrangements  Collateral Received  Net Amount            2015              Assets   $ 428    $ (62 )      $ 366   Liabilities   78    (62 )      16   2014              Assets   $ 353    $ (76 )   $ (5 )   $ 272   Liabilities   110    (76 )      34             28. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA DATA FOR THE YEARS ENDED OCTOBER31, 2015, 2014 AND 2013 The company's operations are presently organized and reported in three major business segments described as follows: The agriculture and turf segment primarily manufactures and distributes a full line of agriculture and turf equipment and related service partsincluding large, medium and utility tractors; loaders; combines, corn pickers, cotton and sugarcane harvesters and related front-end equipment and sugarcane loaders; tillage, seeding and application equipment, including sprayers, nutrient management and soil preparation machinery; hay and forage equipment, including self-propelled forage harvesters and attachments, balers and mowers; turf and utility equipment, including riding lawn equipment and walk-behind mowers, golf course equipment, utility vehicles, and commercial mowing equipment, along with a broad line of associated implements; integrated agricultural management systems technology and solutions; and other outdoor power products.
The construction and forestry segment primarily manufactures and distributes a broad range of machines and service parts used in construction, earthmoving, material handling and timber harvestingincluding backhoe loaders; crawler dozers and loaders; four-wheel-drive loaders; excavators; motor graders; articulated dump trucks; landscape loaders; skid-steer loaders; and log skidders, feller bunchers, log loaders, log forwarders, log harvesters and related attachments.
62  The products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets.
The financial services segment primarily finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the financial services segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, finances retail revolving charge accounts and offers extended equipment warranties.
Because of integrated manufacturing operations and common administrative and marketing support, a substantial number of allocations must be made to determine operating segment and geographic area data. Intersegment sales and revenues represent sales of components and finance charges, which are generally based on market prices.
Information relating to operations by operating segment in millions of dollars follows. In addition to the following unaffiliated sales and revenues by segment, intersegment sales and revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: agriculture and turf net sales of $49million, $89million and $69million, construction and forestry net sales of $1million, $1million and $2million, and financial services revenues of $225million, $228million and $220million, respectively.

68  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Deere& Company: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Deere& Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of October31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of consolidated income, consolidated comprehensive income, changes in consolidated stockholders equity, and consolidated cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October31, 2014. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index under PartIV,Item 15(2). We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of October31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission .
