1 Index PART I Item 1.
Business.
Our Company We are a leading global provider of data-driven marketing and loyalty solutions serving large, consumer-based businesses in a variety of industries. We offer a comprehensive portfolio of integrated outsourced marketing solutions, including customer loyalty programs, database marketing services, marketing strategy consulting, analytics and creative services, direct marketing services and private label and co-brand retail credit card programs. We focus on facilitating and managing interactions between our clients and their customers through all consumer marketing channels, including in-store, online, catalog, mail, telephone and email, and emerging channels such as mobile and social media. We capture and analyze data created during each customer interaction, leveraging the insight derived from that data to enable clients to identify and acquire new customers and to enhance customer loyalty. We believe that our services are becoming increasingly valuable as businesses shift marketing resources away from traditional mass marketing toward more targeted marketing programs that provide measurable returns on marketing investments.
Our client base of more than 1,300 companies consists primarily of large consumer-based businesses, including well-known brands such as Bank of Montreal, Canada Safeway, Shell Canada, Procter & Gamble, AstraZeneca, Hilton, Bank of America, General Motors, FedEx, Kraft, Victorias Secret, Lane Bryant, Pottery Barn, J. Crew and Ann Taylor. Our client base is diversified across a broad range of end-markets, including financial services, specialty retail, grocery and drugstore chains, petroleum retail, automotive, hospitality and travel, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals. We believe our comprehensive suite of marketing solutions offers us a significant competitive advantage, as many of our competitors offer a more limited range of services. We believe the breadth and quality of our service offerings have enabled us to establish and maintain long-standing client relationships.
Corporate Headquarters.
Our corporate headquarters are located at 7500 Dallas Parkway, Suite 700, Plano, Texas 75024, where our telephone number is 214-494-3000.
Our Market Opportunity and Growth Strategy We intend to continue capitalizing on the shift in traditional advertising and marketing spend to highly targeted marketing programs. We intend to enhance our position as a leading global provider of data-driven marketing and loyalty solutions and to continue our growth in revenue and earnings by pursuing the following strategies:  Capitalize on our Leadership in Highly Targeted and Data-Driven Consumer Marketing.
As consumer-based businesses shift their marketing spend to data-driven marketing strategies, we believe we are well-positioned to acquire new clients and sell additional services to existing clients based on our extensive experience in capturing and analyzing our clients customer transaction data to develop targeted marketing programs. We believe our comprehensive portfolio of high-quality targeted marketing and loyalty solutions provides a competitive advantage over other marketing services firms with more limited service offerings. We seek to extend our leadership position by continuing to improve the breadth and quality of our products and services. We intend to enhance our leadership position in loyalty and marketing solutions by expanding the scope of the Canadian AIR MILES  Reward Program, by continuing to develop stand-alone loyalty programs such as the Hilton HHonors  Program, and by increasing our penetration in the retail sector with our integrated marketing and credit services offering.
Sell More Fully Integrated End-to-End Marketing Solutions.
In our Epsilon  segment, we have assembled what we believe is the industrys most comprehensive suite of targeted and data-driven marketing services, including marketing strategy consulting, data services, database development and management, marketing analytics, creative design and delivery services such as email communications. We offer an end-to-end solution to clients, providing a significant opportunity to expand our relationships with existing clients, the majority of whom do not currently purchase our full suite of services. In addition, we further intend to integrate our product and service offerings so that we can provide clients with a comprehensive portfolio of targeted marketing solutions, including both coalition and individual loyalty programs, private label and co-brand retail credit card programs and other data-driven marketing solutions. By selling integrated solutions across our entire client base, we have a significant opportunity to maximize the value of our long-standing client relationships.
Continue to Expand our Global Footprint.
We plan to grow our business by leveraging our core competencies in the North American marketplace to further penetrate international markets. We currently own approximately 37% of CBSM-Companhia Brasileira De Servicos De Marketing, the operator of the dotz coalition loyalty program in Brazil. In 2013, dotz expanded the number of regions in Brazil in which it operates from five regions with more than six million customers to nine regions with more than 2 Index 10 million customers enrolled in the program. We expect dotz to enter into four additional markets in Brazil during 2014. In addition, on January2, 2014, we acquired a 60% ownership interest in Netherlands-based BrandLoyalty Group B.V., or BrandLoyalty, a data-driven loyalty marketer focused on food retailers. The acquisition expands our presence across Europe and Asia. Global reach is increasingly important as our clients grow into new markets, and we are well positioned to cost-effectively increase our global presence. We believe continued international expansion will provide us with strong revenue growth opportunities.
Optimize our Business Portfolio.
We intend to continue to evaluate our products and services given our strategic direction and demand trends. While we are focused on realizing organic revenue growth and margin expansion, we will consider select acquisitions of complementary businesses that would enhance our product portfolio, market positioning or geographic presence.
Products and Services Our products and services are reported under three segmentsLoyaltyOne  , Epsilon and Private Label Services and Credit, and are listed below. Financial information about our segments and geographic areas appears in Note 18, Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Segment Products and Services LoyaltyOne  AIR MILES Reward Program  Loyalty Services Loyalty consulting Customer analytics Creative services Epsilon  Marketing Services Agency services Database design and management Data services Analytical services Traditional and digital communications Private Label Services and Credit  Receivables Financing Underwriting and risk management Receivables funding  Processing Services New account processing Bill processing Remittance processing Customer care  Marketing Services LoyaltyOne Our LoyaltyOne clients are focused on acquiring and retaining loyal and profitable customers. We use the information gathered through our loyalty programs to help our clients design and implement effective marketing programs. Our clients within this segment include financial services providers, grocery stores, drug stores, petroleum retailers and specialty retailers.
LoyaltyOne owns and operates the AIR MILES Reward Program, which is the premier coalition loyalty program in Canada, with over 170 brand name sponsors participating in the program. The AIR MILES Reward Program enables consumers to earn AIR MILES reward miles as they shop within a range of retailers and other sponsors participating in the AIR MILES Reward Program. These AIR MILES reward miles can be redeemed by our collectors for travel or other rewards.
Approximately two-thirds of Canadian households actively participate in the AIR MILES Reward Program, and it was recently named as one of the 10 most influential brands in Canada in Canadas Ipsos Influence index. The three primary parties involved in our AIR MILES Reward Program are: sponsors, collectors and suppliers, each of which is described below.
Sponsors . More than 170 brand name sponsors participate in our AIR MILES Reward Program, including Canada Safeway, Shell Canada, Jean Coutu, RONA, Amex Bank of Canada, Sobeys and Bank of Montreal.
3 Index The AIR MILES Reward Program is a full service outsourced loyalty program for our sponsors, who pay us a fee per AIR MILES reward mile issued, in return for which we provide all marketing, customer service, rewards and redemption management. We typically grant participating sponsors exclusivity in their market category, enabling them to realize incremental sales and increase market share as a result of their participation in the AIR MILES Reward Program coalition.
Collectors . Collectors earn AIR MILES reward miles at thousands of retail and service locations, typically including any online presence the sponsor may have. Collectors can also earn at the many locations where collectors can use certain cards issued by Bank of Montreal and Amex Bank of Canada. This enables collectors to rapidly accumulate AIR MILES reward miles across a significant portion of their everyday spend. The AIR MILES Reward Program offers a reward structure that provides a quick, easy and free way for collectors to earn a broad selection of travel, entertainment and other lifestyle rewards through their day-to-day shopping at participating sponsors.
Suppliers . We enter into agreements with airlines, movie theaters, manufacturers of consumer electronics and other providers to supply rewards for the AIR MILES Reward Program. The broad range of rewards that can be redeemed is one of the reasons the AIR MILES Reward Program remains popular with collectors. Over 400 suppliers use the AIR MILES Reward Program as an additional distribution channel for their products. Suppliers include well-recognized companies in diverse industries, including travel, hospitality, electronics and entertainment.
In December2011, we introduced a new program option called AIR MILES Cash to which collectors can allocate some or all of their future AIR MILES reward miles collected. Effective March2012, collectors were able to instantly redeem their AIR MILES reward miles collected in AIR MILES Cash towards in-store purchases at participating sponsors. We currently have 10 participating sponsors that can process instant redemptions of AIR MILES reward miles collected in the AIR MILES Cash program option.
On January 2, 2014, we acquired a 60% ownership interest in BrandLoyalty Group B.V., a Netherlands-based, data-driven loyalty marketer. BrandLoyalty designs, organizes, implements and evaluates innovative and tailor-made loyalty programs for food retailers. These loyalty programs are designed to generate immediate changes in consumer behavior and are offered through leading grocers across Europe and Asia. These instant loyalty programs are designed to drive traffic by attracting new customers and motivating existing customers to spend more because the reward is instant, topical and newsworthy. These programs are tailored for the specific client and are designed to reward key customer segments based on their spending levels during short-term campaign periods. Following the completion of each program, BrandLoyalty analyzes spending data to determine the grocers lift in market share and the programs return on investment.
Epsilon Epsilon is a leading marketing services firm providing end-to-end, integrated marketing solutions that leverage transactional data to help clients more effectively acquire and build stronger relationships with their customers. Services include strategic consulting, customer database technologies, permission-based email marketing, loyalty management, proprietary data, predictive modeling and a full range of direct and digital agency services. On behalf of our clients, we develop marketing programs for individual consumers with highly targeted offers and communications. Since these communications are more relevant to the consumer, the consumer is more likely to be responsive to these offers, resulting in a measurable return on our clients marketing investments. We distribute marketing campaigns and communications through all marketing channels based on the consumers preference, including digital platforms such as email, mobile and social media. Epsilon has over 950 clients, operating primarily in the financial services, automotive, travel and hospitality, pharmaceutical and telecommunications end-markets.
Agency Services . Through our consulting services we analyze our clients business, brand and/or product strategy to create customer acquisition and retention strategies and tactics designed to further optimize our clients customer relationships and marketing return on investment. We offer ROI-based targeted marketing services through digital user experience design technology, customer relationship marketing, consumer promotions marketing, direct and digital shopper marketing, distributed and local area marketing, and analytical services that include brand planning and consumer insights.
Database Design and Management . We design, build and operate complex consumer marketing databases for large consumer-facing brands such as Hilton HHonors and the Citi ThankYou  programs. Our solutions are highly customized and support our clients needs for real-time data integration from a multitude of data sources, including multi-channel transactional data.
Data Services . We believe we are one of the leading sources of comprehensive consumer data that is essential to marketers when making informed marketing decisions. Together with our clients, we use this data to develop highly-targeted, individualized marketing programs that increase response rates and build stronger customer relationships.
Analytical Services . We provide behavior-based, demographic and attitudinal customer segmentation, purchase analysis, web analytics, marketing mix modeling, program optimization, predictive modeling and program measurement and analysis. Through our analytical services, we gain a better understanding of consumer behavior that can help our clients as they develop customer relationship strategies.
4 Index Traditional and Digital Communications . We provide strategic communication solutions and our end-to-end suite of products and services includes strategic consulting, creative services, campaign management and delivery optimization. We deploy marketing campaigns and communications through all marketing channels, including digital platforms such as email, mobile and social media. We also operate what we believe to be one of the largest global permission-based email marketing platforms in the industry.
Private Label Services and Credit Our Private Label Services and Credit segment assists some of the best known retailers in extending their brand with a private label and/or co-brand credit card account that can be used by their customers in the store, or through online or catalog purchases.
Receivables Financing . Our Private Label Services and Credit segment provides risk management solutions, account origination and funding services for our more than 120 private label and co-brand credit card programs. Through these credit card programs, we had $8.2 billion in principal receivables, from over 33.5 million active accounts for the year ended December31, 2013, with an average balance during that period of approximately $464 for accounts with outstanding balances. As of December31, 2013, L Brands and its retail affiliates and Ascena Retail Group, Inc. and its retail affiliates accounted for approximately 13.0% and 10.6%, respectively, of our credit card and loan receivables. We process millions of credit card applications each year using automated proprietary scoring technology and verification procedures to make risk-based origination decisions when approving new credit card accountholders and establishing their credit card limits. We augment these procedures with credit risk scores provided by credit bureaus. This information helps us segment prospects into narrower risk ranges, allowing us to better evaluate individual credit risk.
Our accountholder base consists primarily of middle- to upper-income individuals, in particular women who use our credit cards primarily as brand affinity tools. These accounts generally have lower average balances compared to balances on general purpose credit cards. We focus our sales efforts on prime borrowers and do not target sub-prime borrowers.
We use a securitization program as our primary funding vehicle for our credit card receivables. Securitizations involve the packaging and selling of both current and future receivable balances of credit card accounts to a master trust, which is a variable interest entity, or VIE. Our three master trusts are consolidated in our financial statements.
Processing Services . We perform processing services and provide service and maintenance for private label and co-brand credit card programs. We use automated technology for bill preparation, printing and mailing, and also offer consumers the ability to view, print and pay their bills online. By doing so, we improve the funds availability for both our clients and for those private label and co-brand credit card receivables that we own or securitize. Our customer care operations are influenced by our retail heritage and we view every customer touch point as an opportunity to generate or reinforce a sale. We provide focused training programs in all areas to achieve the highest possible customer service standards and monitor our performance by conducting surveys with our clients and their customers. For the ninth consecutive time, we have been certified as a Center of Excellence for the quality of our operations, the most prestigious ranking attainable, by Benchmark Portal. Founded by Purdue University in 1995, Benchmark Portal is a global leader of best practices for call centers. Our call centers are equipped to handle phone, mail, fax, email and web inquiries. We also provide collection activities on delinquent accounts to support our private label and co-brand credit card programs.
Marketing Services . Our private label and co-branded credit card programs are designed specifically for retailers and have the flexibility to be customized to accommodate our clients specific needs. Through our integrated marketing services, we design and implement strategies that assist our clients in acquiring, retaining and managing valuable repeat customers. Our credit card programs capture transaction data that we analyze to better understand consumer behavior and use to increase the effectiveness of our clients marketing activities. We use multi-channel marketing communication tools, including in-store, permission-based email, mobile messaging and direct mail to reach our clients customers.
Disaster and Contingency Planning We operate, either internally or through third-party service providers, multiple data processing centers to process and store our customer transaction data. Given the significant amount of data that we or our third-party service providers manage, much of which is real-time data to support our clients commerce initiatives, we have established redundant capabilities for our data centers. We have a number of safeguards in place that are designed to protect us from data-related risks and in the event of a disaster, to restore our data centers systems.
5 Index Protection of Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights We rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other similar measures to protect our proprietary information and technology used in each segment of our business. We currently have one patent application pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate partners, and generally control access to and distribution of our technology, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite the efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain the use of our products or technology that we consider proprietary and third parties may attempt to develop similar technology independently. We pursue registration and protection of our trademarks primarily in the United States and Canada, although we also have either registered trademarks or applications pending for certain marks in Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, the European Union or some of its individual countries (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom), Peru, Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil, China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, Norway, Russian Federation, Turkey, Vietnam and Singapore and internationally under the Madrid Protocol in several countries, including several of the aforementioned countries. We are the exclusive Canadian licensee of the AIR MILES family of trademarks pursuant to a perpetual license agreement with Air Miles International Trading B.V., for which we pay a royalty fee. We believe that the AIR MILES family of trademarks and our other trademarks are important for our branding, corporate identification and marketing of our services in each business segment.
Competition The markets for our products and services are highly competitive. We compete with marketing services companies, credit card issuers, and data processing companies, as well as with the in-house staffs of our current and potential clients.
LoyaltyOne.
As a provider of marketing services, our LoyaltyOne segment generally competes with advertising and other promotional and loyalty programs, both traditional and online, for a portion of a clients total marketing budget. In addition, we compete against internally developed products and services created by our existing and potential clients. We expect competition to intensify as more competitors enter our market. Competitors with our AIR MILES Reward Program may target our sponsors and collectors as well as draw rewards from our rewards suppliers. Our ability to generate significant revenue from clients and loyalty partners will depend on our ability to differentiate ourselves through the products and services we provide and the attractiveness of our loyalty and rewards programs to consumers. The continued attractiveness of our loyalty and rewards programs will also depend on our ability to remain affiliated with sponsors that are desirable to consumers and to offer rewards that are both attainable and attractive to consumers.
Epsilon.
Our Epsilon segment generally competes with a variety of niche providers as well as large media/digital agencies. For the niche provider competitors, their focus has primarily been on one or two services within the marketing value chain, rather than the full spectrum of data-driven marketing services used for both traditional and online advertising and promotional marketing programs. For the larger media/digital agencies, most offer the breadth of services but typically do not have the internal integration of offerings to deliver a seamless one stop shop solution, from strategy to execution across traditional as well as digital and emerging technologies. In addition, Epsilon competes against internally developed products and services created by our existing clients and others. We expect competition to intensify as more competitors enter our market. For our targeted direct marketing services offerings, our ability to continue to capture detailed customer transaction data is critical in providing effective marketing and loyalty strategies for our clients. Our ability to differentiate the mix of products and services that we offer, together with the effective delivery of those products and services, are also important factors in meeting our clients objective to continually improve their return on marketing investment.
Private Label Services and Credit.
Our Private Label Services and Credit segment competes primarily with financial institutions whose marketing focus has been on developing credit card programs with large revolving balances. These competitors further drive their businesses by cross-selling their other financial products to their cardholders. Our focus has primarily been on targeting specialty retailers that understand the competitive advantage of developing loyal customers. Typically, these retailers seek customers that make more frequent but smaller transactions at their retail locations. As a result, we are able to analyze card-based transaction data we obtain through managing our credit card programs, including customer specific transaction data and overall consumer spending patterns, to develop and implement successful marketing strategies for our clients. As an issuer of private label retail credit cards and co-branded Visa  , MasterCard  and Discover  credit cards, we also compete with general purpose credit cards issued by other financial institutions, as well as cash, checks and debit cards.
6 Index Regulation Federal and state laws and regulations extensively regulate the operations of Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank, our bank subsidiaries. Many of these laws and regulations are intended to maintain the safety and soundness of Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank, and they impose significant restraints on those companies to which other non-regulated companies are not subject. Because Comenity Bank is deemed a credit card bank and Comenity Capital Bank is an industrial bank within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, we are not subject to regulation as a bank holding company. If we were subject to regulation as a bank holding company, we would be constrained in our operations to a limited number of activities that are closely related to banking or financial services in nature. Nevertheless, as a state bank, Comenity Bank is still subject to overlapping supervision by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, and the State of Delaware; and, as an industrial bank, Comenity Capital Bank is still subject to overlapping supervision by the FDIC and the State of Utah.
The Dodd-Frank Act contains certain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity or nonbanking financial company supervised by the Federal Reserve (covered organizations) to engage in proprietary trading or to make investments in, or have certain relationships with, hedge funds and private equity funds (commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule). In December 2013, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, adopted final regulations implementing those provisions. Covered organizations have until July 21, 2015 to comply fully with most requirements of the Volcker Rule. We are still assessing the impact of the Volcker Rule on our business practices, but do not expect it to have a material impact on our credit card securitization program.
Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank must maintain minimum amounts of regulatory capital, including maintenance of certain capital ratios, paid-in capital minimums, and an appropriate allowance for loan loss, as well as meeting specific guidelines that involve measures and ratios of their assets, liabilities, regulatory capital and interest rate, among other factors. If Comenity Bank or Comenity Capital Bank does not meet these capital requirements, their respective regulators have broad discretion to institute a number of corrective actions that could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. To pay any dividend, Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank must maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines.
We are limited under Sections23A and23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board RegulationW in the extent to which we can borrow or otherwise obtain credit from or engage in other covered transactions with Comenity Bank or Comenity Capital Bank, which may have the effect of limiting the extent to which Comenity Bank or Comenity Capital Bank can finance or otherwise supply funds to us. Covered transactions include loans or extensions of credit, purchases of or investments in securities, purchases of assets, including assets subject to an agreement to repurchase, acceptance of securities as collateral for a loan or extension of credit, or the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance, or letter of credit. Although the applicable rules do not serve as an outright bar on engaging in covered transactions, they do require that we engage in covered transactions with Comenity Bank or Comenity Capital Bank only on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to Comenity Bank or Comenity Capital Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. Furthermore, with certain exceptions, each loan or extension of credit by Comenity Bank or Comenity Capital Bank to us or our other affiliates must be secured by collateral with a market value ranging from 100% to 130% of the amount of the loan or extension of credit, depending on the type of collateral.
We are required to monitor and report unusual or suspicious account activity as well as transactions involving amounts in excess of prescribed limits under the Bank Secrecy Act, Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, rules, and other regulations. Congress, the IRS and the bank regulators have focused their attention on banks monitoring and reporting of suspicious activities. Additionally, Congress and the bank regulators have proposed, adopted or passed a number of new laws and regulations that may increase reporting obligations of banks. We are also subject to numerous laws and regulations that are intended to protect consumers, including state laws, the Truth in Lending Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009. These laws and regulations mandate various disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which we may interact with consumers. These and other laws also limit finance charges or other fees or charges earned in our activities. We conduct our operations in a manner that we believe excludes us from regulation as a consumer reporting agency under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. If we were deemed a consumer reporting agency, however, we would be subject to a number of additional complex regulatory requirements and restrictions.
A number of privacy laws and regulations have been enacted in the United States, Canada, the European Union, China and other international markets in which we operate. These laws and regulations place many restrictions on our ability to collect and disseminate customer information. In addition, the enactment of new or amended legislation around the world could place additional restrictions on our ability to utilize customer information. For example, Canada has enacted privacy legislation known as the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. Among its principles, this act requires organizations to obtain a consumers consent to collect, use or disclose personal information. Under this act, which took effect on January1, 2001, the nature of the required consent depends on the sensitivity of the personal information, and the act permits personal information to be used only for the purposes for which it was collected. Some Canadian provinces have enacted substantially similar privacy legislation. We believe we have taken appropriate steps with our AIR MILES Reward Program to comply with these laws.
7 Index In the United States and under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, we are required to maintain a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards relating to customer information. It also requires us to provide initial and annual privacy notices to customers that describe in general terms our information sharing practices. If we intend to share nonpublic personal information about customers with affiliates and/or nonaffiliated third parties, we must provide our customers with a notice and a reasonable period of time for each customer to opt out of any such disclosure. In Canada, the Act to promote the efficiency and adaptability of the Canadian economy by regulating certain activities that discourage reliance on electronic means of carrying out commercial activities, and to amend the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Act, the Competition Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and the Telecommunications Act, more generally known as Canadas Anti-Spam Legislation, may restrict our ability to send commercial electronic messages, defined to include text, sound, voice and image messages to email, or similar accounts, where the primary purpose is advertising or promoting a commercial product or service to our customers and prospective customers. The Act, when in force, will require that a sender have consent to send a commercial electronic message, and provide the customers with an opportunity to opt out from receiving future commercial electronic email messages from the sender.
In addition to U.S. federal privacy laws with which we must comply, states also have adopted statutes, regulations or other measures governing the collection and distribution of nonpublic personal information about customers. In some cases these state measures are preempted by federal law, but if not, we monitor and seek to comply with individual state privacy laws in the conduct of our business.
We also have systems and processes to comply with the USA PATRIOT ACT of 2001, which is designed to deter and punish terrorist acts in the United States and around the world, to enhance law enforcement investigatory tools, and for other purposes.
Employees As of December31, 2013, we had approximately 12,000 employees. We believe our relations with our employees are good. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees.

Risk Factors.
RISK FACTORS Strategic Business Risk and Competitive Environment Our 10 largest clients represented 42.5% of our consolidated revenue in 2013 and the loss of any of these clients could cause a significant drop in our revenue.
We depend on a limited number of large clients for a significant portion of our consolidated revenue. Our 10 largest clients represented approximately 42.5% of our consolidated revenue during the year ended December31, 2013, with no single client representing greater than 10.0% of our consolidated revenue. A decrease in revenue from any of our significant clients for any reason, including a decrease in pricing or activity, or a decision either to utilize another service provider or to no longer outsource some or all of the services we provide, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated revenue.
LoyaltyOne.
LoyaltyOne represents 21.3% of our consolidated revenue. Our 10 largest clients in this segment represented approximately 82.2% of our LoyaltyOne revenue in 2013. Bank of Montreal and Canada Safeway represented approximately 42.2% and 12.1%, respectively, of this segments revenue for 2013. Our contract with Bank of Montreal expires in 2017 and our contract with Canada Safeway expires in 2015, each subject to automatic renewals at five-year intervals. In November 2013, Canada Safeway was acquired by Sobeys, which is also a sponsor in the AIR MILES Reward Program.
Epsilon . Epsilon represents 32.0% of our consolidated revenue. Our 10 largest clients in this segment represented approximately 33.1% of our Epsilon revenue in 2013, with no single client representing more than 10% of Epsilons revenue.
Private Label Services and Credit.
Private Label Services and Credit represents 47.1% of our consolidated revenue. Our 10 largest clients in this segment represented approximately 69.0% of our Private Label Services and Credit revenue in 2013. L Brands and its retail affiliates and Ascena Retail Group, Inc. and its retail affiliates represented approximately 17.2% and 14.4%, respectively, of our revenue for this segment in 2013. Our primary contract with a retail affiliate of L Brands expires in 2018 and our contracts with Ascena Retail Group and its retail affiliates expire in 2016 and 2019.
If actual redemptions by AIR MILES Reward Program collectors are greater than expected, or if the costs related to redemption of AIR MILES reward miles increase, our profitability could be adversely affected.
A portion of our revenue is based on our estimate of the number of AIR MILES reward miles that will go unused by the collector base. The percentage of AIR MILES reward miles not expected to be redeemed is known as breakage.
Breakage is based on managements estimate after viewing and analyzing various historical trends including vintage analysis, current run rates and other pertinent factors, such as the impact of macroeconomic factors and changes in the program structure. If actual redemptions are greater than our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected due to the cost of the excess redemptions. Any significant change in, or failure by management to reasonably estimate, breakage could adversely affect our profitability.
From June 2008 through December 2012, our estimate of breakage was 28%.Based on the analysis of historical redemption trends, statistical analysis performed, and the expected impact of recent changes in the program structure, at December31, 2012 we determined that our estimate of breakage should be lowered to 27%. At December31, 2013 we determined that our estimate of breakage should be further reduced to 26%.
Our AIR MILES Reward Program also exposes us to risks arising from potentially increasing reward costs. Our profitability could be adversely affected if costs related to redemption of AIR MILES reward miles increase. A 10% increase in the cost of redemptions would have resulted in a decrease in pre-tax income of $41.8 million for the year ended December31, 2013.
The loss of our most active AIR MILES Reward Program collectors could adversely affect our growth and profitability.
Our most active AIR MILES Reward Program collectors drive a disproportionately large percentage of our AIR MILES Reward Program revenue. The loss of a significant portion of these collectors, for any reason, could impact our ability to generate significant revenue from sponsors. The continued attractiveness of our loyalty and rewards programs will depend in large part on our ability to remain affiliated with sponsors that are desirable to consumers and to offer rewards that are both attainable and attractive.
9 Index Airline or travel industry disruptions, such as an airline insolvency, could negatively affect the AIR MILES Reward Program, our revenues and profitability.
Air travel is one of the appeals of the AIR MILES Reward Program to collectors. As a result of airline insolvencies and restructurings, we may experience service disruptions that prevent us from fulfilling collectors flight redemption requests. If one of our existing airline suppliers sharply reduces its fleet capacity and route network, we may not be able to satisfy our collectors demands for airline tickets. Tickets from other airlines, if available, could be more expensive than a comparable ticket under our current supply agreements with existing suppliers, and the routes offered by the other airlines may be inadequate, inconvenient or undesirable to the redeeming collectors. As a result, we may experience higher air travel redemption costs, and collector satisfaction with the AIR MILES Reward Program might be adversely affected.
As a result of airline or travel industry disruptions, political instability, terrorist acts or war, some collectors could determine that air travel is too dangerous or burdensome. Consequently, collectors might forego redeeming AIR MILES reward miles for air travel and therefore might not participate in the AIR MILES Reward Program to the extent they previously did, which could adversely affect our revenue from the program.
If we fail to identify suitable acquisition candidates or new business opportunities, or to integrate the businesses we acquire, it could negatively affect our business.
Historically, we have engaged in a significant number of acquisitions, and those acquisitions have contributed to our growth in revenue and profitability. We believe that acquisitions and the identification and pursuit of new business opportunities will be a key component of our continued growth strategy. However, we may not be able to locate and secure future acquisition candidates or to identify and implement new business opportunities on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or successful new business opportunities, our growth could be impaired.
In addition, there are numerous risks associated with acquisitions and the implementation of new businesses, including, but not limited to:  the difficulty and expense that we incur in connection with the acquisition or new business opportunity;  the potential for adverse consequences when conforming the acquired companys accounting policies to ours;  the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns;  the potential loss of customers or key employees of the acquired company;  the impact on our financial condition due to the timing of the acquisition or new business implementation or the failure of the acquired or new business to meet operating expectations; and  the assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired company.
Furthermore, acquisitions that we make may not be successfully integrated into our ongoing operations and we may not achieve expected cost savings or other synergies from an acquisition. If the operations of an acquired or new business do not meet expectations, our profitability and cash flows may be impaired and we may be required to restructure the acquired business or write-off the value of some or all of the assets of the acquired or new business.
We expect growth in our Private Label Services and Credit segment to result from new and acquired credit card programs whose credit card receivables performance could result in increased portfolio losses and negatively impact our earnings.
We expect an important source of growth in our credit card operations to come from the acquisition of existing credit card programs and initiating credit card programs with retailers and others who do not currently offer a private label or co-branded credit card. Although we believe our pricing and models for determining credit risk are designed to evaluate the credit risk of existing programs and the credit risk we are willing to assume for acquired and start-up programs, we cannot be assured that the loss experience on acquired and start-up programs will be consistent with our more established programs. The failure to successfully underwrite these credit card programs may result in defaults greater than our expectations and could have a material adverse impact on us and our earnings.
10 Index Increases in net charge-offs beyond our current estimates could have a negative impact on our net income and profitability.
The primary risk associated with unsecured consumer lending is the risk of default or bankruptcy of the borrower, resulting in the borrowers balance being charged-off as uncollectible. We rely principally on the customers creditworthiness for repayment of the loan and therefore have no other recourse for collection. We may not be able to successfully identify and evaluate the creditworthiness of cardholders to minimize delinquencies and losses. An increase in defaults or net charge-offs could result in a reduction in net income. General economic factors, such as the rate of inflation, unemployment levels and interest rates, may result in greater delinquencies that lead to greater credit losses. In addition to being affected by general economic conditions and the success of our collection and recovery efforts, the stability of our delinquency and net credit card and loan receivable charge-off rates are affected by the credit risk of our credit card and loan receivables and the average age or maturity of our various credit card account portfolios. Further, our pricing strategy may not offset the negative impact on profitability caused by increases in delinquencies and losses, thus any material increases in delinquencies and losses beyond our current estimates could have a material adverse impact on us. For 2013, our average credit card and loan receivable net charge-off rate was 4.7%, compared to 4.8% and 6.9% for 2012 and 2011, respectively.
The markets for the services that we offer may contract or fail to expand which could negatively impact our growth and profitability.
Our growth and continued profitability depend on acceptance of the services that we offer. Our clients may not continue to use the loyalty and targeted marketing strategies and programs that we offer. Changes in technology may enable merchants and retail companies to directly process transactions in a cost-efficient manner without the use of our services. Additionally, downturns in the economy or the performance of retailers may result in a decrease in the demand for our marketing strategies. Further, if customers make fewer purchases of our Private Label Services and Credit customers products and services, we will have fewer transactions to process, resulting in lower revenue. Any decrease in the demand for our services for the reasons discussed above or any other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our growth, revenue and operating results.
Competition in our industries is intense and we expect it to intensify.
The markets for our products and services are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in each of those markets. Some of our current competitors have longer operating histories, stronger brand names and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. Certain of our segments also compete against in-house staffs of our current clients and others or internally developed products and services by our current clients and others. Our ability to generate significant revenue from clients and partners will depend on our ability to differentiate ourselves through the products and services we provide and the attractiveness of our programs to consumers. We may not be able to continue to compete successfully against our current and potential competitors.
Liquidity, Market and Credit Risk The exercise of the convertible note warrants may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
We issued $345.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2014, which we have elected to repay solely in cash as converted through the maturity date in May 2014. Separately but also concurrently with this issuance, we sold warrants to acquire, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, up to approximately 7.3 million shares of our common stock exercisable from August13, 2014 to December4, 2014. The exercise of some or all of the convertible note warrants may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of any of our common stock issuable upon exercise of the convertible note warrants could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.
Interest rate increases on our variable rate debt could materially adversely affect our earnings.
Interest rate risk affects us directly in our borrowing activities. Our borrowing costs were approximately $305.5 million for the year ended December31, 2013. To manage our risk from market interest rates, we actively monitor the interest rates and the interest sensitive components to minimize the impact that changes in interest rates have on the fair value of assets, net income and cash flow. To achieve this objective, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates through the use of fixed-rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements. In 2013, a 1.0% increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease to fiscal year pre-tax income of approximately $23.9 million. Conversely, a corresponding decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a comparable increase to pre-tax income. In addition, we may enter into derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to mitigate our interest rate risk on related financial instruments or to lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt. We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for trading or other speculative purposes.
11 Index If we are unable to securitize our credit card receivables due to changes in the market, we may not be able to fund new credit card receivables, which would have a negative impact on our operations and earnings.
A number of factors affect our ability to fund our receivables in the securitization market, some of which are beyond our control, including:  conditions in the securities markets in general and the asset-backed securitization market in particular;  conformity in the quality of our private label credit card receivables to rating agency requirements and changes in that quality or those requirements; and  ability to fund required overcollateralizations or credit enhancements, which are routinely utilized in order to achieve better credit ratings to lower borrowing cost.
In addition, on April7, 2010, the SEC proposed revised rules for asset-backed securities offerings that, if adopted, would substantially change the disclosure, reporting and offering process for public and private offerings of asset-backed securities, including those offered under our credit card securitization program. On July26, 2011, the SEC re-proposed certain rules relating to the registrant and transaction requirements for the shelf registration of asset-backed securities. If the revised rules for asset-backed securities are adopted in their current form, issuers of publicly offered asset-backed securities would be required to disclose more information regarding the underlying assets. In addition, the proposals would alter the safe-harbor standards for the private placement of asset-backed securities to impose informational requirements similar to those that would apply to registered public offerings of such securities. The SEC also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking relating to the exemptions that our credit card securitization trusts rely on in our credit card securitization programs to avoid registration as investment companies. The form that these rules may ultimately take is uncertain at this time, but such rules may impact our ability or desire to issue asset-backed securities in the future.
On March 30, 2011, the SEC, the FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and certain other banking regulators proposed regulations that would mandate a five percent risk retention requirement for securitizations, and such regulators issued a re-proposal of the risk retention regulations on August 28, 2013. We cannot predict at this time whether our existing credit card securitization programs will satisfy the new regulatory requirements or whether structural changes to those programs will be necessary. Such risk retention requirements may impact our ability or desire to issue asset-backed securities in the future.
Early amortization events may occur as a result of certain adverse events specified for each asset-backed securitization transaction, including, among others, deteriorating asset performance or material servicing defaults. In addition, certain series of funding notes issued by our securitization trusts are subject to early amortization based on triggers relating to the bankruptcy of retailers.Deteriorating economic conditions, particularly in the retail sector, may lead to an increase in bankruptcies among retailers who have entered into private label programs with us, which may in turn cause an early amortization for such funding notes.The occurrence of an early amortization event may significantly limit our ability to securitize additional receivables.
As a result of Basel III, which refers generally to a set of regulatory reforms adopted in the U.S. and internationally that are meant to address issues that arose in the banking sector during the recent financial crisis, banks are becoming subject to more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements.In response to Basel III, noteholders of our securitization trusts funding notes have sought and obtained amendments to their respective transaction documents permitting them to delay disbursement of funding increases by up to 35 days.Although funding may be requested from other noteholders who have not delayed their funding, access to financing could be disrupted if all of the noteholders implement such delays or if the lending capacities of those who did not do so were insufficient to make up the shortfall.In addition, excess spread may be affected if the issuing entitys borrowing costs increase as a result of Basel III.Such cost increases may result, for example, because the noteholders are entitled to indemnification for increased costs resulting from such regulatory changes.
The inability to securitize card receivables due to changes in the market, regulatory proposals, the unavailability of credit enhancements, or any other circumstance or event would have a material adverse effect on our operations and earnings.
A failure by a counterparty to deliver shares or pay amounts due to us upon completion of a transaction, due to bankruptcy or otherwise, may result in an increase in dilution with respect to our common stock or a decline in our earnings per share.
A failure by a forward counterparty, due to bankruptcy or otherwise, to deliver shares of our common stock at settlement or upon acceleration of its respective prepaid forward transaction could result in the recording of those shares as issued and outstanding for purposes of computing and reporting our basic and diluted weighted average shares and earnings per share. This may lead to a decline in our earnings per share without our receiving a return of the purchase price for those shares that we paid to the relevant forward counterparty at the time we entered into the prepaid forward transaction.
A failure by a hedge counterparty, due to bankruptcy or otherwise, to pay to us amounts owed under the note hedge transactions entered into separately but concurrently with the sale of our convertible senior notes will not reduce the consideration we are required t o deliver to a holder upon conversion of its convertible senior notes, which may result in an increase in dilution with respect to our common stock if we issue shares and lead to a decline in our earnings per share, or decrease our available liquidity if we pay cash.
12 Index Our level of indebtedness could materially adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient cash to repay our outstanding debt, our ability to react to changes in our business and our ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund future needs.
We have a high level of indebtedness, which requires a high level of interest and principal payments. Subject to the limits contained in our credit agreement, the indenture governing our convertible senior notes, the indentures governing our senior notes and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our level of indebtedness could intensify. Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. Our higher level of indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could:  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations under any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under our credit agreement, the indenture governing our convertible senior notes, the indentures governing our senior notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness;  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other purposes;  increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage;  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;  limit our ability to borrow additional funds, or to dispose of assets to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate purposes;  reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures;  cause any refinancing of our indebtedness to be at higher interest rates and require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations; and  prevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase all notes tendered to us upon the occurrence of certain changes of control, which would constitute a default under the indenture governing the convertible senior notes.
We do not intend to pay cash dividends.
We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements and other factors that our board deems relevant.
Our reported financial information will be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and certain foreign currencies.
We are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollars through our significant Canadian operations. In 2014, with the acquisition of BrandLoyalty Group B.V, we will also be exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Euro. We currently do not hedge any of our net investment exposure in our Canadian or European operations. For the year ended December 31, 2013, a 10% increase in the strength of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar would have resulted in an increase in pre-tax income of $23.9 million. Conversely, a corresponding decrease in the strength of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar would result in a comparable decrease to pre-tax income in these periods.
Regulatory Environment Legislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business, results of operation and financial condition.
On July21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted into law. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, includes a sweeping reform of the regulation and supervision of financial institutions, as well as of the regulation of derivatives and capital market activities.
13 Index The full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act is difficult to assess because many provisions require federal agencies to adopt implementing regulations. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act mandates multiple studies, which could result in future legislativeor regulatory action. In particular, the Government Accountability Office issued its study on whether it is necessary, in order to strengthen the safety and soundness of institutions or the stability of the financial system of the United States, to eliminate the exemptions to the definition of bank under the Bank Holding Company Act for certain institutions including limited purpose credit card banks and industrial loan companies.
The study did not recommend the elimination of these exemptions. However, if legislation were enacted to eliminate these exemptions without any grandfathering or accommodations for existing institutions, we could be required to become a bank holding company and cease certain of our activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies or divest our credit card bank subsidiary, Comenity Bank, or our industrial bank subsidiary, Comenity Capital Bank.
The Dodd-Frank Act created a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, a new federal consumer protection regulator with authority to make further changes to the federal consumer protection laws and regulations. It is unclear what changes will be promulgated by the CFPB and what effect, if any, such changes would have on our business and operations. The CFPB assumed rulemaking authority under the existing federal consumer financial protection laws, and will enforce those laws against and examine certain non-depository institutions and insured depository institutions with total assets greater than $10billion and their affiliates.
While the CFPB does not examine Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank, it will receive information from their primary federal regulator. In addition, the CFPBs broad rulemaking authority is expected to impact their operations. For example, the CFPBs rulemaking authority may allow it to change regulations adopted in the past by other regulators including regulations issued under the Truth in Lending Act or the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, or the CARD Act, by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The CFPBs ability to rescind, modify or interpret past regulatory guidance could increase our compliance costs and litigation exposure. Furthermore, the CFPB has broad authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices and has taken enforcement action against other credit card issuers and financial services companies. If the CFPB were to exercise its rulemaking authority or take additional enforcement actions, it could result in requirements to alter our products that would make our products less attractive to consumers and impair our ability to offer them profitably.
The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes certain state officials to enforce regulations issued by the CFPB and to enforce the Dodd-Frank Acts general prohibition against unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. To the extent that states enact requirements that differ from federal standards or courts adopt interpretations of federal consumer laws that differ from those adopted by the federal banking agencies, we may be required to alter products or services offered in some jurisdictions or cease offering products, which will increase compliance costs and reduce our ability to offer the same products and services to consumers nationwide.
The effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business and operations could be significant, depending upon final implementing regulations, the actions of our competitors and the behavior of other marketplace participants. In addition, we may be required to invest significant management time and resources to address the various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the numerous regulations that are required to be issued under it. The Dodd-Frank Act and any related legislation or regulations may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Legislation relating to consumer privacy may affect our ability to collect data that we use in providing our loyalty and marketing services, which, among other things, could negatively affect our ability to satisfy our clients needs.
The enactment of new or amended legislation or industry regulations pertaining to consumer or private sector privacy issues could have a material adverse impact on our marketing services. Legislation or industry regulations regarding consumer or private sector privacy issues could place restrictions upon the collection, sharing and use of information that is currently legally available, which could materially increase our cost of collecting some data. These types of legislation or industry regulations could also prohibit us from collecting or disseminating certain types of data, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our clients requirements and our profitability and cash flow targets. While 46 states and the District of Columbia have enacted data breach notification laws, there is no such federal law generally applicable to our businesses. Data breach notification legislation has been proposed widely in the United States and Europe. If enacted, these legislative measures could impose strict requirements on reporting time frames for providing notice, as well as the contents of such notices. In addition to the United States, Canadian and European Union regulations discussed below, we have expanded our marketing services through the acquisition of companies formed and operating in foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional or more stringent legislation and regulations regarding consumer or private sector privacy.
In the United States, federal and state laws such as the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, make it more difficult to collect, share and use information that has previously been legally available and may increase our costs of collecting some data. Regulations under these acts give cardholders the ability to opt out of having information generated by their credit card purchases shared with other affiliated and unaffiliated parties or the public. Our ability to gather, share and utilize this data will be adversely affected if a significant percentage of the consumers whose purchasing behavior we track elect to opt out, thereby precluding us and our affiliates from using their data.
14 Index In the United States, the federal Do-Not-Call Implementation Act makes it more difficult to telephonically communicate with prospective and existing customers. Similar measures were implemented in Canada beginning September1, 2008. Regulations in both the United States and Canada give consumers the ability to opt out, through a national do-not-call registry and state do-not-call registries of having telephone solicitations placed to them by companies that do not have an existing business relationship with the consumer. In addition, regulations require companies to maintain an internal do-not-call list for those who do not want the companies to solicit them through telemarketing. These regulations could limit our ability to provide services and information to our clients. Failure to comply with these regulations could have a negative impact on our reputation and subject us to significant penalties.
In the United States, the federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 restricts our ability to send commercial electronic mail messages, the primary purpose of which is advertising or promoting a commercial product or service, to our customers and prospective customers. The act requires that a commercial electronic mail message provide the customers with an opportunity to opt-out from receiving future commercial electronic mail messages from the sender. Failure to comply with the terms of this act could have a negative impact on our reputation and subject us to significant penalties.
In Canada, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act requires an organization to obtain a consumers consent to collect, use or disclose personal information. Under this act, consumer personal information may be used only for the purposes for which it was collected. We allow our customers to voluntarily opt out from receiving either one or both promotional and marketing mail or promotional and marketing electronic mail. Heightened consumer awareness of, and concern about, privacy may result in customers opting out at higher rates than they have historically. This would mean that a reduced number of customers would receive bonus and promotional offers and therefore those customers may collect fewer AIR MILES reward miles.
Canadas Anti-Spam Legislation may restrict our ability to send commercial electronic messages, defined to include text, sound, voice and image messages to email, or similar accounts, where the primary purpose is advertising or promoting a commercial product or service to our customers and prospective customers. The Act, when in force, will require that a sender have consent to send a commercial electronic message, and provide the customers with an opportunity to opt out from receiving future commercial electronic email messages from the sender. Failure to comply with the terms of this Act or any proposed regulations that may be adopted in the future could have a negative impact on our reputation and subject us to significant monetary penalties.
In the European Union, the Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 requires member states to implement and enforce a comprehensive data protection law that is based on principles designed to safeguard personal data, defined as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. The Directive frames certain requirements for transfer outside of the European Economic Area and individual rights such as consent requirements.The Directive may be superseded by the General Data Protection Regulation which would create more consistency among the European Union member states but could limit our ability to provide services and information to our clients. There is also rapid development of new privacy laws and regulations in the Asia Pacific region, including amendment of existing data protection laws to increase penalties for noncompliance. Failure to comply with these international data protection laws and regulations could have a negative impact on our reputation and subject us to significant penalties.
Current and proposed regulation and legislation relating to our retail credit card services could limit our business activities, product offerings and fees charged.
Various federal and state laws and regulations significantly limit the retail credit card services activities in which we are permitted to engage. Such laws and regulations, among other things, limit the fees and other charges that we can impose on consumers, limit or proscribe certain other terms of our products and services, require specified disclosures to consumers, or require that we maintain certain licenses, qualifications and minimum capital levels. In some cases, the precise application of these statutes and regulations is not clear. In addition, numerous legislative and regulatory proposals are advanced each year which, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability or further restrict the manner in which we conduct our activities. The CARD Act, which was enacted in May2009 and together with its implementing rules, became effective in 2010, acts to limit or modify certain credit card practices and require increased disclosures to consumers. The credit card practices addressed by the rules include, but are not limited to, restrictions on the application of rate increases to existing and new balances, payment allocation, default pricing, imposition of late fees and two-cycle billing. The failure to comply with, or adverse changes in, the laws or regulations to which our business is subject, or adverse changes in their interpretation, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to collect our receivables and generate fees on the receivables, thereby adversely affecting our profitability.
Our bank subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal and state regulation that may require us to make capital contributions to them, and that may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to make cash available to us.
Federal and state laws and regulations extensively regulate the operations of Comenity Bank, as well as Comenity Capital Bank. Many of these laws and regulations are intended to maintain the safety and soundness of Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank, and they impose significant restraints on them to which other non-regulated entities are not subject.
15 Index As a state bank, Comenity Bank is subject to overlapping supervision by the State of Delaware and the FDIC. As a Utah industrial bank, Comenity Capital Bank is subject to overlapping supervision by the FDIC and the State of Utah. Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank must maintain minimum amounts of regulatory capital. If Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank do not meet these capital requirements, their respective regulators have broad discretion to institute a number of corrective actions that could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank, as institutions insured by the FDIC, must maintain certain capital ratios, paid-in capital minimums and adequate allowances for loan loss. If either Comenity Bank or Comenity Capital Bank were to fail to meet any of the capital requirements to which it is subject, we may be required to provide them with additional capital, which could impair our ability to service our indebtedness. To pay any dividend, Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank must each maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. Accordingly, neither Comenity Bank nor Comenity Capital Bank may be able to make any of its cash or other assets available to us, including to service our indebtedness.
If our bank subsidiaries fail to meet certain criteria, we may become subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act, which could force us to cease all of our non-banking activities and lead to a drastic reduction in our profits and revenue.
If either of our depository institution subsidiaries failed to meet the criteria for the exemption from the definition of bank in the Bank Holding Company Act under which it operates (which exemptions are described below), and if we did not divest such depository institution upon such an occurrence, we would become subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act. This would require us to cease certain of our activities that are not permissible for companies that are subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act. One of our depository institution subsidiaries, Comenity Bank, is a Delaware State FDIC-insured bank and a limited-purpose credit card bank located in Delaware. Comenity Bank will not be a bank as defined under the Bank Holding Company Act so long as it remains in compliance with the following requirements: it engages only in credit card operations;  it does not accept demand deposits or deposits that the depositor may withdraw by check or similar means for payment to third parties;  it does not accept any savings or time deposits of less than $100,000, except for deposits pledged as collateral for its extensions of credit; it maintains only one office that accepts deposits; and it does not engage in the business of making commercial loans (except small business loans).
Our other depository institution subsidiary, Comenity Capital Bank, is a Utah industrial bank that is authorized to do business by the State of Utah and the FDIC. Comenity Capital Bank will not be a bank as defined under the Bank Holding Company Act so long as it remains an industrial bank in compliance with the following requirements:  it is an institution organized under the laws of a state which, on March5, 1987, had in effect or had under consideration in such states legislature a statute which required or would require such institution to obtain insurance under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act; and  it does not accept demand deposits that the depositor may withdraw by check or similar means for payment to third parties.
Operational and Other Risk We rely on third party vendors to provide products and services. Our profitability could be adversely impacted if they fail to fulfill their obligations.
The failure of our suppliers to deliver products and services in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect our business. If our significant vendors were unable to renew our existing contracts, we might not be able to replace the related product or service at the same cost which would negatively impact our profitability.
Failure to safeguard our databases and consumer privacy could affect our reputation among our clients and their customers, and may expose us to legal claims.
Although we have extensive physical and cyber security and associated procedures, our databases have in the past been and in the future may be subject to unauthorized access. In such instances of unauthorized access, the integrity of our databases have in the past been and may in the future be affected. Security and privacy concerns may cause consumers to resist providing the personal data necessary to support our profiling capability.
The use of our loyalty, marketing services or credit card programs could decline if any compromise of physical or cyber security occurred. In addition, any unauthorized release of customer information or any publicperception that we released consumer information without authorization, could subject us to legal claims from our clients or their customers, consumers or regulatory enforcement actions, which may adversely affect our client relationships.
16 Index Loss of data center capacity, interruption due to cyber attacks, loss of telecommunication links, computer viruses or inability to utilize proprietary software of third party vendors could affect our ability to timely meet the needs of our clients and their customers.
Our ability, and that of our third-party service providers, to protect our data centers against damage, loss or inoperability from fire, power loss, cyber attacks, telecommunications failure, computer viruses and other disasters is critical. In order to provide many of our services, we must be able to store, retrieve, process and manage large amounts of data as well as periodically expand and upgrade our database capabilities. Any damage to our data centers, or those of our third-party service providers, any failure of our telecommunication links that interrupts our operations or any impairment of our ability to use our software or the proprietary software of third party vendors, including impairments due to cyber attacks, could adversely affect our ability to meet our clients needs and their confidence in utilizing us for future services.
Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position, and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third party allegations of infringement may be costly.
Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our trademarks or other intellectual property rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. The actions we take to protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights may not be adequate. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. We may not be able to prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information. Any infringement or misappropriation could harm any competitive advantage we currently derive or may derive from our proprietary rights. Third parties may also assert infringement claims against us. Any claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages. An adverse determination in any litigation of this type could require us to design around a third partys patent or to license alternative technology from another party. In addition, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of our time and resources. Any claims from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims.
Our international operations, acquisitions and personnel may require us to comply with complex United States and international laws and regulations in the various foreign jurisdictions where we do business.
Our operations, acquisitions and employment of personnel outside the United States may require us to comply with numerous complex laws and regulations of the United States government and those of the various international jurisdictions where we do business. These laws and regulations may apply to a company, or individual directors, officers, employees or agents of such company, and may restrict our operations, investment decisions or joint venture activities. Specifically, we may be subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA; the United Kingdoms Bribery Act 2010, or UKBA; and Canadas Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, or CFPOA. These anti-corruption laws generally prohibit providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purpose of influencing official decisions, obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining preferential treatment and require us to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal controls to ensure that our books and records accurately reflect transactions. As part of our business, we or our partners may do business with state-owned enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA, UKBA or CFPOA. There can be no assurance that our policies, procedures, training and compliance programs will effectively prevent violation of all United States and international laws and regulations with which we are required to comply, and such a violation may subject us to penalties that could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, some of the international jurisdictions in which we operate may lack a developed legal system, have elevated levels of corruption, maintain strict currency controls, present adverse tax consequences or foreign ownership requirements, require difficult or lengthy regulatory approvals, or lack enforcement for non-compete agreements, among other obstacles.
Future sales of our common stock, or the perception that future sales could occur, may adversely affect our common stock price.
As of February24, 2014, we had an aggregate of 96,497,318 shares of our common stock authorized but unissued and not reserved for specific purposes. In general, we may issue all of these shares without any action or approval by our stockholders. We have reserved 24,003,000 shares of our common stock for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan and our long-term incentive plans, of which 1,015,326 shares are issuable upon vesting of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and upon exercise of options granted as of February24, 2014, including options to purchase approximately 221,774 shares exercisable as of February24, 2014 or that will become exercisable within 60 days after February24, 2014. We have reserved for issuance 1,500,000 shares of our common stock, 759,194 of which remain issuable, under our 401(k) and Retirement Savings Plan as of December31, 2013. In addition, we may pursue acquisitions of competitors and related businesses and may issue shares of our common stock in connection with these acquisitions. Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock, and any sale or issuance of our common stock will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders.
17 Index Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents, Delaware law and the fundamental change purchase rights of our convertible senior notes may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent or delay change of control transactions or attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.
Delaware law, as well as provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and debt instruments, could discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire us, even though such proposals may be beneficial to our stockholders.
These include:  our boards authority to issue shares of preferred stock without further stockholder approval; and  fundamental change purchase rights of our convertible senior notes, which allow such note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their convertible senior notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, as well as provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with make-whole fundamental changes.
In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or delay or prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium over the market price of our common stock that they might otherwise receive.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Overview We are a leading global provider of data-driven marketing and loyalty solutions. We offer a comprehensive portfolio of integrated outsourced marketing solutions, including customer loyalty programs, database marketing services, marketing strategy consulting, analytics and creative services, direct marketing services and private label and co-brand retail credit card programs. We focus on facilitating and managing interactions between our clients and their customers through all consumer marketing channels, including in-store, online, catalog, mail, telephone and email, and emerging channels such as mobile and social media. We capture and analyze data created during each customer interaction, leveraging the insight derived from that data to enable clients to identify and acquire new customers and to enhance customer loyalty. We believe that our services are becoming increasingly valuable as businesses shift marketing resources away from traditional mass marketing toward highly targeted marketing programs that provide measurable returns on marketing investments. We operate in the following reportable segments: LoyaltyOne, Epsilon, and Private Label Services and Credit.
LoyaltyOne LoyaltyOne generates revenue primarily from our coalition loyalty program in Canada, the AIR MILES Reward Program. Revenue increased $0.4 million to $919.5 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 9.5% to $258.5 million for the year ended December31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012.
LoyaltyOnes revenues are primarily earned in Canada, and can therefore be impacted by changes in the foreign currency exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. A weaker Canadian dollar negatively impacted the results of operations for the year ended December31, 2013, as the average foreign currency exchange rate was $0.97 as compared to $1.00 in the prior year period, which lowered revenue and adjusted EBITDA by $26.9 million and $8.0 million, respectively.
AIR MILES reward miles issued and AIR MILES reward miles redeemed are the two primary drivers of LoyaltyOnes revenue and indicators of success of the program. The number of AIR MILES reward miles issued impacts the number of future AIR MILES reward miles available to be redeemed. This can also impact our future revenue recognized with respect to the number of AIR MILES reward miles redeemed and the amount of breakage for those AIR MILES reward miles expected to remain unredeemed.
AIR MILES reward miles issued during the year ended December31, 2013 increased 3.8% compared to the same period in the prior year due to the addition of new sponsors and strength in consumer credit card spending. AIR MILES reward miles redeemed during the year ended December31, 2013 decreased 0.6% compared to the same period in the prior year.
As discussed in the Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for those sponsor contracts not yet subject to Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, the allocation of the fees received from AIR MILES reward miles issued is allocated to the redemption element based on the fair value of the redemption element, and the service element is determined based on the residual method. The adoption of ASU 2009-13 eliminates the use of the residual method for new sponsor agreements entered into, or existing sponsor agreements that are materially modified, after January 1, 2011. For these agreements, we determine the selling price for all of the deliverables in the arrangement, and use the relative selling price method to allocate the arrangement consideration among the deliverables.
In the first quarter of 2013, we renewed our agreements with two of our top five sponsors. As part of our analysis, it was determined that in addition to the redemption and service elements, the right to use of the AIR MILES brand name met the criteria for a separate deliverable or element under ASU 2009-13. As a result, for those sponsor contracts within the scope of ASU 2009-13, proceeds from the issuance of AIR MILES reward miles are allocated to three elements: the redemption element, the service element and the brand element, based on the relative selling price method.
Revenue for the redemption element is recognized at the time an AIR MILES reward mile is redeemed. For the service element, revenue is recognized over the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile. Revenue attributable to the brand element is recognized at the time an AIR MILES reward mile is issued. For the year ended December31, 2013, we recognized $33.5 million associated with the brand element, which is included as transaction revenue in the consolidated statements of income.
Also, based on the analysis of historical redemption trends and additional statistical analysis performed, including the impact of changes in the program structure, we determined that our estimate of breakage had changed from 27% to 26% as of December 31, 2013. The change in estimate will have no impact on the total redemption liability but is expected to reduce earnings in 2014 by approximately $30 million. We expect to mitigate this loss with lower operating expenses and higher product margins.
AIR MILES Cash, an instant reward option added to the AIR MILES Reward Program in March 2012, continues to expand with over 1.9 million collectors. We currently have 10 participating sponsors that can process instant redemptions of AIR MILES reward miles collected in the AIR MILES Cash program option. For the year ended December 31, 2013, AIR MILES Cash represented approximately 12% of the AIR MILES reward miles issued. We have not recognized any breakage associated with AIR MILES Cash in 2012 and 2013 and do not expect to recognize any breakage associated with AIR MILES Cash until we have sufficient evidence to make the assessment.
25 Index During the year ended December31, 2013, LoyaltyOne signed new multi-year agreements with Old Navy, a leading retailer of family apparel; Eastlink, a privately-held Canadian telecommunications company; Irving Oil, a regional energy and marketing company; and Staples Canada, Inc., Canadas largest supplier of office supplies, technology, office furniture and business services, to participate as sponsors in the AIR MILES Reward Program.
We currently own approximately 37% of CBSM-Companhia Brasileira De Servicos De Marketing, the operator of the dotz coalition loyalty program in Brazil. In 2013, dotz expanded the number of regions in Brazil in which it operates from five regions with more than six million customers to nine regions with more than 10 million customers enrolled in the program. We expect dotz to enter into four additional markets in Brazil during 2014. Our investment in dotz did not have a significant impact on our results of operations in 2012 and 2013, and we are not expecting it to have a significant impact on our results of operations in 2014.
Further, on January 2, 2014, we acquired a 60% ownership interest in BrandLoyalty Group B.V., a Netherlands-based, data-driven loyalty marketer, as further described in Item 1, Business. BrandLoyalty will be consolidated in our financial statements and included in our results of operations as of the date of acquisition.
Epsilon Epsilon is a leading marketing services firm providing end-to-end, integrated marketing solutions that leverage transactional data to help clients more effectively acquire and build stronger relationships with their customers. Services include strategic consulting, customer database technologies, loyalty management, proprietary data, predictive modeling and a full range of direct and digital agency services.
Revenue increased 38.6% to $1.4 billion and adjusted EBITDA increased 30.3% to $289.7 million for the year ended December31, 2013. These increases were driven by the acquisition of HMI in November 2012 as well as strength in the telecommunications and automotive verticals.
During the year ended December31, 2013, Epsilon announced new multi-year agreements with the National Football League to provide database and email marketing services, Dunkin Donuts to provide technology for its new loyalty initiative, and Road Scholar, a not-for-profit organization providing adults with educational travel opportunities worldwide, to provide database marketing services.
Epsilon signed multi-year renewal and expansion agreements with The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society to continue to provide database management services and to provide comprehensive marketing campaign management services, AT&T to continue to provide data and agency services, and Kroger, one of the worlds largest retailers, to continue to provide permission-based email marketing deployment and to provide strategic, creative and analytic services.
Epsilon also renewed multi-year agreements with Marriott International, Inc., a leading lodging company, to continue to support email deployment, strategy and creative services for its loyalty program, Guthy-Renker, one of the worlds largest direct marketing companies, to continue to provide database, data and permission-based email marketing services, and Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group, one of the worlds largest hotel groups, to continue to provide email marketing services.
Private Label Services and Credit The Private Label Services and Credit segment provides risk management solutions, account origination, funding services, transaction processing, marketing, customer care and collection services for our more than 120 private label retail and co-branded credit card programs.
Revenue, generated primarily from finance charges and late fees as well as other servicing fees, increased 17.5% to $2.0 billion and adjusted EBITDA increased 11.3% to $916.1 million for the year ended December31, 2013 as compared to the prior year.
For the year ended December31, 2013, average credit card and loan receivables increased 21.7% as compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of increased credit sales, recent client signings and recent credit card portfolio acquisitions. Credit sales increased 21.8% for the year ended December31, 2013 due to strong credit cardholder spending, recent new client signings and recent credit card portfolio acquisitions.
Delinquency rates were 4.2% of principal credit card and loan receivables at December31, 2013 as compared to 4.0% at December31, 2012. The principal net charge-off rate improved to 4.7% for the year ended December31, 2013 as compared to 4.8% in the prior year period. We expect our 2014 charge-off rate to be consistent with 2013.
26 Index During the year ended December31, 2013, we announced the signings of certain agreements to provide private label credit card services to Lifestyle Lift, Dwolla, Orchard Brands, El Dorado Furniture, Aspen Dental and Tiger Direct. We also announced the signing of a new multi-year agreement with Zale Corporation to provide private label credit card services and to acquire the existing credit card portfolio at a future date. We announced the signing of a multi-year renewal agreement with Z Gallerie to continue providing private label credit card services.
Additionally, we announced the signings of certain agreements to provide co-brand credit card services to Excentus Corporation, CREDO, The Geddes Group, Ohio University Alumni Association, Caesars Entertainment Corporation and Gander Mountain. We also announced the signing of a new multi-year agreement with Coldwater Creek to provide co-brand and private label credit card services and to acquire the existing co-brand credit card portfolio at a future date.
In March 2013, we purchased the existing private label credit card portfolio of Barneys New York for a total purchase price of $37.1 million.
In August 2013, we announced the signing of new multi-year agreements with subsidiaries of eBay, Inc., or collectively, PayPal, to become an issuer for their Bill Me Later credit products. After issuance, these loan receivables are sold to PayPal at par value plus accrued interest. Upon PayPals purchase of the originated loan receivables, we are obligated to purchase a participating interest in the pool of loan receivables generated in the Bill Me Later program.
Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies that are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our judgments and estimates in determination of our financial condition and operating results. Estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and, accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates, sometimes materially. Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require managements most subjective judgments. The primary critical accounting policies and estimates are described below.
Allowance for Loan Loss.
We maintain an allowance for loan loss at a level that is appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in credit card and loan receivables. The allowance for loan loss covers forecasted uncollectable principal as well as unpaid interest and fees. The allowance for loan loss is evaluated monthly for adequacy. In estimating the allowance for principal loan losses, we utilize a migration analysis of delinquent and current credit card and loan receivables. Migration analysis is a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a credit card or loan receivable will progress through the various stages of delinquency and to charge-off. The allowance is maintained through an adjustment to the provision for loan loss. Charge-offs of principal amounts, net of recoveries, are deducted from the allowance.
Net charge-offs include the principal amount of losses from credit cardholders unwilling or unable to pay their account balances, as well as bankrupt and deceased credit cardholders, less recoveries and exclude charged-off interest, fees and fraud losses. Charged-off interest and fees reduce finance charges, net while fraud losses are recorded as an expense. Credit card and loan receivables, including unpaid interest and fees, are charged-off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 180 days contractually past due, except in the case of customer bankruptcies or death. Credit card and loan receivables, including unpaid interest and fees, associated with customer bankruptcies or death are charged-off at the end of each month subsequent to 60 days after the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death, but in any case, not later than the 180-day contractual time frame.
We record the actual charge-offs for unpaid interest and fees as a reduction to finance charges, net. In estimating the allowance for uncollectable unpaid interest and fees, we utilize historical charge-off trends, analyzing actual charge-offs for the prior three months. The allowance for unpaid interest and fees is maintained through an adjustment to finance charges, net.
In evaluating the allowance for loan loss for both principal and unpaid interest and fees, management also considers factors that may impact loan loss experience, including seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates and forecasting uncertainties. If management used different assumptions in estimating net losses that could be incurred, the impact to the allowance for loan loss could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For example, a 100 basis point change in managements estimate of incurred net loan losses could have resulted in a change of approximately $84.6 million in the allowance for loan loss at December31, 2013, with a corresponding change in the provision for loan loss.
27 Index Revenue Recognition.
We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) collectability is reasonably assured; and (iv) the service has been performed or the product has been delivered. We may also enter into contracts that contain multiple deliverables. Judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. Moreover, judgment is used to interpret the terms and determine when all the criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. While changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition.
AIR MILES Reward Program.
The AIR MILES Reward Program collects fees from its sponsors based on the number of AIR MILES reward miles issued and, in limited circumstances, the number of AIR MILES reward miles redeemed. Because management has determined that the earnings process is not complete at the time an AIR MILES reward mile is issued, the recognition of redemption and service revenue is deferred. Redemption revenue is recognized as AIR MILES reward miles are redeemed and service revenue is amortized over the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile.
Under certain of our contracts, a portion of the proceeds is paid to us upon the issuance of AIR MILES reward miles and a portion is paid at the time of redemption and therefore, we do not have a redemption obligation related to these contracts. Revenue is recognized at the time of redemption. Under such contracts, the proceeds received at issuance are initially deferred as service revenue and revenue is amortized over the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile.
For those sponsor contracts not yet subject to the adoption of ASU 2009-13, we allocate the proceeds received from sponsors for the issuance of AIR MILES reward miles between the redemption element which represents the award ultimately provided to the collector (the redemption element) and the service element (the service element). The service element consists of direct marketing and support services. For contracts entered into prior to January1, 2011, revenue related to the service element is determined using the residual method.
The adoption of ASU 2009-13 eliminated the use of the residual method for new sponsor agreements entered into, or existing sponsor agreements that are materially modified, after January1, 2011. ASU 2009-13 also established the use of a three-level hierarchy when establishing the selling price and the relative selling price method when allocating arrangement consideration. The ASU had no significant impact upon adoption in 2011, as no new material contracts or material modifications were experienced with sponsors in the AIR MILES Reward Program from its adoption through December31, 2012.
In the first quarter of 2013, we renewed our agreements with two of our top five sponsors. As part of our analysis, it was determined that in addition to the redemption and service elements, the right to use of the AIR MILES brand name met the criteria for a separate deliverable or element under ASU2009-13. For the brand element, revenue is recognized at the time an AIR MILES reward mile is issued.
For those sponsor contracts within the scope of ASU2009-13, proceeds from the issuance of AIR MILES reward miles are allocated to three elements, the redemption element, the service element, and the brand element, based on the relative selling price method. The fair value of each element was determined using managements estimated selling price for that respective element. The objective of using the estimated selling price methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. Accordingly, we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods, including discounted cash flows, the estimated brand value and the number of AIR MILES reward miles issued and redeemed. We estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the respective agreements in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple elements delivered.
The amount of revenue recognized in a period is subject to the estimate of breakage and the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile. Breakage and the life of an AIR MILES reward mile are based on managements estimate after viewing and analyzing various historical trends including vintage analysis, current run rates and other pertinent factors, such as the impact of macroeconomic factors and changes in the program structure.
Redemption revenue recognized is impacted by our estimate of breakage, or those AIR MILES reward miles that we estimate will remain unredeemed by the collector base.
Service revenue recognized in a period is subject to the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile, or 42 months.
Based on the analysis of historical redemption trends and additional statistical analysis performed, including the impact of changes in the program structure, we determined that our estimate of breakage had changed from 27% to 26% as of December 31, 2013. The change in estimate will have no impact on the total redemption liability but is expected to reduce earnings in 2014 by approximately $30 million, absent any changes to the AIR MILES Reward Program.
28 Index There have been no changes to managements estimate of the life of an AIR MILES reward miles in the periods presented in the financial statements. We estimate that an increase (decrease) to the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile of one month would decrease (increase) transaction revenue by approximately $6 million.
As of December31, 2013, we had $1.1 billion in deferred revenue related to the AIR MILES Reward Program that will be recognized in the future. Further information is provided in Note 10, Deferred Revenue, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Income Taxes.
We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC740, Income Taxes. The application of income tax law is inherently complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures. Interpretations of, and guidance surrounding, income tax laws and regulations change over time. Changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. See Note15, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on our uncertain tax positions and further information regarding ASC740.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Recently Issued Accounting Standards under Note2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of certain accounting standards that we have not yet been required to adopt and may be applicable to our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus stock compensation expense, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, merger and other costs, depreciation and other amortization and amortization of purchased intangibles.
We use adjusted EBITDA as an integral part of our internal reporting to measure the performance of our reportable segments. Adjusted EBITDA is considered an important indicator of the operational strength of our businesses. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the uneven effect across all business segments of considerable amounts of non-cash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of intangible assets, including certain intangible assets that were recognized in business combinations. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our businesses. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets, as well as asset sales through other financial measures, such as capital expenditures, investment spending and return on capital and therefore the effects are excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA also eliminates the non-cash effect of stock compensation expense. Stock compensation expense is not included in the measurement of segment adjusted EBITDA provided to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocations. Therefore, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to our investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a performance measure that should be regarded as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, either operating income or net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In addition, adjusted EBITDA is not intended to represent funds available for dividends, reinvestment or other discretionary uses, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP.
29 Index The adjusted EBITDA measure presented in this Annual Report on Form10-K may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in our various agreements.

Total revenue increased $677.7 million, or 18.6%, to $4.3 billion for the year ended December31, 2013 from $3.6 billion for the year ended December31, 2012. The net increase was due to the following:  Transaction . Revenue increased $28.2 million, or 9.4%, to $329.0 million for the year ended December31, 2013. AIR MILES reward miles issuance fees, for which we provide marketing and administrative services, increased $40.0 million due to $33.5 million of revenue recognized associated with the AIR MILES brand element, as well as increases in the number of AIR MILES reward miles issued in previous quarters. Other servicing fees charged to our credit cardholders increased $30.0 million, offset by a decrease of $41.7 million in merchant fees, which are transaction fees charged to the retailer, due to increased royalty payments associated with the signing of new clients.
Redemption . Revenue decreased $48.3million, or 7.6%, to $587.2 million for the year ended December31, 2013 due to the impact of the change in estimate of our breakage rate in December 2012, a slight decrease in AIR MILES reward miles redeemed, and an unfavorable exchange rate. The decline in the Canadian dollar impacted redemption revenue by $17.1 million.
Finance charges, net . Revenue increased $313.2 million, or 19.1%, to $2.0 billion for the year ended December31, 2013. This increase was driven by a 21.7% increase in average credit card and loan receivables, which have increased approximately $1.3 billion through a combination of recent credit card portfolio acquisitions and strong credit cardholder spending. This was offset in part by a 60 basis point decline in gross yield primarily due to the onboarding of new credit card portfolios.
Database marketing fees and direct marketing . Revenue increased $357.8 million, or 38.4%, to $1.3 billion for the year ended December31, 2013. The increase in revenue was driven by increases within our Epsilon segment, including our acquisition of HMI, which added $272.6 million and an increase in agency revenue of $61.2 million due to demand in the telecommunications and automotive verticals. Additionally, marketing technology revenue increased $21.7 million due to new database builds that were placed in service during the year ended December31, 2013, offset by declines in email volume experienced by our digital business.
Other revenue . Revenue increased $26.7 million, or 20.5%, to $156.8 million for the year ended December31, 2013 due to additional consulting services provided by Epsilon, particularly in the telecommunications vertical.
Cost of operations . Cost of operations increased $442.5 million, or 21.0%, to $2.5 billion for the year ended December31, 2013 as compared to $2.1 billion for the year ended December31, 2012. The increase resulted from growth across each of our segments, including the following:  Within the LoyaltyOne segment, cost of operations decreased $20.5 million due to a $20.7 million decrease in fulfillment costs for the AIR MILES Reward Program associated with the decline in AIR MILES reward miles redeemed as well as a reduction in losses associated with international expansion. These decreases were partially offset by increases in payroll and benefits of $1.7 million and marketing expenses of $2.0 million. The impact of the exchange rate reduced cost of operations by $19.0 million and is reflected in the changes described above.
Within the Epsilon segment, cost of operations increased $320.6 million due to the HMI acquisition, which added $234.6 million, as well as an increase of $68.1 million in cost of operations associated with the increase in agency and consulting revenue.
Within the Private Label Services and Credit segment, cost of operations increased by $151.6 million. Payroll and benefits increased $72.1 million due to an increase in the number of associates to support growth, and marketing expenses increased $24.0 million due to the increase in credit sales. Other operating expenses increased by $55.5 million, as credit card processing expenses were higher due to an increase in the number of statements generated, and data processing costs increased due to growth in volumes.
Provision for loan loss . Provision for loan loss increased $60.3 million, or 21.1%, to $345.8 million for the year ended December31, 2013 as compared to $285.5 million for the year ended December31, 2012. The increase in the provision was a result of the growth in credit card and loan receivables, offset in part by stabilized credit quality. The net charge-off rate was 4.7% for the year ended December31, 2013 as compared to 4.8% for the year ended December31, 2012. Delinquency rates were 4.2% of principal credit card and loan receivables at December31, 2013 as compared to 4.0% at December31, 2012.
General and administrative . General and administrative expenses increased $1.0 million, or 1.0%, to $109.1 million for the year ended December31, 2013 as compared to $108.1 million for the year ended December31, 2012 due to higher payroll costs and higher data processing costs, offset by lower Corporate benefit costs.
32 Index Depreciation and other amortization . Depreciation and other amortization increased $10.5 million, or 14.2%, to $84.3 million for the year ended December31, 2013, as compared to $73.8 million for the year ended December31, 2012, due to additional assets placed into service resulting from both the HMI acquisition and recent capital expenditures.
Amortization of purchased intangibles . Amortization of purchased intangibles increased $38.7 million, or 41.6%, to $131.8 million for the year ended December31, 2013 as compared to $93.1 million for the year ended December31, 2012. The increase relates to $31.1 million of additional amortization associated with the intangible assets from the HMI acquisition as well as recent credit card portfolio acquisitions.
Interest expense, net . Total interest expense, net increased $14.0 million, or 4.8%, to $305.5 million for the year ended December31, 2013 as compared to $291.5 million for the year ended December31, 2012. The increase was due to the following:  Securitization funding costs . Securitization funding costs increased $2.5 million due to greater average borrowings for the year ended December31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December31, 2012. These increases were offset by lower average interest rates.
Interest expense on deposits . Interest on deposits increased $3.9 million as increases from higher borrowings were offset by lower average interest rates.
Interest expense on long-term and other debt, net . Interest expense on long-term and other debt, net increased $7.6 million due to an increase of $27.1 million resulting from the issuances of senior notes in 2012 and an increase of $2.3 million related to term debt as increases from higher borrowings were offset by lower average interest rates. These increases were offset in part by the maturity of the 2013 convertible senior notes on August 1, 2013 which resulted in a decrease in interest expense of $23.8 million, including a reduction of the imputed interest, compared to the prior year period.
Taxes . Income tax expense increased $36.6 million to $297.2 million for the year ended December31, 2013 from $260.6 million for the year ended December31, 2012 due primarily to an increase in taxable income, offset in part by a decline in the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for the year ended December31, 2013 improved to 37.5% as compared to 38.2% for the year ended December31, 2012 due to the reinvestment of international profits into international expansion efforts. We expect a similar rate for 2014.
Year ended December31, 2012 compared to the year ended December31, 2011 Revenue . Total revenue increased $468.1 million, or 14.8%, to $3.6 billion for the year ended December31, 2012 from $3.2 billion for the year ended December31, 2011. The net increase was due to the following:  Transaction . Revenue increased $10.2 million, or 3.5%, to $300.8 million for the year ended December31, 2012 due to an increase of $13.5 million in AIR MILES reward miles issuance fees, for which we provide marketing and administrative services, as a result of increases in the number of AIR MILES reward miles issued over the previous several quarters. Other servicing fees charged to our credit cardholders also increased transaction revenue by $20.5 million. These increases were offset by a decrease of $20.8 million in lower merchant fees, which are transaction fees charged to the retailer, primarily due to increased profit sharing and royalty payments associated with the signing of new clients.
Redemption . Revenue increased $63.0 million, or 11.0%, to $635.5 million for the year ended December31, 2012 due to an 11.2% increase in AIR MILES reward miles redeemed. The introduction of a five-year expiry policy to the AIR MILES Reward Program in December2011 stimulated redemption activity through the first half of 2012.
Finance charges, net . Revenue increased $241.4 million, or 17.2%, to $1.6 billion for the year ended December31, 2012. This increase was driven by a 19.4% increase in average credit card receivables due to strong credit cardholder spending, the stabilization of customer payment rates, as well as recent client signings and credit card portfolio acquisitions, offset in part by a 50 basis point decline in gross yield related to the recent credit card portfolio acquisitions.
Database marketing fees and direct marketing . Revenue increased $125.1 million, or 15.5%, to $931.5 million for the year ended December31, 2012. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by our acquisitions of HMI and Aspen, which added $30.8 million and $92.9 million, respectively.
Other revenue . Revenue increased $28.4 million, or 27.9%, to $130.1 million for the year ended December31, 2012 due to increased revenue associated with strategic consulting initiatives. The Aspen acquisition contributed $19.0 million of this increase.
33 Index Cost of operations . Cost of operations increased $294.7 million, or 16.3%, to $2.1 billion for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to $1.8 billion for the year ended December31, 2011. The increase resulted from growth across each of our segments, including the following:  Within the LoyaltyOne segment, cost of operations increased $57.4 million due to a $19.8 million increase in the cost of fulfillment for the AIR MILES Reward Program as a result of an 11.2% increase in the number of AIR MILES reward miles redeemed. In addition, marketing expenses increased $12.1 million due to costs associated with the launch and promotion of AIR MILES Cash, and payroll and benefit costs increased $16.2 million to support new growth initiatives, including international expansion activities.
Within the Epsilon segment, cost of operations increased $124.8 million due to the acquisitions of HMI and Aspen, which added $26.7 million and $96.9 million, respectively. Cost of operations also increased as a result of enhancements to infrastructure and security as well as a relocation of a data center to support future growth, which were mitigated by cost-saving initiatives and operational efficiencies implemented in 2012.
Within the Private Label Services and Credit segment, cost of operations increased $115.3 million due to growth in the segment. Payroll and benefits increased $39.6 million due to an increase in the number of associates and marketing expenses increased $21.2 million due to growth in credit sales. Credit card and other expenses increased $28.4 million due to higher volumes and growth, and legal and consulting expenses also increased $8.1 million due to new initiatives.
Provision for loan loss . Provision for loan loss decreased $14.8 million, or 4.9%, to $285.5 million for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to $300.3 million for the year ended December31, 2011. The decrease in the provision was a result of improved credit quality, offset in part by the growth in credit card receivables. The net charge-off rate improved 210 basis points to 4.8% for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to 6.9% for the year ended December31, 2011. Delinquency rates improved to 4.0% of principal credit card receivables at December31, 2012 from 4.4% at December31, 2011.
General and administrative . General and administrative expenses increased $12.8 million, or 13.4%, to $108.1 million for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to $95.3 million for the year ended December31, 2011. The increase was driven by payroll and benefit costs as a result of higher medical costs and an increase in expenses for our retirement savings plans, as well as the impact of the amortization of deferred gains in 2011 associated with sale-leaseback transactions that were fully amortized in April2011.
Depreciation and other amortization .
Depreciation and other amortization increased $3.4 million, or 4.8%, to $73.8 million for the year ended December31, 2012, as compared to $70.4 million for the year ended December31, 2011, due to additional assets placed in service resulting from capital expenditures as well as fixed assets acquired in the Aspen and HMI acquisitions.
Amortization of purchased intangibles . Amortization of purchased intangibles increased $10.3 million, or 12.5%, to $93.1 million for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to $82.7 million for the year ended December31, 2011. The increase relates to $9.6 million and $2.6 million of additional amortization associated with the intangible assets acquired in the Aspen and HMI acquisitions, respectively, and additional amortization associated with the intangible assets from recent credit card portfolio acquisitions, offset in part by certain fully amortized intangible assets.
Interest expense, net . Total interest expense, net decreased $7.1 million, or 2.4%, to $291.5 million for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to $298.6 million for the year ended December31, 2011. The decrease was due to the following:  Securitization funding costs . Securitization funding costs decreased $33.9 million due to lower interest rates for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December31, 2011.
Interest expense on deposits . Interest on deposits increased $2.1 million as increases from higher borrowings were offset by lower average interest rates.
Interest expense on long-term and other debt, net . Interest expense on long-term and other debt, net increased $24.7 million due in part to an increase in borrowings resulting from the issuance of senior notes in 2012 which added $26.5 million in interest expense. In addition, the amortization of imputed interest associated with the convertible senior notes increased $8.6 million as compared to the prior year. These increases were offset by a decline in interest expense associated with our credit facility and a decline in the amortization of debt issuance costs resulting from a $2.6 million write-off in unamortized debt costs associated with the early extinguishment of certain previous term loans in the second quarter of 2011.
Taxes . Income tax expense increased $61.8 million to $260.6 million for the year ended December31, 2012 from $198.8 million for the year ended December31, 2011 due primarily to an increase in taxable income, offset in part by a decline in the effective tax rate.
The effective tax rate for the year ended December31, 2012 declined to 38.2% as compared to 38.7% for the year ended December31, 2011 due primarily to the result of settlements of certain state audits and statutory tax rate adjustments in Canada.

Total revenue increased $677.7 million, or 18.6%, to $4.3 billion for the year ended December31, 2013 from $3.6 billion for the year ended December31, 2012. The net increase was due to the following:  LoyaltyOne . Revenue increased $0.4 million to $919.5 million for the year ended December31, 2013. AIR MILES reward miles issuance fees, for which we provide marketing and administrative services, increased $40.0 million due to $33.5 million of revenue recognized associated with the AIR MILES brand element, as well as increases in the number of AIR MILES reward miles issued in previous quarters. Database marketing fees and direct marketing services increased $8.8 million due to an increase in marketing analytic services provided to certain clients. Redemption revenue decreased $48.3 million, or 7.6%, due to the impact of the change in estimate of our breakage rate in December 2012 as well as a slight decline in the number of AIR MILES reward miles redeemed.
The changes in revenue described above include the impacts of an unfavorable Canadian foreign currency exchange rate, which decreased revenue by $26.9 million.
Epsilon . Revenue increased $384.1 million, or 38.6%, to $1.4 billion for the year ended December31, 2013. The acquisition of HMI contributed $273.6 million to revenue. Agency revenue also increased $82.7 million due to increased demand in the telecommunications and automotive verticals. Additionally, marketing technology revenue increased $30.1 million due to new databases placed in service during the year ended December31, 2013, offset by declines in email volumes experienced by our digital business.
35 Index  Private Label Services and Credit . Revenue increased $302.6 million, or 17.5%, to $2.0 billion for the year ended December31, 2013. Finance charges, net increased by $313.2 million, driven by a 21.7% increase in average credit card and loan receivables due to recent credit card portfolio acquisitions and strong credit cardholder spending.

Adjusted EBITDA . Adjusted EBITDA increased $182.5 million, or 15.3%, to $1.4 billion for the year ended December31, 2013 from $1.2 billion for the year ended December31, 2012. The increase was due to the following:  LoyaltyOne .
Adjusted EBITDA increased $22.4 million, or 9.5%, to $258.5 million for the year ended December31, 2013, despite a weaker Canadian dollar which negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA by $8.0 million. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by a reduction in operating expenses, including a decline in losses associated with international expansion activities.
Epsilon . Adjusted EBITDA increased $67.4 million, or 30.3%, to $289.7 million for the year ended December31, 2013. Adjusted EDITDA was positively impacted by the acquisition of HMI, which added $39.8 million to adjusted EBITDA, and growth in agency as discussed above, which resulted in an increase in adjusted EBITDA of $15.5 million. Additionally, Epsilon benefited from the reorganization of its data survey products in 2012, which had a positive impact to adjusted EBITDA of $12.9 million.
Private Label Services and Credit . Adjusted EBITDA increased $92.9 million, or 11.3%, to $916.1 million for the year ended December31, 2013. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by the increase in finance charges, net, offset in part by both an increase in operating expenses due to increased volumes and an increase in the provision for loan loss due to the increase in credit card and loan receivables.
Corporate/Other . Adjusted EBITDA decreased $0.3 million to a loss of $90.1 million for the year ended December31, 2013 related to an increase in payroll costs and higher data processing costs.
Year ended December31, 2012 compared to the year ended December31, 2011 Revenue . Total revenue increased $468.1 million, or 14.8%, to $3.6 billion for the year ended December31, 2012 from $3.2 billion for the year ended December31, 2011. The net increase was due to the following:  LoyaltyOne . Revenue increased $74.3 million, or 8.8%, to $919.0 million for the year ended December31, 2012. Redemption revenue increased $63.0 million, or 11.0%, due to higher collector redemptions compared to the year ended December31, 2011. The introduction of a five-year expiry policy to the AIR MILES Reward Program on December31, 2011 stimulated redemption activity in the first half of 2012. Revenue from issuance fees, for which we provide marketing and administrative services, increased $13.5 million due to increases in the total number of AIR MILES reward miles issued over the previous several quarters. An unfavorable Canadian foreign currency exchange rate impacted revenue by $10.9 million.
Epsilon . Revenue increased $149.1 million, or 17.6%, to $996.2 million for the year ended December31, 2012. The acquisition of HMI contributed $31.0 million to revenue, while the acquisition of Aspen contributed $111.9 million to revenue.

Private Label Services and Credit . Revenue increased $243.2 million, or 16.3%, to $1.7 billion for the year ended December31, 2012. Finance charges and late fees increased by $241.4 million, driven by a 19.4% increase in average credit card and loan receivables due to strong credit cardholder spending, the stabilization of customer payment rates, recent new client signings and recent credit card portfolio acquisitions. Other servicing fees charged to our credit cardholders increased by $20.5 million. These increases were offset by a decrease of $20.8 million in lower merchant fees, which are transaction fees charged to the retailer, primarily due to increased profit sharing and royalty payments associated with the signing of new clients.
Adjusted EBITDA . Adjusted EBITDA increased $182.4 million, or 18.1%, to $1.2 billion for the year ended December31, 2012 from $1.0 billion for the year ended December31, 2011. The increase was due to the following:  LoyaltyOne . Adjusted EBITDA increased $19.0 million, or 8.8%, to $236.1 million for the year ended December31, 2012. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by the increase in AIR MILES reward miles redeemed, partially offset by marketing expenses associated with the launch and promotion of AIR MILES Cash and increases in costs associated with our international initiatives.
36 Index  Epsilon . Adjusted EBITDA increased $26.9 million, or 13.7%, to $222.3 million for the year ended December31, 2012. Adjusted EDITDA was positively impacted by the HMI acquisition, Aspens marketing services product lines and growth in marketing technology. The positive impacts to adjusted EBITDA were somewhat offset by higher payroll and benefit costs, costs associated with a data center relocation and incremental spending on infrastructure and security to support future growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 22.3% for the year ended December31, 2012 from 23.1% for the prior year. The negative impact to adjusted EBITDA margin was due to a shift in revenue mix, as agency products typically carry lower adjusted EBITDA margins, and additional costs to support future growth, as discussed above.
Private Label Services and Credit . Adjusted EBITDA increased $144.9 million, or 21.4%, to $823.2 million for the year ended December31, 2012. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by the increase in finance charges, net and a decline in the provision for loan loss, each as described above, offset by higher operating costs such as payroll and benefits, marketing expenses and credit card and other expenses attributable to growth in the segment.
Corporate/Other . Adjusted EBITDA decreased $13.4 million to a loss of $89.9 million for the year ended December31, 2012. Payroll and benefit costs increased $10.5 million as a result of higher medical costs and an increase in expenses for our retirement savings plans. In addition, in 2011, we recognized $1.2 million in the amortization of deferred gains in 2011 associated with sale-leaseback transactions that were fully amortized in April2011.
Asset Quality Our delinquency and net charge-off rates reflect, among other factors, the credit risk of our credit card and loan receivables, the success of our collection and recovery efforts, and general economic conditions.
Delinquencies . A credit card account is contractually delinquent when we do not receive the minimum payment by the specified due date on the cardholders statement. Our policy is to continue to accrue interest and fee income on all credit card accounts beyond 90 days, except in limited circumstances, until the credit card account balance and all related interest and other fees are paid or charged off, typically at 180 days delinquent. When an account becomes delinquent, a message is printed on the credit cardholders billing statement requesting payment. After an account becomes 30 days past due, a proprietary collection scoring algorithm automatically scores the risk of the account becoming further delinquent. The collection system then recommends a collection strategy for the past due account based on the collection score and account balance and dictates the contact schedule and collections priority for the account. If we are unable to make a collection after exhausting all in-house collection efforts, we may engage collection agencies and outside attorneys to continue those efforts.
The following table presents the delinquency trends of our credit card and loan receivables portfolio: December31, 2013 %of Total December31, 2012 %of Total (Inthousands,exceptpercentages) Receivables outstanding - principal $ 8,166,961 100.0 % $ 7,097,951 100.0 % Principal receivables balances contractually delinquent: 31 to 60 days 114,430 1.4 % 100,479 1.4 % 61 to 90 days 74,700 0.9 62,546 0.9 91 or more days 150,425 1.9 120,163 1.7 Total $ 339,555 4.2 % $ 283,188 4.0 % Net Charge-Offs . Our net charge-offs include the principal amount of losses from cardholders unwilling or unable to pay their account balances, as well as bankrupt and deceased credit cardholders, less recoveries and exclude charged-off interest, fees and fraud losses. Charged-off interest and fees reduce finance charges, net while fraud losses are recorded as an expense. Credit card and loan receivables, including unpaid interest and fees, are charged-off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 180 days contractually past due, except in the case of customer bankruptcies or death. Credit card and loan receivables, including unpaid interest and fees, associated with customer bankruptcies or death are charged-off at the end of each month subsequent to 60 days after the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death, but in any case, not later than the 180-day contractual time frame.
37 Index The net charge-off rate is calculated by dividing net charge-offs of principal receivables for the period by the average credit card and loan receivables for the period. Average credit card and loan receivables represent the average balance of the cardholder receivables at the beginning of each month in the periods indicated. The following table presents our net charge-offs for the periods indicated.
YearEndedDecember31, 2013 2012 2011 (Inthousands,exceptpercentages) Average credit card and loan receivables $ 7,212,678 $ 5,927,562 $ 4,962,503 Net charge-offs of principal receivables 335,547 282,842 340,064 Net charge-offs as a percentage of average credit card and loan receivables 4.7 % 4.8 % 6.9 % Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities . We generated cash flow from operating activities of $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion for the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The decrease in operating cash flows in 2013 was primarily due to an increase in operating assets as well as activity related to receivables held for sale, offset by increased profitability for the year ended December31, 2013 as compared to 2012.
We utilize our cash flow from operations for ongoing business operations, repayments of revolving or other debt, acquisitions and capital expenditures.
Investing Activities . Cash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion and $2.7 billion for the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Significant components of investing activities are as follows:  Redemption Settlement Assets . Cash decreased $54.6 million for the year ended December31, 2013, as compared to a cash increase of $37.2 million for the year ended December31, 2012, due to the increase in funding requirements resulting from the change in our estimate of breakage in December 2012.
Credit Card and Loan Receivables Funding . Cash decreased $1.4 billion for each of the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, due to growth in our credit card and loan receivables.
Purchase of Credit Card Portfolios . Cash decreased $46.7 million for the year ended December31, 2013 due to the acquisition of private label credit card portfolios from Barneys New York and Gulf Credit Union. During the year ended December31, 2012, cash decreased $780.0 million due to the acquisition of private label credit card portfolios from Pier 1 Imports, Premier Designs, The Bon-Ton Stores, Inc. and The Talbots, Inc.
Capital Expenditures . Our capital expenditures for the year ended December31, 2013 were $135.4 million compared to $116.5 million for the comparable period in 2012 due to our overall growth. We anticipate capital expenditures not to exceed approximately 3% of annual revenue for the foreseeable future.
Financing Activities . Cash provided by financing activities was $704.2 million and $2.2 billion for the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our financing activities during the year ended December31, 2013 relate to a net increase in long-term debt from our 2013 credit agreement and repayment of our 2011 credit agreement and increases in deposits and non-recourse borrowings of consolidated securitization entities due to growth in credit card receivables, offset by the settlement of convertible senior notes and repurchases of our common stock. Our financing activities during the year ended December31, 2012 relate to an increase in long-term debt from the issuance of senior notes and increases in deposits and non-recourse borrowings of consolidated securitization entities due to growth in credit card receivables, offset by repurchases of our common stock.
Liquidity Sources . In addition to cash generated from operating activities, our primary sources of liquidity include our credit card securitization program, deposits issued by Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank, our credit agreement and issuances of equity securities. In addition to our efforts to renew and expand our current liquidity sources, we continue to seek new funding sources. We have also expanded our brokered certificates of deposits and our money market deposits to supplement liquidity for our credit card and loan receivables.
As of December31, 2013, we had $336.0 million of borrowings under our credit facility, with total availability at $914.0 million. Our total leverage ratio, as defined in our credit agreement, was 2.0 to 1 at December31, 2013, as compared to the maximum covenant ratio of 3.5 to 1.
38 Index We believe that internally generated funds and other sources of liquidity discussed above will be sufficient to meet working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months, including the settlement of the 2014 convertible senior notes.
Debt 2011 Credit Agreement . We entered into a credit agreement dated May24, 2011, or the 2011 Credit Agreement, which, as amended, provided for a $903.1 million term loan subject to certain principal repayments and a $917.5 million revolving line of credit. Upon entering the 2013 Credit Agreement described below, the 2011 Credit Agreement was terminated.
2013 Credit Agreement.

Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 . On August1, 2013, we settled in cash, with cash on hand and borrowings under the 2013 Credit Agreement, the remaining $772.6 million of Convertible Senior Notes due 2013, of which $772.5 million was surrendered for conversion for $1,790.3 million, with the remaining principal paid at maturity. We applied $1,017.7 million of cash received from certain counterparties in settlement of the related convertible note hedge transactions.
Through December31, 2013, we net settled 5.1 million of the approximately 10.2 million warrants associated with the Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 by issuing 2.8 million shares of our common stock. The remaining 5.1 million warrants are exercisable and will expire in separate tranches through February25, 2014.
Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 . In June 2009, we issued $345.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes maturing in May 2014, or the Convertible Senior Notes due 2014. Holders of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 have the right to require us to repurchase for cash all or some of their Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes.
The Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 are convertible at the option of the holder based on the condition that the common stock trading price exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price. Through December 31, 2013, certain of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 were surrendered for conversion and, in each case, either have been or will be settled in cash following the completion of the applicable cash settlement averaging period. The amounts settled during 2013 were not material. We have elected to repay all conversions solely in cash.
Senior Notes Due 2017.
In November2012, we issued and sold $400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.250% senior notes due December1, 2017, or the Senior Notes due 2017, at an issue price of 98.912% of the aggregate principal amount.

39 Index Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank offer demand deposit programs through contractual arrangements with securities brokerage firms. As of December31, 2013, Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank had $329.8 million in money market deposits outstanding with interest rates that range from 0.01% to 0.12%.

Securitization Program . We sell a majority of the credit card receivables originated by Comenity Bank to WFN Credit Company, LLC, which in turn sells them to World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust, World Financial Network Credit Card Master Note Trust and World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust III, or collectively, the WFN Trusts, as part of our credit card securitization program, which has been in existence since January1996. We also sell our credit card receivables originated by Comenity Capital Bank to World Financial Capital Credit Company, LLC, which in turn sells them to World Financial Capital Master Note Trust, or the WFC Trust. These securitization programs are the primary vehicle through which we finance Comenity Banks and Comenity Capital Banks credit card receivables.
As of December31, 2013, the WFN Trusts and the WFC Trust had approximately $7.1 billion of securitized credit card receivables. Securitizations require credit enhancements in the form of cash, spread deposits, additional receivables and subordinated classes. The credit enhancement is principally based on the outstanding balances of the series issued by the WFN Trusts and the WFC Trust and by the performance of the private label credit cards in these credit card securitization trusts.
Historically, we have used both public and private term asset-backed securities transactions as well as private conduit facilities as sources of funding for our credit card receivables. Private conduit facilities have been used to accommodate seasonality needs and to bridge to completion of asset-backed securitization transactions.
We have secured and continue to secure the necessary commitments to fund our portfolio of securitized credit card receivables originated by Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank. However, certain of these commitments are short-term in nature and subject to renewal. There is not a guarantee that these funding sources, when they mature, will be renewed on similar terms or at all as they are dependent on the asset-backed securitization markets at the time.
At December31, 2013, we had $4.6 billion of non-recourse borrowings of consolidated securitization entities, of which $1.0 billion is due within the next 12 months.
The following table shows the maturities of borrowing commitments as of December31, 2013 for the WFN Trusts and the WFC Trust by year: 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 and Thereafter Total (In thousands) Term notes $ 250,000 $ 393,750 $ 600,000 $ 325,000 $ 1,433,166 $ 3,001,916 Conduit facilities (1) 1,200,000 890,000    2,090,000 Total (2) $ 1,450,000 $ 1,283,750 $ 600,000 $ 325,000 $ 1,433,166 $ 5,091,916 (1) Amount represents borrowing capacity, not outstanding borrowings.
(2) Total amounts do not include $1.4 billion of debt issued by the credit card securitization trusts, which was retained by us and has been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Early amortization events as defined within each asset-backed securitization transaction are generally driven by asset performance. We do not believe it is reasonably likely for an early amortization event to occur due to asset performance. However, if an early amortization event were declared, the trustee of the particular credit card securitization trust would retain the interest in the receivables along with the excess interest income that would otherwise be paid to our bank subsidiary until the credit card securitization investors were fully repaid. The occurrence of an early amortization event would significantly limit or negate our ability to securitize additional credit card receivables.
In 2013, World Financial Network Credit Card Master Note Trust issued $1.2 billion of asset-backed term securities, $282.9 million of which we retained and eliminated from the consolidated financial statements. These securities have maturities of May 2016 and February 2018 and fixed interest rates of 0.91% and 1.61%. Proceeds from these issuances were used to repay $822.3 million of asset-backed term securities that matured in 2013.
40 Index As of December31, 2013, $3.8 billion of asset-backed term securities were outstanding, $0.8 billion of which we retained and eliminated from the consolidated financial statements. These securities have varying maturities from October 2014 through June 2019 and fixed interest rates ranging from 0.91% to 6.75% as of December31, 2013.
We have access to committed undrawn capacity through three conduit facilities to support the funding of our credit card receivables through World Financial Network Credit Card Master Note Trust, World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust III and the WFC Trust. As of December31, 2013, total capacity under the conduit facilities was $2.1 billion, of which $1.6 billion had been drawn and was included in non-recourse borrowings of consolidated securitization entities in the consolidated balance sheets. Borrowings outstanding under each facility bear interest at a margin above the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, or the asset-backed commercial paper costs of each individual conduit provider. The conduits have varying maturities from March2014 to September2015 with variable interest rates ranging from 1.18% to 1.70% as of December31, 2013.
In February 2014, World Financial Network Credit Card Master Note Trust reduced its capacity under the conduit facility from $1.2 billion to $800.0 million.
In February 2014, World Financial Network Credit Card Master Note Trust issued $625.0 million of asset-backed term securities, $175.0 million of which we retained and eliminated from the consolidated financial statements. These securities mature in February 2016 and have a variable interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 0.38%.
See Note 9, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt.
Repurchase of Equity Securities . During 2013, 2012, and 2011, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million, 1.0 million and 2.9 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of $231.1 million, $137.4 million and $240.9 million, respectively. We have Board authorization to acquire $400.0 million of our common stock through December31, 2014.
Contractual Obligations . The following table highlights, as of December31, 2013, our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments by type and period: 2014 2015 & 2016 2017 & 2018 2019 & Thereafter Total (In thousands) Deposits (1) $ 1,566,707 $ 816,910 $ 428,251 $ 63,793 $ 2,875,661 Non-recourse borrowings of consolidated securitization entities (1) 1,103,843 1,913,374 1,021,532 808,845 4,847,594 2013 Credit Facility (1) 7,260 14,519 347,072  368,851 2013 Term Loan (1) 54,900 153,793 1,124,703  1,333,396 Senior notes (1) 52,875 105,750 483,000 539,844 1,181,469 Convertible senior notes (1) 351,069    351,069 Operating leases 67,289 120,189 82,896 116,845 387,219 Software licenses 4,364 4,337   8,701 ASC740 obligations (2)      Purchase obligations (3) 98,524 30,948 26,181 3,828 159,481 Total $ 3,306,831 $ 3,159,820 $ 3,513,635 $ 1,533,155 $ 11,513,441 (1) The deposits, non-recourse borrowings of consolidated securitization entities, 2013 Credit Facility, 2013 Term Loan, senior notes and convertible senior notes represent our estimated debt service obligations, including both principal and interest. Interest was based on the interest rates in effect as of December31, 2013, applied to the contractual repayment period.
(2) Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $117.3 million, of which the timing remains uncertain.
(3) Purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and specifying all significant terms, including the following: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligation amounts disclosed above represent estimates of the minimum for which we are obligated and the time period in which cash outflows will occur. Purchase orders and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table. Purchase obligations include purchase commitments under our AIR MILES Reward Program, minimum payments under support and maintenance contracts and agreements to purchase other goods and services.
We believe that we will have access to sufficient resources to meet these commitments.
Business Acquisition . On January 2, 2014, we acquired a 60% ownership interest in BrandLoyalty Group B.V., a Netherlands-based, data-driven loyalty marketer. BrandLoyalty designs, organizes, implements and evaluates innovative and tailor-made loyalty programs for food retailers. The acquisition expands our presence across Europe and Asia. The initial 41 Index cash consideration was approximately 172.4 million ($235.6 million at January 2, 2014) in addition to the assumption of debt and is subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments. The consideration amount may also be increased through an earn-out provision as defined in the purchase and sale agreement based upon 2014 results. We also have the ability to acquire the remaining 40% interest over a four-year period, 10% per year, based upon predetermined valuation multiples. If specified annual earnings targets are met by BrandLoyalty, we must acquire the additional 10% interest for the year achieved; otherwise the seller has a put option to sell us the 10% interest for the respective year.
Inflation and Seasonality Although we cannot precisely determine the impact of inflation on our operations, we do not believe that we have been significantly affected by inflation. For the most part, we have relied on operating efficiencies from scale and technology, as well as decreases in technology and communication costs, to offset increased costs of employee compensation and other operating expenses. Our revenues, earnings and cash flows are affected by increased consumer spending patterns leading up to and including the holiday shopping period in the third and fourth quarter and, to a lesser extent, during the first quarter as credit card and note receivable balances are paid down.
Legislative and Regulatory Matters Comenity Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the State of Delaware and the FDIC. Comenity Capital Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by both the FDIC and the State of Utah. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, both Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets and liabilities as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Both Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank are limited in the amounts that they can pay as dividends to us.
Quantitative measures established by regulations to ensure capital adequacy require Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. Under the regulations, a well capitalized institution must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6%, a total capital ratio of at least 10% and a leverage ratio of at least 5% and not be subject to a capital directive order. An adequately capitalized institution must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4%, a total capital ratio of at least 8% and a leverage ratio of at least 4%, but 3% is allowed in some cases. Under these guidelines, Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank are considered well capitalized. As of December31, 2013, Comenity Capital Banks Tier1 capital ratio was 14.1%, total capital ratio was 15.4% and leverage ratio was 14.0%, and Comenity Capital Bank was not subject to a capital directive order. As of December31, 2013, Comenity Banks Tier1 capital ratio was 14.2%, total capital ratio was 15.5% and leverage ratio was 14.2%, and Comenity Bank was not subject to a capital directive order.
On April7, 2010, the SEC proposed revised rules for asset-backed securities offerings that, if adopted, would substantially change the disclosure, reporting and offering process for public and private offerings of asset-backed securities, including those offered under our credit card securitization program. On July26, 2011, the SEC re-proposed certain rules relating to the registrant and transaction requirements for the shelf registration of asset-backed securities. If the revised rules for asset-backed securities are adopted in their current form, issuers of publicly offered asset-backed securities would be required to disclose more information regarding the underlying assets. In addition, the proposals would alter the safe-harbor standards for the private placement of asset-backed securities to impose informational requirements similar to those that would apply to registered public offerings of such securities. The SEC also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking relating to the exemptions that our credit card securitization trusts relied on in our credit card securitization program to avoid registration as investment companies. The form that these rules may ultimately take is uncertain at this time, but such rules may impact our ability or desire to issue asset-backed securities in the future.
On March30, 2011, the SEC, the FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and certain other banking regulators proposed regulations that would mandate a five percent risk retention requirement for securitizations, and such regulators issued a re-proposal of the risk retention regulations on August 28, 2013. We cannot predict at this time whether our existing credit card securitization programs will satisfy the new regulatory requirements or whether structural changes to those programs will be necessary. Such risk retention requirements may impact our ability or desire to issue asset-backed securities in the future.
42 Index Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. Our primary market risks include interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and redemption reward risk.
Interest Rate Risk .
Interest rate risk affects us directly in our borrowing activities. Our total borrowing costs were approximately $305.5 million for 2013. To manage our risk from market interest rates, we actively monitor the interest rates and the interest sensitive components to minimize the impact that changes in interest rates have on the fair value of assets, net income and cash flow. To achieve this objective, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates through the use of fixed-rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements. In addition, we may enter into derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to mitigate our interest rate risk on related financial instruments or to lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt. We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for trading or other speculative purposes.
The approach we use to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis, which we believe best reflects the risk inherent in our business. This approach calculates the impact on pre-tax income from an instantaneous and sustained increase in interest rates of 1.0%. In 2013, a 1.0% increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease to fiscal year pre-tax income of approximately $23.9 million. Conversely, a corresponding decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a comparable increase to pre-tax income. Our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of financial instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the appropriateness of the related assumptions.
Credit Risk .
We are exposed to credit risk relating to the credit card loans we make to our clients customers. Our credit risk relates to the risk that consumers using the private label credit cards that we issue will not repay their revolving credit card loan balances. To minimize our risk of credit card loan write-offs, we have developed automated proprietary scoring technology and verification procedures to make risk-based origination decisions when approving new accountholders, establishing their credit limits and applying our risk-based pricing. We also utilize a proprietary collection scoring algorithm to assess accounts for collections efforts if they become delinquent; after exhausting all in-house collection efforts, we may engage collection agencies and outside attorneys to continue those efforts.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk .
We are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. and the Canadian dollar through our significant Canadian operations. In 2014, with the acquisition of BrandLoyalty Group B.V, we will also be exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Euro. We currently do not hedge any of our net investment exposure in our Canadian or European operations. For the year ended December 31, 2013, a 10% increase in the strength of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar would have resulted in an increase in pre-tax income of $23.9 million. Conversely, a corresponding decrease in the strength of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar would result in a comparable decrease to pre-tax income.
Redemption Reward Risk .
Through our AIR MILES Reward Program, we are exposed to potentially increasing reward costs associated primarily with travel rewards. To minimize the risk of rising travel reward costs, we:  have multi-year supply agreements with several Canadian, U.S. and international airlines;  are seeking new supply agreements with additional airlines;  periodically alter the total mix of rewards available to collectors with the introduction of new merchandise rewards, which are typically lower cost per AIR MILES reward mile than air travel;  allow collectors to obtain certain travel rewards using a combination of AIR MILES reward miles and cash or cash alone in addition to using AIR MILES reward miles alone; and  periodically adjust the number of AIR MILES reward miles required to be redeemed to obtain a reward.
A 10% increase in the cost of rewards to satisfy redemptions would have resulted in a decrease in pre-tax income of $41.8 million, as of December31, 2013. Conversely, a corresponding decrease in the cost of rewards to satisfy redemptions would result in a comparable increase to pre-tax income.

Controls and Procedures.
Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of December31, 2013, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of December31, 2013, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. In conducting this evaluation, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (1992) . Based on this evaluation, management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2013.
The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who also audited our consolidated financial statements. Deloitte & Touches attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting appears on page F-3.
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December31, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Alliance Data Systems Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Dallas, Texas February28, 2014 F-2 Index REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Alliance Data Systems Corporation Plano, Texas We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Alliance Data Systems Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

F-8 Index ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ADSC and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
The Company also consolidates any variable interest entity (VIE) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)860, Transfers and Servicing, and ASC810, Consolidation, the Company is the primary beneficiary of World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust (Master Trust), World Financial Network Credit Card Master Note Trust (Master Trust I) and World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust III (Master TrustIII) (collectively, the WFN Trusts), and World Financial Capital Master Note Trust (the WFC Trust). The Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary for the WFN Trusts and the WFC Trust, as it is the servicer for each of the trusts and is a holder of the residual interest. The Company, through its involvement in the activities of the trusts, has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trust, and the obligation (or right) to absorb losses (or receive benefits) of the trust that could potentially be significant.
For investments in any entities in which the Company owns 50% or less of the outstanding voting stock but in which the Company has significant influence over operating and financial decisions, the Company applies the equity method of accounting. In cases where the Company's equity investment is less than 20% and significant influence does not exist, such investments are carried at cost.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Credit Card and Loan Receivables  The Company sells a majority of the credit card receivables originated by Comenity Bank to WFN Credit Company, LLC, which in turn sells them to the WFN Trusts as part of a securitization program. The Company also sells its credit card receivables originated by Comenity Capital Bank to World Financial Capital Credit Company, LLC which in turn sells them to the WFC Trust. The credit card receivables sold to each of the trusts are restricted for securitization investors.
Credit card and loan receivables consist of credit card and loan receivables held for investment and credit card and loan receivables held for sale, if any. All new originations of credit card and loan receivables (except for the amount of new credit card receivables related to existing securitized portfolios transferred to the WFN Trusts or the WFC Trust during the term of a securitization and those originations associated with agreements with subsidiaries of eBay, Inc., further discussed in Note 4, Credit Card and Loan Receivables,) are deemed to be held for investment at origination because management has the intent and ability to hold them for the foreseeable future. Management makes judgments about the Companys ability to fund these credit card and loan receivables through means other than securitization, such as money market deposits, certificates of deposit and other borrowings. In determining what constitutes the foreseeable future, management considers the short average life and homogenous nature of the Companys credit card and loan receivables.
F-9 Index ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) In assessing whether these credit card and loan receivables continue to be held for investment, management also considers capital levels and scheduled maturities of funding instruments used. Management believes that the assertion regarding its intent and ability to hold credit card and loan receivables for the foreseeable future can be made with a high degree of certainty given the maturity distribution of the Companys money market deposits, certificates of deposit and other funding instruments; the historic ability to replace maturing certificates of deposits and other borrowings with new deposits or borrowings; and historic credit card payment activity. Due to the homogenous nature of credit card and loan receivables, amounts are classified as held for investment on an individual client portfolio basis.
Credit card and loan receivables held for sale are determined on an individual client portfolio basis. The Company carries these assets at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. Cash flows associated with credit card portfolios that are purchased with the intent to sell are included in cash flows from operating activities. Cash flows associated with credit card and loan receivables originated or purchased for investment are classified as investing cash flows, regardless of a subsequent change in intent.
Allowance for Loan Loss The Company maintains an allowance for loan loss at a level that is appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in credit card and loan receivables. The allowance for loan loss covers forecasted uncollectable principal as well as unpaid interest and fees. The allowance for loan loss is evaluated monthly for adequacy.
In estimating the allowance for principal loan losses, management utilizes a migration analysis of delinquent and current credit card and loan receivables. Migration analysis is a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a credit card or loan receivable will progress through the various stages of delinquency and to charge-off. The allowance is maintained through an adjustment to the provision for loan loss. Charge-offs of principal amounts, net of recoveries are deducted from the allowance.
In estimating the allowance for uncollectable unpaid interest and fees, the Company utilizes historical charge-off trends, analyzing actual charge-offs for the prior three months. The allowance is maintained through an adjustment to finance charges, net.
In evaluating the allowance for loan loss for both principal and unpaid interest and fees, management also considers factors that may impact loan loss experience, including seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates and forecasting uncertainties.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company analyzes the appropriateness of its allowance for doubtful accounts based on the Companys assessment of various factors, including historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balance, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends, and changes in its customer payment terms and collection trends. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all reasonable means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.
Redemption Settlement Assets, Restricted The cash and investments related to the redemption fund for the AIR MILES Reward Program are subject to a security interest which is held in trust for the benefit of funding redemptions by collectors. These assets are restricted to funding rewards for the collectors by certain of the Companys sponsor contracts. The investments are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income as the investments are classified as available-for-sale.
Property and Equipment Furniture, equipment, computer software and development, buildings and leasehold improvements are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Land is carried at cost and is not depreciated. Depreciation and amortization for furniture, equipment and buildings are computed on a straight-line basis, using estimated lives ranging from one to twenty-one years. Software development is capitalized in accordance with ASC350-40, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other  Internal  Use Software, and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected benefit period, which generally ranges from one to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the remaining lives of the respective leases or the remaining useful lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter. Long-lived assets are tested for impairment when events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable from future cash flows.
Cash Collateral, Restricted Cash collateral, restricted consists of cash and securities and includes spread deposits and excess funding deposits. Spread deposits are held by a trustee or agent and are used to absorb shortfalls in the available net cash flows related to securitized credit card receivables if those available net cash flows are insufficient to satisfy certain obligations of the WFN Trusts and WFC Trust. The spread deposit accounts are recorded in cash collateral, restricted at their estimated fair values. The Company uses a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future cash flows for each asset. The model is based on the weighted average life of the underlying securities and discount rate. Changes in the fair value estimates of the spread deposit accounts are recorded in interest expense, net. The excess funding deposits represent cash amounts deposited with the trustee of the securitizations and are used to supplement sellers interest.
F-10 Index ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are reviewed at least annually for impairment or more frequently if circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred, using the market comparable and discounted cash flow methods.
Separable intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over those useful lives. The Company also defers costs related to the acquisition or licensing of data for the Companys proprietary databases which are used in providing data products and services to customers. These costs are amortized over the useful life of the data, which ranges from one to five years.
Revenue Recognition The Companys policy follows the guidance from ASC605, Revenue Recognition, and Accounting Standards Update (ASU)2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. The Company recognizes revenues when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) collectability is reasonably assured; and (iv) the service has been performed or the product has been delivered.
Transaction The Company earns transaction fees, which are principally based on the number of transactions processed or statements generated and are recognized as such services are performed. Included are reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses.
AIR MILES Reward Program The AIR MILES Reward Program collects fees from its sponsors based on the number of AIR MILES reward miles issued and, in limited circumstances, the number of AIR MILES reward miles redeemed. Because management has determined that the earnings process is not complete at the time an AIR MILES reward mile is issued, the recognition of redemption and service revenue is deferred. Redemption revenue is recognized as AIR MILES reward miles are redeemed and service revenue is amortized over the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile.
For those sponsor contracts not yet subject to the adoption of ASU 2009-13, the Company allocates the proceeds received from sponsors for the issuance of AIR MILES reward miles between the redemption element which represents the award ultimatelyprovided to the collector (the redemption element) and the service element (the service element). The service element consists of direct marketing and support services. For contracts entered into prior to January1, 2011, revenue related to the service element is determined using the residual method.
The adoption of ASU 2009-13 eliminated the use of the residual method for new sponsor agreements entered into, or existing sponsor agreements that are materially modified, after January1, 2011. ASU 2009-13 also established the use of a three-level hierarchy when establishing the selling price and the relative selling price method when allocating arrangement consideration. The ASU had no significant impact upon adoption in 2011, as no new material contracts or material modifications were experienced with sponsors in the AIR MILES Reward Program from its adoption through December31, 2012.
In 2013, as part of the Companys analysis of the renewal of certain contracts, it was determined that in addition to the redemption and service elements, the right to use of the AIR MILES brand name met the criteria for a separate deliverable or element under ASU2009-13. For the brand element, revenue is recognized at the time an AIR MILES reward mile is issued.
For those sponsor contracts within the scope of ASU2009-13, proceeds from the issuance of AIR MILES reward miles are allocated to three elements, the redemption element, the service element, and the brand element, based on the relative selling price method. The fair value of each element was determined using managements estimated selling price for that respective element. The estimated breakage rate changed from 28% to 27%, effective December 31, 2012 and from 27% to 26%, effective December 31, 2013.
Based on its historical analysis, the Company makes a determination as to average life of an AIR MILES reward mile. The estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile is 42 months. There have been no changes to managements estimate of the life of an AIR MILES reward mile in the periods presented in the financial statements.
Finance charges, net Finance charges, net represents revenue earned on customer accounts serviced by the Company, and is recognized in the period in which it is earned. The Company recognizes earned finance charges, interest income and fees on credit card and loan receivables in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements. As discussed in Note4, Credit Card and Loan Receivables, interest and fees continue to accrue on all credit card accounts beyond 90 days, except in limited circumstances, until the credit card account balance and all related interest and other fees are paid or charged off, typically at 180 days delinquent. Charge-offs for unpaid interest and fees as well as any adjustments to the allowance associated with unpaid interest and fees are recorded as a reduction to finance charges, net. Pursuant to ASC Subtopic310-20, Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs, direct loan origination costs on credit card and loan receivables are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a one-year period and recorded as a reduction to finance charges, net. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the remaining unamortized deferred costs related to loan origination were $20.5 million and $16.4 million, respectively, and were recorded in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
F-11 Index ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) Database marketing fees and direct marketing services For maintenance and service programs, revenue is recognized as services are provided. Revenue associated with a new database build is deferred until client acceptance. Upon acceptance, it is then recognized over the term of the related agreement as the services are provided. Revenues from the licensing of data are recognized upon delivery of the data to the customer in circumstances where no update or other obligations exist. Revenue from the licensing of data for which the Company is obligated to provide future updates is recognized on a straight-line basis over the license term.
Revenues from agency and creative services are typically billed based on time and materials or at a fixed price. If billed at a fixed price, revenue is recognized either on a proportional performance or completed contract basis as the services specified in the arrangement are performed or completed, respectively. The determination of proportional performance versus completed contract revenue recognition is dependent on the nature of the services specified in the arrangement.
Taxes assessed on revenue-producing transactions described above are presented on a net basis, and are excluded from revenues.
Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is based only on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, excluding any dilutive effects of options or other dilutive securities. Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive common shares (dilutive stock options, unvested restricted stock and other dilutive securities outstanding during the year).
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for the periods indicated: YearsEndedDecember31, 2013 2012 2011 (Inthousands,exceptpershareamounts) Numerator Net income $ 496,170 $ 422,256 $ 315,286 Denominator Weighted average shares, basic 49,190 50,008 50,687 Weighted average effect of dilutive securities: Shares from assumed conversion of convertible senior notes 8,516 8,645 4,641 Shares from assumed exercise of convertible note warrants 8,482 4,702 1,510 Net effect of dilutive stock options and unvested restricted stock 678 788 966 Denominator for diluted calculation 66,866 64,143 57,804 Basic net income per share $ 10.09 $ 8.44 $ 6.22 Diluted net income per share $ 7.42 $ 6.58 $ 5.45 The Company calculates the effect of its convertible senior notes, which can be settled in cash or shares of common stock, on diluted net income per share as if they will be settled in cash as the Company has elected to settle the convertible senior notes for cash.
Concurrently with the issuance of its convertible senior notes, the Company entered into hedge transactions that are generally expected to offset the potential dilution of the shares from assumed conversion of convertible senior notes.
The Company is also party to prepaid forward contracts to purchase 1,857,400 shares of its common stock that are to be delivered over a settlement period in 2014. The number of shares to be delivered under the prepaid forward contracts is used to reduce weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding.
At December31, 2011, the Company excluded 10.3 million warrants from the calculation of earnings per share as the effect was anti-dilutive.
Currency Translation The assets and liabilities of the Companys subsidiaries outside the U.S., primarily Canada, are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet dates. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Gains and losses resulting from currency transactions are recognized currently in income and those resulting from translation of financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company recognized $(1.0) million, $0.6 million and $(2.7) million in foreign currency transaction (losses) gains for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Leases Rent expense on operating leases is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement and includes executory costs.
Advertising Costs The Company participates in various advertising and marketing programs, including collaborative arrangements with certain clients. The cost of advertising and marketing programs is expensed in the period incurred. The Company has recognized advertising expenses, including advertising on behalf of its clients, of $206.6 million, $166.1 million and $129.0 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
F-12 Index ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) Stock Compensation Expense The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC718, Compensation  Stock Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions, stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized ratably over the requisite service period.
Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2013-02, Reporting Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which expands the disclosure requirements for items reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income by requiring the total changes of each component of other comprehensive income to be disaggregated and separately presenting current period reclassification adjustments from the remainder of other comprehensive income for the period. ASU2013-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December15, 2012 and requires prospective application. ASU2013-02 had no impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, but did add certain disclosure requirements. The related disclosures are presented in Note 14, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists, which provides guidance on financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists. ASU2013-11 requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward when settlement in this manner is available under the governing tax law. ASU 2013-11 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2013 and requires prospective application. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2013-11 to have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

CREDIT CARD AND LOAN RECEIVABLES The Companys credit card and loan receivables are the only portfolio segment or class of financing receivables. Quantitative information about the components of total credit card and loan receivables is presented in the table below: December31, 2013 December31, 2012 (Inthousands) Principal receivables $ 8,166,961 $ 7,097,951 Billed and accrued finance charges 343,521 291,476 Other credit card and loan receivables 124,482 60,205 Total credit card and loan receivables 8,634,964 7,449,632 Less credit card receivables  restricted for securitization investors 7,080,014 6,597,120 Less loan receivables held for sale 62,082  Other credit card and loan receivables $ 1,492,868 $ 852,512 Allowance for Loan Loss The Company maintains an allowance for loan loss at a level that is appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in credit card and loan receivables. The allowance for loan loss covers forecasted uncollectible principal as well as unpaid interest and fees. The allowance for loan loss is evaluated monthly for appropriateness.
In estimating the allowance for principal loan losses, management utilizes a migration analysis of delinquent and current credit card and loan receivables. Migration analysis is a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a credit card or loan receivable will progress through the various stages of delinquency and to charge-off. The allowance is maintained through an adjustment to the provision for loan loss. Charge-offs of principal amounts, net of recoveries are deducted from the allowance. In estimating the allowance for uncollectible unpaid interest and fees, the Company utilizes historical charge-off trends, analyzing actual charge-offs for the prior three months. The allowance is maintained through an adjustment to finance charges, net. In evaluating the allowance for loan loss for both principal and unpaid interest and fees, management also considers factors that may impact loan loss experience, including seasoning, loan volume and amounts, seasonality, payment rates and forecasting uncertainties.
Net charge-offs include the principal amount of losses from credit cardholders unwilling or unable to pay their account balances, as well as bankrupt and deceased credit cardholders, less recoveries and exclude charged-off interest, fees and fraud losses. Charged-off interest and fees reduce finance charges, net while fraud losses are recorded as an expense. Credit card and loan receivables, including unpaid interest and fees, are charged-off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 180 days contractually past due, except in the case of customer bankruptcies or death. Credit card and loan receivables, including unpaid interest and fees, associated with customer bankruptcies or death are charged-off at the end of each month subsequent to 60 days after the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death, but in any case, not later than the 180-day contractual time frame. The Company records the actual charge-offs for unpaid interest and fees as a reduction to finance charges, net. For the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, actual charge-offs for unpaid interest and fees were $240.8 million, $191.1 million and $199.0 million, respectively.
In evaluating the allowance for loan loss for both principal and unpaid interest and fees, management also considers factors that may impact loan loss experience, including seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates and forecasting uncertainties. The following table presents the Companys allowance for loan loss for the periods indicated: YearsEndedDecember31, 2013 2012 2011 (Inthousands) Balance at beginning of period $ 481,958 $ 468,321 $ 518,069 Provision for loan loss 345,758 285,479 300,316 Change in estimate for uncollectible unpaid interest and fees 11,000 11,000 (5,000 ) Recoveries 112,538 97,131 89,764 Principal charge-offs (448,085 ) (379,973 ) (429,828 ) Other   (5,000 ) Balance at end of period $ 503,169 $ 481,958 $ 468,321 F-15 Index ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) Delinquencies A credit card account is contractually delinquent if the Company does not receive the minimum payment by the specified due date on the cardholders statement. It is the Companys policy to continue to accrue interest and fee income on all credit card accounts beyond 90 days, except in limited circumstances, until the credit card account balance and all related interest and other fees are paid or charged off, typically at 180 days delinquent. When an account becomes delinquent, a message is printed on the credit cardholders billing statement requesting payment. After an account becomes 30 days past due, a proprietary collection scoring algorithm automatically scores the risk of the account becoming further delinquent. The collection system then recommends a collection strategy for the past due account based on the collection score and account balance and dictates the contact schedule and collections priority for the account. If the Company is unable to make a collection after exhausting all in-house collection efforts, the Company may engage collection agencies and outside attorneys to continue those efforts.
The following table presents the delinquency trends of the Companys credit card and loan receivables portfolio: December31, 2013 %of Total December31, 2012 %of Total (Inthousands,exceptpercentages) Receivables outstanding - principal $ 8,166,961 100.0 % $ 7,097,951 100.0 % Principal receivables balances contractually delinquent: 31 to 60 days 114,430 1.4 % 100,479 1.4 % 61 to 90 days 74,700 0.9 62,546 0.9 91 or more days 150,425 1.9 120,163 1.7 Total $ 339,555 4.2 % $ 283,188 4.0 % The practice of re-aging an account may affect credit card loan delinquencies and charge-offs. A re-age is intended to assist delinquent cardholders who have experienced financial difficulties but who demonstrate both an ability and willingness to repay the amounts due. Accounts meeting specific defined criteria are re-aged when the cardholder makes one or more consecutive payments aggregating a certain pre-defined amount of their account balance. With re-aging, the outstanding balance of a delinquent account is returned to a current status. For the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Companys re-aged accounts represented 1.4%, 1.3% and 1.9%, respectively, of total credit card and loan receivables for each period and thus do not have a significant impact on the Companys delinquencies or net charge-offs. The Companys re-aging practices comply with regulatory guidelines.
Modified Credit Card and Loan Receivables The Company holds certain credit card and loan receivables for which the terms have been modified. The Companys modified credit card and loan receivables include credit card and loan receivables for which temporary hardship concessions have been granted and credit card and loan receivables in permanent workout programs. These modified credit card and loan receivables include concessions consisting primarily of a reduced minimum payment and an interest rate reduction. The temporary programs concessions remain in place for a period no longer than twelve months, while the permanent programs remain in place through the payoff of the credit card and loan receivables if the credit cardholder complies with the terms of the program. These concessions do not include the forgiveness of unpaid principal, but may involve the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments. In the case of the temporary programs, at the end of the concession period, credit card and loan receivable terms revert to standard rates. These arrangements are automatically terminated if the customer fails to make payments in accordance with the terms of the program, at which time their account reverts back to its original terms.
Credit card and loan receivables for which temporary hardship and permanent concessions were granted are both considered troubled debt restructurings and are collectively evaluated for impairment. Modified credit card and loan receivables are evaluated at their present value with impairment measured as the difference between the credit card and loan receivable balance and the discounted present value of cash flows expected to be collected. Consistent with the Companys measurement of impairment of modified credit card and loan receivables on a pooled basis, the discount rate used for credit card and loan receivables is the average current annual percentage rate the Company applies to non-impaired credit card and loan receivables, which approximates what would have been applied to the pool of modified credit card and loan receivables prior to impairment. In assessing the appropriate allowance for loan loss, these modified credit card and loan receivables are included in the general pool of credit card and loan receivables with the allowance determined under the contingent loss model of ASC450-20, Loss Contingencies. If the Company applied accounting under ASC310-40, Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, to the modified credit card and loan receivables in these programs, there would not be a material difference in the allowance for loan loss.
The Company had $118.1 million and $117.0 million, respectively, as a recorded investment in impaired credit card and loan receivables with an associated allowance for loan loss of $33.9 million and $39.7 million, respectively, as of December31, 2013 and 2012. These modified credit card and loan receivables represented less than 3% of the Companys total credit card and loan receivables as of both December31, 2013 and 2012.
F-16 Index ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) The average recorded investment in the impaired credit card and loan receivables was $117.4 million and $114.6 million for the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Interest income on these modified credit card and loan receivables is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing credit card and loan receivables. Cash collections on these modified credit card and loan receivables are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to credit card and loan receivables that are not in such programs. The Company recognized $12.7 million, $15.5 million and $13.8 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, in interest income associated with modified credit card and loan receivables during the period that such credit card and loan receivables were impaired.
The following tables indicate the modifications related to troubled debt restructurings within credit card and loan receivables for the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012: Year Ended December31, 2013 Number of Restructurings Pre-modification Outstanding Balance Post- modification Outstanding Balance (Dollars in thousands) Troubled debt restructurings  credit card and loan receivables 147,200 $ 134,892 $ 134,799 Year Ended December31, 2012 Number of Restructurings Pre-modification Outstanding Balance Post- modification Outstanding Balance (Dollars in thousands) Troubled debt restructurings  credit card and loan receivables 134,187 $ 119,985 $ 119,856 The tables below summarize troubled debt restructurings that have defaulted during the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012 where the default occurred within 12 months of their modification date: Year Ended December31, 2013 Number of Restructurings Outstanding Balance (Dollars in thousands) Troubled debt restructurings that subsequently defaulted  credit card and loan receivables 63,590 $ 60,490 Year Ended December31, 2012 Number of Restructurings Outstanding Balance (Dollars in thousands) Troubled debt restructurings that subsequently defaulted  credit card and loan receivables 55,198 $ 53,806 F-17 Index ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) Age of Credit Card and Loan Receivable Accounts The following table sets forth, as of December31, 2013 and 2012, the number of active credit card and loan accounts with balances and the related principal balances outstanding, based upon the age of the active credit card and loan accounts from origination: December31, 2013 Age of Accounts Since Origination Number of Active Accounts with Balances Percentage of Active Accounts with Balances Principal Receivables Outstanding Percentage of Principal Receivables Outstanding (In thousands, except percentages) 0-12 Months 5,048 27.2 % $ 1,962,153 24.1 % 13-24 Months 2,550 13.7 1,072,648 13.1 25-36 Months 1,799 9.7 826,911 10.1 37-48 Months 1,318 7.1 622,766 7.6 49-60 Months 1,104 6.0 557,407 6.8 Over 60 Months 6,729 36.3 3,125,076 38.3 Total 18,548 100.0 % $ 8,166,961 100.0 % December31, 2012 Age of Accounts Since Origination Number of Active Accounts with Balances Percentage of Active Accounts with Balances Principal Receivables Outstanding Percentage of Principal Receivables Outstanding (In thousands, except percentages) 0-12 Months 4,287 25.1 % $ 1,545,955 21.8 % 13-24 Months 2,216 12.9 867,230 12.2 25-36 Months 1,580 9.2 676,362 9.5 37-48 Months 1,297 7.6 616,296 8.7 49-60 Months 1,053 6.2 502,217 7.1 Over 60 Months 6,681 39.0 2,889,891 40.7 Total 17,114 100.0 % $ 7,097,951 100.0 % Credit Quality The Company uses proprietary scoring models developed specifically for the purpose of monitoring the Companys obligor credit quality. The proprietary scoring models are used as a tool in the underwriting process and for making credit decisions. The proprietary scoring models are based on historical data and require various assumptions about future performance. Information regarding customer performance is factored into these proprietary scoring models to determine the probability of an account becoming 90 or more days past due at any time within the next 12 months. Obligor credit quality is monitored at least monthly during the life of an account. The following table reflects composition of the Companys credit card and loan receivables by obligor credit quality as of December31, 2013 and 2012: December31, 2013 December31, 2012 Probability of an Account Becoming 90 or More Days Past Due or Becoming Charged-off (within the next 12 months) Principal Receivables Outstanding Percentage of Principal Receivables Outstanding Principal Receivables Outstanding Percentage of Principal Receivables Outstanding (Inthousands,exceptpercentages) No Score $ 162,366 2.0 % $ 298,829 4.2 % 27.1% and higher 362,366 4.4 286,046 4.0 17.1% - 27.0% 732,425 9.0 613,184 8.7 12.6% - 17.0% 858,721 10.5 713,489 10.1 3.7% - 12.5% 3,234,547 39.6 2,840,964 40.0 1.9% - 3.6% 1,748,317 21.4 1,492,289 21.0 Lower than 1.9% 1,068,219 13.1 853,150 12.0 Total $ 8,166,961 100.0 % $ 7,097,951 100.0 % F-18 Index ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) Transfer of Financial Assets In August 2013, under agreements with subsidiaries of eBay, Inc., including PayPal, Inc. and Bill Me Later, Inc. (collectively, PayPal), the Company became an issuer for their Bill Me Later credit products. After origination, these loan receivables are sold to PayPal at par value plus accrued interest. These transfers qualify for sale treatment as they meet the conditions established in ASC 860-10, Transfers and Servicing. Following the sale, PayPal owns the loan receivables, bears the risk of loss in the event of loan defaults and is responsible for all servicing functions related to the amounts. The loan receivables originated by the Company that have not yet been sold to PayPal are included in loan receivables held for sale in the Companys consolidated balance sheets and carried at the lower of cost or fair value. The carrying value of these loan receivables approximates fair value due to the short duration between origination and sale. Purchases and sales of these loan receivables held for sale are reflected as operating activities in the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows.
Upon PayPals purchase of the originated loan receivables, the Company is obligated to purchase a participating interest in the pool of loan receivables generated in the Bill Me Later program. Such interest participates on a pro rata basis in the cash flows of the underlying pool of loan receivables, including principal repayments, finance charges, losses, recoveries, and servicing costs. The Company bears the risk of loss related to its participation interest in this pool. Through December31, 2013, the Company had purchased $80.1 million of these loan receivables, of which $61.6 million was outstanding at December31, 2013 and included in other credit card and loan receivables in the Companys consolidated balance sheets.
Portfolio Acquisitions During the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012, the Company acquired the following credit card portfolios:  December 2013  Gulf Credit Union, for a preliminary total purchase price of $9.6 million, which remains subject to customary purchase price adjustments and consists of $8.3 million of credit card receivables, $1.7 million of intangible assets, and $0.4 million assumed customer liabilities;  March 2013  Barneys New York, for a total purchase price of $37.1 million, which consisted of $35.3 million of credit card receivables and $1.8 million of intangible assets;  August2012  The Talbots, Inc., for a total purchase price of $163.3 million, which consisted of $133.4 million of credit card receivables and $29.9 million of intangible assets;  July2012  The Bon-Ton Stores, Inc., for a total purchase price of $494.7 million, which consisted of $444.9 million of credit card receivables and $49.8 million of intangible assets;  May2012  Premier Designs, Inc., for a total purchase price of $24.3 million, which consisted of $22.9 million of credit card receivables and $1.4 million of intangible assets; and  March2012  Pier 1 Imports, for a total purchase price of $97.7 million, which consisted of $96.2 million of credit card receivables and $1.5 million of intangible assets.
Securitized Credit Card Receivables The Company regularly securitizes its credit card receivables through its credit card securitization trusts, consisting of the WFN Trusts and the WFC Trust. The Company continues to own and service the accounts that generate credit card receivables held by the WFN Trusts and the WFC Trust. In its capacity as a servicer, each of the respective banks earns a fee from the WFN Trusts and the WFC Trust to service and administer the credit card receivables, collect payments and charge-off uncollectible receivables. These fees are eliminated and therefore are not reflected in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.
The WFN Trusts and the WFC Trust are VIEs and the assets of these consolidated VIEs include certain credit card receivables that are restricted to settle the obligations of those entities and are not expected to be available to the Company or its creditors. The liabilities of the consolidated VIEs include non-recourse secured borrowings and other liabilities for which creditors or beneficial interest holders do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company.
During the initial phase of a securitization reinvestment period, the Company generally retains principal collections in exchange for the transfer of additional credit card receivables into the securitized pool of assets. During the amortization or accumulation period of a securitization, the investors share of principal collections (in certain cases, up to a maximum specified amount each month) is either distributed to the investors or held in an account until it accumulates to the total amount due, at which time it is paid to the investors in a lump sum.
F-19 Index ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) The Company is required to maintain minimum interests ranging from 4% to 10% of the securitized credit card receivables. This requirement is met through sellers interest, which is eliminated in the consolidated balance sheets, and is supplemented through excess funding deposits. Excess funding deposits represent cash amounts deposited with the trustee of the securitizations.
Cash collateral, restricted deposits are generally released proportionately as investors are repaid, although some cash collateral, restricted deposits are released only when investors have been paid in full. None of the cash collateral, restricted deposits were required to be used to cover losses on securitized credit card receivables in the periods ending December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Market values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the securitys issuer, and the Companys intent to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities with low probabilities of default and has the ability to hold the investments until maturity. As of December31, 2013, the Company does not consider the investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.

The 2013 Credit Agreement contains the usual and customary negative covenants for transactions of this type, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the Companys ability and in certain instances, its subsidiaries ability to consolidate or merge; substantially change the nature of its business; sell, lease, or otherwise transfer any substantial part of its assets; create or incur indebtedness; create liens; pay dividends; and make acquisitions. The negative covenants are subject to certain exceptions as specified in the 2013 Credit Agreement.

Morgan Securities Inc., as agent to JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, London Branch, and Bank of America, N.A., affiliates of two of the initial purchasers (together, the 2013 Hedge Counterparties).

Prior to maturity, $32.5 million of Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 were surrendered for conversion and settled in cash. On August1, 2013, the Company settled in cash the remaining $772.6 million of Convertible Senior Notes due 2013, of which $772.5 million was surrendered for conversion for $1,790.3 million, with the remaining principal paid at maturity.

F-25 Index ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) Due 2014 In the second quarter of 2009, the Company issued $345.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2014. Holders of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 have the right to require the Company to repurchase for cash all or some of their Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes.
The Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 are governed by an indenture dated June2, 2009 between the Company and the Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. Pursuant to the indenture, the Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company, pay interest semi-annually in arrears at a rate of 4.75% per annum on May15 and November15 of each year beginning November15, 2009, will be convertible during certain periods and under certain circumstances and, subject to earlier repurchase by the Company or conversion, will mature on May15, 2014. The Company may not redeem the Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 prior to their maturity date.
Holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2014, in equal multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, under the following circumstances:  during any fiscal quarter (and only during such fiscal quarter) after the fiscal quarter ending December31, 2009, if the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is equal to or more than 130% of the conversion price of $47.57 of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 on the last day of such preceding fiscal quarter;  during the five business-day period after any five consecutive trading-day period, or the measurement period, in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 for each day of that measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sales price of the Companys common stock and the conversion rate of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 on each such day; or  upon the occurrence of certain specified corporate transactions.
In addition, holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 at their option at any time beginning on January13, 2014 and ending on the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, without regard to the foregoing circumstances.
The Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 have an initial conversion rate of 21.0235 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount, which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $47.57 per share. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Companys common stock or a combination thereof at the Companys election. The Company has elected to settle the principal amount (or the amount of the Companys conversion obligation, if less) of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 in cash upon conversion.
Through December 31, 2013, certain of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 were surrendered for conversion and, in each case, either have been or will be settled in cash following the completion of the applicable cash settlement averaging period. The amounts settled during 2013 were not material. The Company has elected to repay all conversions solely in cash.
Concurrently with the pricing of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 and the exercise of the over-allotment option, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its common stock with the following affiliates of three of the initial purchasers: J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as agent to JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, London Branch; Bank of America, N.A.; and Barclays Capital Inc., as agent for Barclays Bank PLC (together, the 2014 Hedge Counterparties), which cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 7.3 million shares of the Companys common stock at an initial strike price equal to the initial conversion price of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 (the 2014 Convertible Note Hedges).
Separately but also concurrently with the pricing of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 and the exercise of the over-allotment option, the Company entered into warrant transactions whereby it sold to the 2014 Hedge Counterparties warrants to acquire, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, up to approximately 7.3 million shares of its common stock at an initial strike price of approximately $70.54 (the 2014 Convertible Note Warrants). The 2014 Convertible Note Warrants will be exercisable and will expire in 79 equal tranches of 45,331 warrants and an 80th tranche of 45,405 warrants for one of the 2014 Hedge Counterparties and will be exercisable and will expire in 79 equal tranches of 22,665 warrants and an 80th tranche of either 22,741 or 22,743 warrants with respect to the remaining two 2014 Hedge Counterparties, beginning on August13, 2014 and continuing on each business day through December4, 2014 as to each of the 2014 Hedge Counterparties.
The cost of the 2014 Convertible Note Hedges, reduced by the proceeds to the Company from the sale of the 2014 Convertible Note Warrants, was approximately $50.7 million. The 2014 Convertible Note Hedges and 2014 Convertible Note Warrants are generally expected to offset the potential dilution of the Companys common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 to the extent that the Companys common stock price does not exceed $70.54 at the time of the exercise of the 2014 Convertible Note Warrants. The Company accounted for the 2014 Convertible Note Hedges and 2014 Convertible Note Warrants as equity instruments in accordance with the guidance in ASC815-40. Accordingly, the cost of the 2014 Convertible Note Hedges and the proceeds from the sale of the 2014 Convertible Note Warrants are included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets at December31, 2013.
F-26 Index ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) Concurrently with the pricing of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2014, the Company entered into prepaid forward transactions (the Prepaid Forwards) with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as agent for Merrill Lynch International, and Barclays Capital Inc., as agent for Barclays Bank PLC (collectively, the Forward Counterparties). Under the Prepaid Forwards, the Company purchased 1,857,400 shares of its common stock for approximately $74.9 million with proceeds from the offering. The shares are to be delivered over a settlement period in 2014. Each of the Prepaid Forwards is subject to early settlement, in whole or in part, at any time prior to the final settlement date at the option of the applicable Forward Counterparty, as well as early settlement or settlement with alternative consideration in the event of certain corporate transactions. In the event the Company pays any cash dividends on its common stock, the Forward Counterparties will pay an equivalent amount to the Company. The shares under the Prepaid Forwards were accounted for as a repurchase of common stock and a reduction of stockholders equity.

Non-Recourse Borrowings of Consolidated Securitization Entities An asset-backed security is a security whose value and income payments are derived from and collateralized (or backed) by a specified pool of underlying assets. The sale of the pool of underlying assets to general investors is accomplished through a securitization process. The Company regularly sells its credit card receivables to its credit card securitization trusts, the WFN Trusts and the WFC Trust, which are consolidated on the balance sheets of the Company under ASC860 and ASC810. The liabilities of the consolidated VIEs include asset-backed securities for which creditors or beneficial interest holders do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company.
Asset-Backed Term Notes In 2013, Master Trust I issued $1.2 billion of asset-backed term securities, $282.9 million of which was retained by the Company and eliminated from the consolidated financial statements. These securities have maturities of May 2016 and February 2018 and fixed interest rates of 0.91% and 1.61%. Proceeds from these issuances were used to repay the $822.3 million of asset-backed term securities that matured in 2013.
As of December31, 2013, $3.8 billion of asset-backed term securities were outstanding, $0.8 billion of which was retained by the Company and eliminated from the consolidated financial statements. These securities have varying maturities from October 2014 through June 2019 and fixed interest rates ranging from 0.91% to 6.75% as of December31, 2013.
In February 2014, Master Trust I issued $625.0 million of asset-backed term securities, $175.0 million of which was retained by the Company and eliminated from the consolidated financial statements. These securities mature in February 2016 and have a variable interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 0.38%.
Conduit Facilities The Company has access to committed undrawn capacity through three conduit facilities to support the funding of its credit card receivables through Master Trust I, Master Trust III and the WFC Trust. As of December31, 2013, total capacity under the conduit facilities was $2.1 billion, of which $1.6 billion had been drawn and was included in non-recourse borrowings of consolidated securitization entities in the consolidated balance sheets. Borrowings outstanding under each facility bear interest at a margin above LIBOR or the asset-backed commercial paper costs of each individual conduit provider. The conduits have varying maturities from March2014 to September2015 with variable interest rates ranging from 1.18% to 1.70% as of December31, 2013.
In February 2014, Master Trust I reduced its capacity under the conduit facility from $1.2 billion to $800.0 million.

Derivative Instruments As part of its interest rate risk management program, the Company may enter into derivative contracts with institutions that are established dealers to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for certain obligations.
The credit card securitization trusts entered into certain interest rate derivative instruments that involved the receipt of variable rate amounts from counterparties in exchange for the Company making fixed rate payments over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. These interest rate derivative instruments were not designated as hedges. Such instruments were not speculative and were used to manage interest rate risk, but did not meet the specific hedge accounting requirements of ASC815, Derivatives and Hedging.
The Companys outstanding interest rate derivative instruments matured in April 2013. The Company was not a party to any derivative instruments as of December31, 2013.
During the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, gains on derivative instruments of $8.5 million, $29.6 million and $31.7 million, respectively, were recognized in securitization funding costs within the consolidated statements of income.

DEFERRED REVENUE As further discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the AIR MILES Reward Program collects fees from its sponsors based on the number of AIR MILES reward miles issued and, in limited circumstances, the number of AIR MILES reward miles redeemed. Because management has determined that the earnings process is not complete at the time an AIR MILES reward mile is issued, the recognition of redemption and service revenue is deferred.
A reconciliation of deferred revenue for the AIR MILES Reward Program is as follows: Deferred Revenue Service Redemption Total (In thousands) December31, 2011 $ 358,973 $ 867,463 $ 1,226,436 Cash proceeds 216,772 570,439 787,211 Revenue recognized (205,740 ) (593,679 ) (799,419 ) Other  1,000 1,000 Effects of foreign currency translation 10,008 23,825 33,833 December31, 2012 380,013 869,048 1,249,061 Cash proceeds 203,735 528,474 732,209 Revenue recognized (212,301 ) (550,577 ) (762,878 ) Other  276 276 Effects of foreign currency translation (24,816 ) (56,666 ) (81,482 ) December31, 2013 $ 346,631 $ 790,555 $ 1,137,186 Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets: Current liabilities $ 175,883 $ 790,555 $ 966,438 Non-current liabilities $ 170,748 $  $ 170,748 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES AIR MILES Reward Program The Company has entered into contractual arrangements with certain AIR MILES Reward Program sponsors that result in fees being billed to those sponsors upon the redemption of AIR MILES reward miles issued by those sponsors. The Company has obtained letters of credit and other assurances from those sponsors for the Companys benefit that expire at various dates. These letters of credit and other assurances totaled $188.2 million at December31, 2013, which exceeds the amount of the Companys estimate of its obligation to provide travel and other rewards upon the redemption of the AIR MILES reward miles issued by those sponsors.
The Company currently has an obligation to provide AIR MILES Reward Program collectors with travel and other rewards upon the redemption of AIR MILES reward miles. The Company believes that the redemption settlements assets, including the letters of credit and other assurances mentioned above, are sufficient to meet that obligation.
The Company has entered into certain long-term arrangements to purchase tickets from airlines and other suppliers in connection with redemptions under the AIR MILES Reward Program. These long-term arrangements allow the Company to make purchases at set prices.
Leases The Company leases certain office facilities and equipment under noncancellable operating leases and is generally responsible for property taxes and insurance related to such facilities. Lease expense was $80.5 million, $71.5 million and $61.4 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Comenity Bank remains subject to regulation by the Board of the Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Companys industrial bank, Comenity Capital Bank, is authorized to do business by the State of Utah and the FDIC.
Quantitative measures established by regulations to ensure capital adequacy require Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets and of Tier1 capital to average assets as well as adequate allowances for loan losses. Under the regulations, a well capitalized institution must have a Tier1 capital ratio of at least 6%, a total capital ratio of at least 10% and a leverage ratio of at least 5% and not be subject to a capital directive order. An adequately capitalized institution must have a Tier1 capital ratio of at least 4%, a total capital ratio of at least 8% and a leverage ratio of at least 4%, but 3% is allowed in some cases. Under these guidelines, Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank are considered well capitalized. As of December31, 2013, Comenity Capital Banks Tier1 capital ratio was 14.1%, total capital ratio was 15.4% and leverage ratio was 14.0%, and Comenity Capital Bank was not subject to a capital directive order.

Cardholders The Companys Private Label Services and Credit segment is active in originating private label and co-branded credit cards in the United States. The Company reviews each potential customers credit application and evaluates the applicants financial history and ability and perceived willingness to repay. Credit card loans are made primarily on an unsecured basis. Cardholders reside throughout the United States and are not significantly concentrated in any one area.
Holders of credit cards issued by the Company have available lines of credit, which vary by cardholders that can be used for purchases of merchandise offered for sale by clients of the Company. These lines of credit represent elements of risk in excess of the amount recognized in the financial statements. The lines of credit are subject to change or cancellation by the Company. Excluding loans originated under the Companys agreements with PayPal, as of December31, 2013, the Company had approximately 39.3 million cardholders, having unused lines of credit averaging $1,434 per account.

Stock Compensation Plans The Company has adopted equity compensation plans to advance the interests of the Company by rewarding certain employees for their contributions to the financial success of the Company and thereby motivating them to continue to make such contributions in the future.
The 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan became effective July1, 2010 and expires on June30, 2015. This plan reserves 3,000,000 shares of common stock for grants of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share awards, cash incentive awards, deferred stock units, and other stock-based and cash-based awards to selected officers, employees, non-employee directors and consultants performing services for the Company or its affiliates, with only employees being eligible to receive incentive stock options.
Terms of all awards under the 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan are determined by the Board of Directors or the compensation committee of the Board of Directors or its designee at the time of award.
Stock Compensation Expense Under the fair value recognition provisions, stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized ratably over the requisite service period.
Total stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Companys consolidated statements of income for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, is as follows: Years Ended December31, 2013 2012 2011 (In thousands) Cost of operations $ 40,264 $ 32,654 $ 25,766 General and administrative 18,919 17,843 17,720 Total $ 59,183 $ 50,497 $ 43,486 As the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount recognized in the Companys results of operations has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. ASC718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on the Companys historical experience. The Companys forfeiture rate was 5% for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. As of December31, 2013, there was approximately $70.9 million of unrecognized expense, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, related to non-vested, stock-based equity awards granted to employees, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.2 years.
Restricted Stock Awards During 2013, the Company awarded both service-based and performance-based restricted stock units. Fair value of the restricted stock units is estimated using the Companys closing share price on the date of grant. In accordance with ASC718, the Company recognizes the estimated stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the applicable service period.
F-32 Index ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) Service-based restricted stock unit awards typically vest ratably over a three year period. Performance-based restricted stock unit awards typically vest ratably over a three year period if specified performance measures tied to the Companys financial performance are met.

The Company did not recognize stock-based compensation expense related to those awards no longer probable to vest. A total of 939,190 shares related to these certain performance-based restricted stock units did not meet the specified performance criteria and thus did not vest, resulting in their cancellation during the year ended December31, 2011.
The total fair value of restricted stock units vested was $50.4 million, $37.5 million and $45.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of restricted stock units outstanding and expected to vest was $232.6 million at December 31, 2013. The weighted-average remaining contractual life for unvested restricted stock units was 1.2 years at December31, 2013.
Stock Options Stock option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Companys stock on the date of grant. Options typically vest ratably over three years and expire ten years after the date of grant. No stock option awards were granted during the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. The fair value of the option awards was estimated on the date of grant using a binomial lattice model.

13. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Employee Stock Purchase Plan On June7, 2005, at the annual meeting of stockholders, the stockholders approved and adopted the Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP), effective on July1, 2005. No employee may purchase more than $25,000 in stock under the ESPP in any calendar year, and no employee may purchase stock under the ESPP if such purchase would cause the employee to own more than 5% of the voting power or value of the Companys common stock. The ESPP provides for three month offering periods, commencing on the first trading day of each calendar quarter and ending on the last trading day of each calendar quarter. The purchase price of the common stock upon exercise shall be 85% of the fair market value of shares on the applicable purchase date as determined by averaging the high and low trading prices of the last trading day of each quarter. An employee may elect to pay the purchase price of such common stock through payroll deductions. The maximum number of shares reserved for issuance under the ESPP is 1,500,000 shares, subject to adjustment as provided in the ESPP. Employees are required to hold any stock purchased through the ESPP for 180 days prior to any sale or withdrawal of shares.

F-34 Index ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan The Alliance Data Systems 401(k) and Retirement Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan that is qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Company amended its 401(k) and Retirement Savings Plan effective January 1, 2014. The 401(k) and Retirement Savings Plan is an IRS-approved safe harbor plan design that eliminates the need for most discrimination testing. Eligible employees can participate in the 401(k) and Retirement Savings Plan immediately upon joining the Company and after 180 days of employment begin receiving company matching contributions. In addition, seasonal or on-call employees must complete a year of eligibility service before they may participate in the 401(k) and Retirement Savings Plan. The 401(k) and Retirement Savings Plan permits eligible employees to make Roth elective deferrals, effective November1, 2012, which are included in the employees taxable income at the time of contribution, but not when distributed. Regular, or Non-Roth, elective deferrals made by employees, together with contributions by the Company to the 401(k) and Retirement Savings Plan, and income earned on these contributions, are not taxable to employees until withdrawn from the 401(k) and Retirement Savings Plan. The 401(k) and Retirement Savings Plan covers U.S. employees, who are at least 18 years old, of ADS Alliance Data Systems, Inc., one of the Companys wholly-owned subsidiaries, and any other subsidiary or affiliated organization that adopts this 401(k) and Retirement Savings Plan. The Company, and all of its U.S. subsidiaries, are currently covered under the 401(k) and Retirement Savings Plan.
Through December31, 2013, the Company matched dollar-for-dollar on the first three percent of savings, and an additional fifty cents for each dollar an employee contributed for savings of more than three percent and up to five percent of pay. Effective January1, 2014, the Company will match dollar-for-dollar up to five percent of savings. All company matching contributions are immediately vested. In addition to the company match, the Company may make an additional annual discretionary contribution based on the Companys profitability. This contribution, subject to Board of Director approval, is based on a percentage of pay and is subject to a separate three-year cliff vesting schedule. The discretionary contribution vests in full upon achieving three years of service for participants with less than three years of service. All of these contributions vest immediately if the participating employee has more than three years of service, attains age 65, becomes disabled, dies or if the 401(k) and Retirement Savings Plan terminates. Company matching and discretionary contributions for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $28.1 million, $22.0 million and $14.0 million, respectively.
The participants in the plan can direct their contributions and the Companys matching contribution to numerous investment options, including the Companys common stock. On July20, 2001, the Company registered 1,500,000 shares of its common stock for issuance in accordance with its 401(k) and Retirement Savings Plan pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-8, File No.333-65556.

The Deferred Profit Sharing Plan (DPSP) is a legal trust registered with the Canada Revenue Agency. Eligible full-time employees can participate in the GRSP after three months of employment and eligible part-time employees after six months of employment. Employees become eligible to receive company matching contributions into the DPSP on the first day of the calendar quarter following twelve months of employment. Based on the eligibility guidelines, the Company matches up to 5% of contributions dollar-for-dollar. Contributions made to the DPSP reduce an employees maximum contribution amounts to the GRSP under the Income Tax Act (Canada) for the following year. All company matching contributions into the DPSP vest after receipt of one continuous year of DPSP contributions. LoyaltyOne matching and discretionary contributions for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $2.1 million, $2.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively.
Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and the Canadian Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan The Company also maintains an Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (EDCP). The EDCP provides an opportunity for a defined group of management and highly compensated employees to defer on a pre-tax basis a portion of their regular compensation and bonuses payable for services rendered and to receive certain employer contributions.
The Company provides a Canadian Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for a defined group of management and highly compensated employees of Loyalty One, Inc., one of the Companys wholly-owned subsidiaries. Similar to the EDCP, participants may defer on a pre-tax basis a portion of their compensation and bonuses payable for services rendered and to receive certain employer contributions.

Pursuant to Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Companys utilization of such NOLs is subject to an annual limitation. In addition, at December31, 2013, the Company has state income tax NOLs of approximately $452.8 million, approximately $4.6 million of capital losses, and state credits of approximately $6.1 million available to offset future state taxable income. The state NOLs and credits will expire at various times through the year2033. The Company believes it is more likely than not that the capital losses and a portion of the state credits and state NOLs will expire before being utilized. Therefore, in accordance with ASC740-10, Income TaxesOverallInitial Measurement, the Company has established a valuation allowance on the portion of state credits and state NOLs that the Company expects to expire prior to utilization.
Should certain substantial changes in the Companys ownership occur, there could be an annual limitation on the amount of carryovers and credits that can be utilized. The impact of such a limitation would likely not be significant.
The income tax expense does not reflect the tax effect of certain items recorded directly to additional paid-in capital. The net tax impact resulting from the exercise of employee stock options and other employee stock programs that was recorded in additional paid-in capital was approximately $17.3 million, $21.4 million and $17.3 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
F-37 Index ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) In December2009, the Ontario government enacted a law to reduce the corporate income tax rates for years beginning in 2010. As a result of these rate reductions, the Company was required to book additional expense to reduce the net deferred tax asset in Canada related to the future lower income tax rates. The Company recorded $7.2 million of income tax expense for the year ended December31, 2011 related to these rate reductions. In June2012, the Ontario government enacted a law that froze the corporate income tax rate at the current rate, essentially repealing the rate reductions scheduled for future years. As a result of the rate freeze, the Company was required to record a $7.1 million tax benefit to increase its deferred tax asset in Canada related to future years.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands): Balance at December31, 2010 $ 54,200 Increases related to prior years tax positions 14,509 Decreases related to prior years tax positions (5,497 ) Increases related to current year tax positions 9,581 Settlements during the period (2,569 ) Lapses of applicable statutes of limitation (680 ) Balance at December31, 2011 $ 69,544 Increases related to prior years tax positions 4,188 Decreases related to prior years tax positions (7,424 ) Increases related to current year tax positions 11,703 Settlements during the period (1,253 ) Lapses of applicable statutes of limitation (604 ) Balance at December31, 2012 $ 76,154 Increases related to prior years tax positions 4,328 Decreases related to prior years tax positions (1,580 ) Increases related to current year tax positions 23,567 Settlements during the period (197 ) Lapses of applicable statutes of limitation (918 ) Balance at December31, 2013 $ 101,354 Included in the balance at December31, 2013 are tax positions reclassified from deferred tax liabilities. Deductibility or taxability is highly certain for these tax positions but there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility or taxability. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, this timing uncertainty would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period.
The Company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company has potential cumulative interest and penalties with respect to unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $18.5 million, $15.5 million and $15.1 million at December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. For the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012, the Company recorded approximately $2.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, in potential interest and penalties with respect to unrecognized tax benefits. For the year ended December31, 2011, the Company released approximately $0.3 million in potential interest and penalties with respect to unrecognized tax benefits.
At December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $56.0 million, $37.5 million and $37.1 million, respectively that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The Company does not anticipate a significant change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. With some exceptions, the tax returns filed by the Company are no longer subject to state and local or foreign income tax examinations for years before 2009 and are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2010.
16. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS In accordance with ASC825, Financial Instruments, the Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practical to estimate fair value. To obtain fair values, observable market prices are used if available. In some instances, observable market prices are not readily available and fair value is determined using present value or other techniques appropriate for a particular financial instrument. These techniques involve judgment and as a result are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions or estimation techniques may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
F-38 Index ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) Fair Value of Financial Instruments The estimated fair values of the Companys financial instruments are as follows: December31, 2013 2012 Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value (In thousands) Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 969,822 $ 969,822 $ 893,352 $ 893,352 Trade receivables, net 394,822 394,822 370,110 370,110 Credit card and loan receivables, net 8,131,795 8,131,795 6,967,674 6,967,674 Redemption settlement assets, restricted 510,349 510,349 492,690 492,690 Cash collateral, restricted 34,124 34,124 65,160 65,160 Other investments 99,221 99,221 91,972 91,972 Derivative instruments   4 4 Financial liabilities Accounts payable 210,019 210,019 215,470 215,470 Deposits 2,816,361 2,836,352 2,228,411 2,255,089 Non-recourse borrowings of consolidated securitization entities 4,591,916 4,618,205 4,130,970 4,225,745 Long-term and other debt 2,800,281 4,404,500 2,854,839 4,358,379 Derivative instruments   8,515 8,515 Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities Held at December31, 2013 and 2012 The following techniques and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair values of financial instruments as disclosed herein: Cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, net and accounts payable  The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short maturity and the relatively liquid nature of these assets and liabilities.
Credit card and loan receivables, net Credit card and loan receivables, net includes both receivables issued or purchased by the Company in the normal course of business and loan receivables held for sale as described in Note 4, Credit Card and Loan Receivables. The carrying amount of credit card and loan receivables, net approximates fair value due to the short maturity and average interest rates that approximate current market origination rates. Loan receivables held for sale, which were $62.1 million at December31, 2013, are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, and their carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short duration between origination and sale.
Redemption settlement assets, restricted Redemption settlement assets, restricted consists of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. The fair value for securities is based on quoted market prices for the same or similar securities.
Cash collateral, restricted The spread deposits are recorded at their fair value based on discounted cash flow models. The Company uses a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated cash flows for each asset. The fair value is based on the term of the underlying securities and a discount rate. The carrying amount of excess funding deposits approximates its fair value due to the relatively short maturity period and average interest rates, which approximate current market rates.
Other investments Other investments consist of restricted cash and marketable securities. The fair value is based on quoted market prices for the same or similar securities.
Deposits The fair value is estimated based on the current observable market rates available to the Company for similar deposits with similar remaining maturities.
Non-recourse borrowings of consolidated securitization entities The fair value is estimated based on the current observable market rates available to the Company for similar debt instruments with similar remaining maturities or quoted market prices for the same transaction.
Long-term and other debt The fair value is estimated based on the current observable market rates available to the Company for similar debt instruments with similar remaining maturities or quoted market prices for the same transaction.
Derivative instruments The valuation of these instruments was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflected the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and used observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and option volatility.
F-39 Index ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) Other Investments Other investments consist of restricted cash and marketable securities. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, other investments are comprised as follows: December31,2013 December31,2012 Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Fair Value Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Fair Value (In thousands) Restricted cash $ 25,988 $  $  $ 25,988 $ 47,120 $  $  $ 47,120 Marketable securities 77,351 62 (4,180 ) 73,233 45,119 202 (469 ) 44,852 Total $ 103,339 $ 62 $ (4,180 ) $ 99,221 $ 92,239 $ 202 $ (469 ) $ 91,972 The following tables show the gross unrealized losses and fair value for those investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of December31, 2013 and 2012, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position: December 31, 2013 Lessthan12months 12MonthsorGreater Total FairValue Unrealized Losses FairValue Unrealized Losses FairValue Unrealized Losses (In thousands) Marketable securities $ 39,954 $ (2,206 ) $ 25,785 $ (1,974 ) $ 65,739 $ (4,180 ) December 31, 2012 Lessthan12months 12MonthsorGreater Total FairValue Unrealized Losses FairValue Unrealized Losses FairValue Unrealized Losses (In thousands) Marketable securities $ 28,886 $ (292 ) $ 4,913 $ (177 ) $ 33,799 $ (469 ) The amortized cost and estimated fair value of the marketable securities at December31, 2013 by contractual maturity are as follows: Amortized Cost Estimated FairValue (Inthousands) Due in one year or less $ 6,571 $ 6,503 Due after five years through ten years 4,580 4,611 Due after ten years 66,200 62,119 Total $ 77,351 $ 73,233 Market values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the securitys issuer, and the Companys intent to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities with low probabilities of default and has the ability to hold the investments until maturity. Realized gains and losses from the sale of investment securities were not material.
As of December31, 2013, the Company does not consider the investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.
F-40 Index ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Fair Value Hierarchy ASC825 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include:  Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;  Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and  Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs where little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
Financial instruments are considered Level 3 when their values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. Level 3 financial instruments also include those for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. The use of different techniques to determine fair value of these financial instruments could result in different estimates of fair value at the reporting date.
The following table provides information for the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December31, 2013 and 2012: FairValueMeasurementsat December31,2013Using Balanceat December31, 2013 Level1 Level2 Level3 (In thousands) Corporate bonds (1) $ 436,365 $  $ 436,365 $  Cash collateral, restricted 34,124   34,124 Other investments (2) 99,221 30,888 68,333  Total assets measured at fair value $ 569,710 $ 30,888 $ 504,698 $ 34,124 FairValueMeasurementsat December31,2012Using Balanceat December31, 2012 Level1 Level2 Level3 (In thousands) Government bonds (1) $ 5,117 $  $ 5,117 $  Corporate bonds (1) 447,307 6,165 441,142  Cash collateral, restricted 65,160 2,500  62,660 Other investments (2) 91,972 51,951 40,021  Derivative instruments (3) 4  4  Total assets measured at fair value $ 609,560 $ 60,616 $ 486,284 $ 62,660 Derivative instruments (4) $ 8,515 $  $ 8,515 $  Total liabilities measured at fair value $ 8,515 $  $ 8,515 $  (1) Amounts are included in redemption settlement assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

The spread deposits included in cash collateral, restricted are recorded at their fair value based on discounted cash flow models, utilizing the respective term of each instrument which ranged from 10 to 34 months, with a weighted average term of 17 months. The unobservable input used to calculate the fair value was the discount rate of 3.2%, which was based on an interest rate curve that is observable in the market as adjusted for a credit spread. Significant increases (decreases) in the term or the discount rate would result in a lower (higher) fair value.
