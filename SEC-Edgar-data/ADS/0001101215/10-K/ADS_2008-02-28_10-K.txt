Such statements may use words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, predict, project, and similar expressions as they relate to us or our management. When we make forward-looking statements, we are basing them on our managements beliefs and assumptions, using information currently available to us. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those discussed in the Risk Factors section in Item1A of this Form 10-K and elsewhere in this Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K.
If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary materially from what we projected. Any forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to these and other risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our operations, results of operations, growth strategy and liquidity.

The Company cannot provide any assurance that the conditions to closing the proposed merger will be satisfied or that the transactions will be completed.

1 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements PART I Item1.
Business Agreement and Plan of Merger On May17, 2007, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Aladdin Solutions, Inc. (f/k/a Aladdin Holdco, Inc., Parent), Aladdin Merger Sub, Inc. (Merger Sub) and the Company (the Merger Agreement). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, and as a result the Company will continue as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the Merger). Parent and Merger Sub were formed and are controlled by affiliates of The Blackstone Group. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock of the Company, other than shares owned by the Company, Parent, any subsidiary of the Company or Parent, or by any stockholders who are entitled to and who properly exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $81.75 in cash, without interest. In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that the vesting and/or lapse of restrictions on substantially all stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units will be accelerated at the effective time of the Merger and holders of such securities will receive consideration in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. The Company will also accelerate the recognition of stock compensation expense resulting from the vesting of substantially all outstanding unvested stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units in connection with the Merger. Consummation of the Merger is subject to closing conditions, including conditions relating to regulatory approvals. No assurances can be given that the conditions precedent to consummating the Merger will be satisfied or that the Merger will be consummated.
We filed our definitive proxy statement and proxy supplement with the SEC on July5, 2007 and July30, 2007, respectively, soliciting stockholder approval of the Merger Agreement, which was approved at a special meeting of our stockholders on August8, 2007. We filed our Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, notification and report forms with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice on June1, 2007 and early termination of the applicable waiting period was granted on June11, 2007. We filed a request for an advance ruling certificate (ARC) regarding the Merger under the Competition Act (Canada) with the Canadian Commissioner of Competition on June1, 2007 and received an ARC on June7, 2007. We filed a notification under the German Act against Restraints of Competition, as amended with the German Federal Cartel Office on June14, 2007. The waiting period under the German Competition Act expired on July14, 2007. Parent filed the required notices with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on June28, 2007. Parent also filed the required notices with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions, in each case on July2, 2007.
On January25, 2008, Parent informed us in a written notice that it does not anticipate the condition to closing the Merger relating to obtaining approvals from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will be satisfied.
On January30, 2008, we filed a lawsuit against Parent and Merger Sub (together, the Merger Entities). The lawsuit, filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, sought specific performance to compel the Merger Entities to comply with their obligations under the Merger Agreement, including their covenants to use reasonable best efforts to obtain required regulatory approvals and to consummate the Merger.
On February8, 2008, we filed a motion to dismiss our lawsuit without prejudice in response to the Merger Entities confirmation of their commitment to work to consummate the Merger. We are working with the Merger Entities to effect an acceptable solution to the unresolved regulatory issues. There can be no assurance, however, that an acceptable solution will be obtained or that the Merger will be completed.
2 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our Company We are a leading provider of data-driven and transaction-based marketing and customer loyalty solutions. We offer a comprehensive portfolio of integrated outsourced marketing solutions, including customer loyalty programs, database marketing services, marketing strategy consulting, analytics and creative services, permission-based email marketing and private label retail credit card programs. We focus on facilitating and managing interactions between our clients and their customers through a variety of consumer marketing channels, including in-store, catalog, mail, telephone and on-line. We capture data created during each customer interaction, analyze the data and leverage the insight derived from that data to enable clients to identify and acquire new customers, as well as to enhance customer loyalty. We believe that our services are becoming increasingly valuable as companies continue to shift their marketing resources away from traditional mass marketing campaigns toward more targeted marketing programs that provide measurable returns on marketing investments.
Our clients are primarily large consumer-based businesses and include such well-known brands in North America as BMO Bank of Montreal, Citibank, Hilton, Bank of America, Victorias Secret, Canada Safeway, Shell Canada, Amex Bank of Canada, J. Crew and Expedia. Our client base of more than 800 companies is diversified across a broad range of end-markets, including, among others, financial services, specialty retail, grocery and drugstore chains, petroleum retail, technology, hospitality and travel, media and pharmaceuticals. We believe our comprehensive suite of marketing solutions offers us a significant competitive advantage, as many of our competitors offer a more limited range of services. We believe the breadth and quality of our service offerings have led to long-standing client relationships.
We are the result of the 1996 merger of two entities acquired by Welsh, Carson, Anderson& Stowe: J.C. Penneys transaction services business, BSI Business Services, Inc., and Limited Brands, Inc.s credit card bank operation, World Financial Network National Bank. In June 2001, we concluded the initial public offering of our common stock, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. During 2003, we completed two secondary public offerings whereby Limited Commerce Corp., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Limited Brands and was our second largest stockholder, sold all of our shares of common stock it beneficially owned. During 2006, Welsh, Carson, Anderson& Stowe completed the distribution of its shares to its limited partners.
We continue to execute on our growth strategy through internal growth and acquisitions. In 2007, we entered into new arrangements for private label retail card services with Orchard Supply Hardware and Gardner-White. We also signed Labrador Liquor Corporation, Roins Financial Services Limited, Rno-Dpot and Vision Electronics as new sponsors in the AIR MILES  Reward Program. We signed new contracts with Tesco, EachNet, Charter Communications, and Helzberg Diamond to provide integrated email and marketing solutions. We also signed a multi-year agreement with 7-Eleven, Inc. to provide payment processing services, including authorization and settlement for debit and credit transactions, and prepaid card services.
We further expanded our relationships with several key clients, including the signing of a multi-year agreement with Redcats USA to provide integrated credit and marketing services, including co-branded credit card services to supplement Redcats USAs existing private label card program and co-branded credit card services to The Sportsmans Guide, a new client of Redcats USA. We also entered into an agreement with Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (to launch a private label retail card program for the West Elm brand) and continue providing private label retail card services for the Pottery Barn brands. We also expanded our co-branded credit card services with Fortunoff.
We also completed significant AIR MILES Reward Program sponsor renewals in 2007 with A&P Canada, Goodyear Canada, Forzani Group, Ltd. and Katz Group Canadas Rexall and Pharma Plus pharmacies. We also renewed contracts with Alon USA for integrated private label card services and Truckee Meadows Water Authority to provide customer care solutions as well as to provide bill print and payment solutions.
3 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In February 2007, we continued to expand our marketing services offering with the acquisition of Abacus, formerly a division of DoubleClick Inc., and a leading provider of data and multi-channel direct marketing services. In November 2007, we sold our Mail Services business. The sale allows us to increase our focus on the capabilities, technologies and businesses that more closely align with our strategy.
Our corporate headquarters is located at 17655 Waterview Parkway, Dallas, Texas 75252, and our telephone number is 972-348-5100.
Our Market Opportunity and Growth Strategy We intend to enhance our position as a leading provider of targeted, data-driven and transaction-based marketing and loyalty solutions and to continue our growth in revenue and earnings by pursuing the following strategies:  Capitalize on our Leadership in Targeted and Data-Driven Consumer Marketing .
We intend to continue to capitalize on the ongoing shift away from traditional mass marketing campaigns to targeted and data-driven marketing programs with measurable return on investment. As consumer companies initiate or expand their targeted and transaction-based marketing strategies, we believe we are well-positioned to acquire new clients and sell additional services to existing clients based on our extensive experience in capturing and analyzing our clients customer transaction data to develop targeted marketing programs. We believe our comprehensive portfolio of high-quality targeted marketing and loyalty solutions provides a competitive advantage over peers with more limited service offerings. We seek to extend our leadership position in the transaction-based and targeted marketing services sector by continuing to improve the breadth and quality of our products and services. We also intend to enhance our leadership position in loyalty programs by expanding the scope of the AIR MILES Reward Program and by continuing to develop stand-alone loyalty programs such as the Hilton HHonors Program and the Citi Thank You Network . We believe that building on our market leadership will enable us to benefit from the anticipated growth in demand for targeted marketing strategies.
Sell More Fully Integrated End-to-End Marketing Solutions.
In our U.S. marketing business (Epsilon), we have assembled what we believe is the industrys most comprehensive suite of targeted and data-driven marketing services, including marketing strategy consulting, data services, database development and management, marketing analytics, creative design and delivery services such as email communications. As a result of our acquisition of Abacus in February 2007, we are able to offer an end-to-end solution to clients, providing a significant opportunity to expand our relationships with existing clients, the majority of which do not currently purchase the full suite of services we offer. In addition, we further intend to integrate our product and service offerings across our business units so that we can provide clients in a broad range of industries with a comprehensive portfolio of targeted marketing solutions, including both coalition and individual loyalty programs, private label retail card programs and other transaction-based marketing solutions. By selling integrated solutions within and across our business units and our entire client base, we have a significant opportunity to maximize the value of our long-standing client relationships.
Continue to Expand our Global Footprint.
We plan to grow our business by leveraging our core competencies in the North American marketplace to further penetrate international markets. Global reach is increasingly important as our clients grow into new markets, and we are well positioned to cost-effectively increase our global presence. We believe international expansion will provide us with strong revenue growth opportunities.
Optimize our Business Portfolio.
We will continue to evaluate our products and services given our strategic direction and demand trends. While we are focused on realizing organic revenue growth and margin expansion, we will consider select acquisitions of complementary businesses that would enhance our product portfolio, market positioning or geographic presence. We have a strong track record of identifying and integrating such targeted acquisitions.
4 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Products and Services Our products and services are reported under three segmentsMarketing Services, Credit Services, and Transaction Services. We have traditionally marketed and sold our products and services on a stand-alone basis but increasingly market and sell them on an integrated basis. Our products and services are listed below. Financial information about our segments and geographic areas appears in Note 21 of our consolidated financial statements.
Segment Products and Services Marketing Services Loyalty Programs Coalition loyalty Stand alone loyalty Marketing Services Analytical services Strategic consulting and creative services Proprietary data services Database marketing services Interactive communications Credit Services Private Label Receivables Financing Underwriting and risk management Receivables funding Transaction Services Processing Services New account processing Billing and payment processing Remittance processing Customer care Utility Services Customer information system hosting Billing and payment processing Customer care Merchant Services Point-of-Sale Services Merchant bankcard services Marketing Services Our clients are focused on targeting, acquiring and retaining loyal and profitable customers. We create and manage targeted marketing programs that result in securing more frequent and sustained customer behavior. We utilize the information gathered through our loyalty and targeted marketing programs to help our clients design and implement effective marketing programs. Our clients within this segment include financial services providers, supermarkets, petroleum retailers, specialty retailers and pharmaceutical companies. BMO Bank of Montreal, the largest Marketing Services client in 2007, represented approximately 21.5% of this segments 2007 revenue.
Coalition Loyalty.
Our AIR MILES Reward Program is the largest coalition loyalty program in Canada with over 120 participating sponsors participating in the program. The AIR MILES Reward Program enables consumers to earn AIR MILES reward miles, which operate as points, as they shop within a range of retailers and other sponsors participating in the AIR MILES Reward Program. We believe that one of the reasons our AIR MILES Reward Program is so popular with consumers, as evidenced by the approximately 70% participation rate 5 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements for Canadian households, is that consumers are able to rapidly accumulate AIR MILES reward miles across a significant portion of their everyday spending.
We deal with three primary parties in connection with our AIR MILES Reward Program: sponsors, collectors and suppliers.
Sponsors . Our AIR MILES Reward Program has more than 120 brand name sponsors participating in the program such as Canada Safeway, Shell Canada, Jean Coutu, Amex Bank of Canada and BMO Bank of Montreal. The AIR MILES Reward Program is a full service outsourced loyalty program for our sponsors, who pay us a fee per AIR MILES reward mile issued, for which we provide all marketing, customer service and rewards and redemption management. We typically grant participating sponsors exclusivity in their category, which allows them to realize incremental sales and increase their market share as a result of their participation in the AIR MILES Reward Program coalition.
Collectors . Consumers participating in the AIR MILES Reward Program, who we refer to as collectors, earn AIR MILES reward miles at over 10,000 retail and service locations, in addition to the many locations where collectors can use certain cards issued by BMO Bank of Montreal and Amex Bank of Canada. The AIR MILES Reward Program offers a reward structure that provides a quick, easy and free way for collectors to earn a broad selection of travel, entertainment and other lifestyle rewards by shopping at participating sponsors.
Suppliers . We enter into supply agreements with suppliers of rewards to the program such as airlines, movie theaters and manufacturers of consumer electronics. We obtain rewards from over 300 suppliers who utilize the AIR MILES Reward Program as an additional distribution channel for their products. Suppliers include such well-recognized companies as Apple, Starbucks, Sony and Air Canada.
U.S Marketing Services.
Our Epsilon business is a leader in providing integrated direct marketing solutions that combine database marketing technology and analytics with a broad range of direct marketing services. We offer customer management and loyalty solutions by utilizing data, database technologies, analytics and delivery platforms to maximize the value and loyalty of our clients customers and assist our clients in acquiring new customers. Our marketing programs target and reach individual consumers and provide a measurable return on our clients marketing investments. As a result of our acquisition of Abacus, in February 2007, we have become the industry leader in providing customer acquisition and retention solutions through cooperative databases that contain consumer transactional data from more than 1,500 multi-channel catalogers, retailers, on-line merchants and business-to-business marketers. We also operate what we believe is the worlds largest permission-based email marketing platform. We offer our clients a full end-to-end solution, including marketing strategy consulting, data services, database development and management, marketing analytics, creative design and delivery services such as email communications, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage over other marketing services providers with more limited service offerings. Epsilon has over 500 clients, primarily in the financial services, specialty retail, hospitality and pharmaceutical end-markets.
Analytical Services.
We provide behavior-based, demographic and attitudinal segmentation; acquisition, attrition, cross-sell and up-sell, retention, loyalty and value predictive modeling; and program evaluation, testing and measurement across our integrated marketing services.
Strategic Consulting and Creative.
We provide consulting services that analyze our clients business, brand and/or product strategy to create customer campaigns and sales channel strategies and tactics designed to further optimize our clients customer relationships and marketing return on investment. We also provide direct marketing program design, development and management; campaign design and execution; value proposition and business case development; concept development and creative media consulting; print, imaging and personalization services; data processing services; fulfillment services; and mailing services.
6 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Proprietary Data Services.
We provide various data services that are essential to making informed marketing decisions. Together with our clients, we utilize this data to develop highly targeted, individualized marketing programs that build stronger customer relationships and increase response rates in marketing programs.
Marketing Database Services.
We provide design and management of outsourced loyalty programs, integrated marketing databases; customer and prospect data integration and data hygiene; campaign management and marketing application integration; and web design and development.
Interactive Communications.
We provide strategic, permission-based email communication solutions and marketing technologies. Our end-to-end suite of industry specific products and services includes scalable email campaign technology, delivery optimization, marketing automation tools, turnkey integration solutions, strategic consulting and creative expertise to produce email programs that generate measurable results throughout the customer lifecycle.
Credit Services Our Credit Services segment provides risk management solutions, account origination and funding services for our more than 85 private label retail card programs. Through these programs, we managed approximately $3.9 billion in average receivables from approximately 23million active accounts for the year ended December31, 2007, with an average balance during that period of approximately $360 for accounts with outstanding balances. We process millions of credit applications each year using automated proprietary scoring technology and verification procedures to make risk-based origination decisions when approving new cardholders and establishing their credit limits. These procedures help us segment prospects into narrower ranges within each risk score provided by credit bureaus, allowing us to better evaluate individual credit risk and tailor our risk-based pricing accordingly. Our cardholders tend to be middle- to upper-income individuals, in particular 35 to 49 year-old married females who use our cards primarily as brand affinity tools rather than pure financing instruments, which has resulted in lower average balances than on general purpose credit cards. We focus our sales efforts on prime borrowers and do not target sub-prime borrowers.
We utilize a securitization program as our primary funding vehicle for private label retail card receivables. Securitizations involve the packaging and selling of both current and future receivable balances of credit card accounts to a special purpose entity that then sells them to a master trust. Our securitizations are treated as sales for accounting purposes and, accordingly, the receivables are removed from our balance sheet. We retain an ownership interest in the receivables, which is commonly referred to as a sellers interest, and a residual interest in the trust, which is commonly referred to as an interest-only strip. As of December31 2007, Intimate Brands and Redcats accounted for approximately 18.9% and 14.0%, respectively, of the receivables in the trust portfolio.
Transaction Services We facilitate and manage transactions between our clients and their customers through our scalable processing systems.
Processing Services.
We assist clients in extending their brand with a private label or co-branded credit card that can be used by customers at the clients store locations, catalogs or on-line. We provide service and maintenance to our clients private label credit and co-branded card programs and assist our clients in acquiring, retaining and managing valuable repeat customers. Our Transaction Services segment performs processing services for our Credit Services segment in connection with that segments private label credit card and co-branded programs. These inter-segment services accounted for 47.4% of Transaction Services revenue in 2007. We have developed a proprietary private label credit card system designed specifically for retailers that has 7 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the flexibility to be customized to accommodate our clients specific needs. We have also built into the system marketing tools to assist our clients in increasing sales. We utilize our Quick Credit and On-Line Prescreen products to originate new private label credit card accounts. We believe that these products provide an effective marketing advantage over competing services.
We use automated technology for bill preparation, printing and mailing, as well as offer consumers the ability to view, print and pay their bills on-line. By doing so, we improve the funds availability for both our clients and for those private label credit card receivables that we own or securitize. Our customer care operations are influenced by our retail heritage. We focus our training programs in all areas to achieve the highest possible standards. We monitor our performance by conducting surveys with our clients and their customers. Our call centers are equipped to handle phone, mail, fax and on-line inquiries. We also provide collection activities on delinquent accounts to support our retail private label credit card programs.
Utility Services.
We believe that we are one of the largest independent service providers of customer information systems for utilities in North America. We provide a comprehensive single source business solution for customer care and billing solutions. We have solutions for the regulated, de-regulated and municipal marketplace. These solutions provide not only hosting of the customer information system, but also customer care, statement generation and payment processing. We focus on the successful acquisition, value enhancement and retention of our clients customers.
In both a regulated and de-regulated environment, providers will need more sophisticated and complex billing and customer information systems to effectively compete in the marketplace. We believe that our ability to integrate transaction and marketing services effectively provides a competitive advantage for us.
Merchant Services.
We are a provider of transaction processing services with an emphasis on the U.S. petroleum retail industry. We have built a network that enables us to process virtually all electronic payment types including credit card, debit card, prepaid card, gift card, electronic benefits and check transactions.
Safeguards to Our Business; Disaster and Contingency Planning We operate multiple data processing centers to process and store our customer transaction data. Given the significant amount of data that we manage, much of which is real-time data to support our clients commerce initiatives, we have established redundant capabilities for our data centers. We have a number of safeguards in place that are designed to protect our company from data related risks and in the event of a disaster, to restore our data centers systems.
Protection of Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights We rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other similar measures to protect our proprietary information and technology used in each business unit of our business. We currently have seven patent applications pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and two international applications. We generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate partners, and generally control access to and distribution of our technology, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite the efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain the use of our products or technology that we consider proprietary and third parties may attempt to develop similar technology independently. We pursue registration and protection of our trademarks primarily in the United States and Canada, although we also have either registered trademarks or applications pending in Argentina, New Zealand, the European Union, Peru, Venezuela, Brazil, Great Britain, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore.
Effective protection of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in some countries. The laws of some countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the United States and Canada. We are the exclusive Canadian licensee of the AIR MILES family of trademarks pursuant to a perpetual 8 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements license agreement with Air Miles International Trading B.V., for which we pay a royalty fee. We believe that the AIR MILES family of trademarks and our other trademarks are important for our branding, corporate identification and marketing of our services in each business unit.
Competition The markets for our products and services are highly competitive. We compete with marketing services companies, credit card issuers, and data processing companies, as well as with the in-house staffs of our current and potential clients.
Marketing Services.
As a provider of marketing services, we generally compete with advertising and other promotional and loyalty programs, both traditional and on-line, for a portion of a clients total marketing budget. In addition, we compete against internally developed products and services created by our existing and potential clients. For each of our marketing services, we expect competition to intensify as more competitors enter our market. Competitors with our AIR MILES Reward Program may target our sponsors and collectors as well as draw rewards from our rewards suppliers. Our ability to generate significant revenue from clients and loyalty partners will depend on our ability to differentiate ourselves through the products and services we provide and the attractiveness of our loyalty and rewards programs to consumers. The continued attractiveness of our loyalty and rewards programs will also depend on our ability to remain affiliated with sponsors that are desirable to consumers and to offer rewards that are both attainable and attractive to consumers. Intensifying competition may make it more difficult for us to do this.
Our Epsilon business generally competes with advertising and other promotional programs, both traditional and on-line. In addition, Epsilon competes against internally developed products and services created by our existing clients and others. For each of our marketing services, we expect competition to intensify as more competitors enter our market. For our targeted direct marketing services offerings, our ability to continue to capture detailed customer transaction data is critical in providing effective customer relationship management strategies for our clients. Our ability to differentiate the mix of products and services that we offer, together with the effective delivery of those products and services, are also important factors in meeting our clients objective to continually improve their return on marketing investment.
Credit Services.
Our credit services business competes primarily with financial institutions whose marketing focus has been on developing credit card programs with large revolving balances. These competitors further drive their businesses by cross selling their other financial products to their cardholders. Our focus has primarily been on targeting specialty retailers that understand the competitive advantage of developing loyal customers. Typically these retailers have customers that make more frequent and smaller transactions. As a result, we are able to analyze card-based transaction data we obtain through managing our card programs, including customer specific transaction data and overall consumer spending patterns, to develop and implement targeted marketing strategies and to develop successful customer relationship management strategies for our clients. As an issuer of private label retail cards, we compete with other payment methods, primarily general purpose credit cards like Visa and MasterCard, which we also issue primarily as co-branded private label retail cards, American Express and Discover Card, as well as cash, checks and debit cards.
Transaction Services.
Our focus has been on industry segments characterized by companies with large customer bases, detail-rich data and high transaction volumes. Targeting these specific market sectors allows us to develop and deliver solutions that meet the needs of these sectors. This focus is consistent with our marketing strategy for all products and services. Additionally, we believe we effectively distinguish ourselves from other transaction processors by providing solutions that help our clients leverage investments they have made in payment systems by using these systems for electronic marketing programs. Competition in the area of utility services comes primarily from larger, more well-funded and well-established competitors and from companies developing in-house solutions and capabilities.
9 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Regulation Federal and state laws and regulations extensively regulate the operations of our credit card services bank subsidiary, World Financial Network National Bank, as well as our industrial bank, World Financial Capital Bank. Many of these laws and regulations are intended to maintain the safety and soundness of World Financial Network National Bank and World Financial Capital Bank, and they impose significant restraints on those companies to which other non-regulated companies are not subject. Because World Financial Network National Bank is deemed a credit card bank and World Financial Capital Bank is an industrial bank within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, we are not subject to regulation as a bank holding company. If we were subject to regulation as a bank holding company, we would be constrained in our operations to a limited number of activities that are closely related to banking or financial services in nature. Nevertheless, as a national bank, World Financial Network National Bank is still subject to overlapping supervision by the OCC and the FDIC; and, as an industrial bank, World Financial Capital Bank is still subject to overlapping supervision by the FDIC and the State of Utah.
World Financial Network National Bank and World Financial Capital Bank must maintain minimum amounts of regulatory capital. If World Financial Network National Bank or World Financial Capital Bank do not meet these capital requirements, their respective regulators have broad discretion to institute a number of corrective actions that could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. World Financial Capital Bank, as an institution insured by the FDIC, must maintain certain capital ratios, paid-in capital minimums and adequate allowances for loan losses. World Financial Network National Bank must meet specific guidelines that involve measures and ratios of its assets, liabilities, regulatory capital, interest rate exposure and certain off-balance sheet items under regulatory accounting standards, among other factors. Under the National Bank Act, if the capital stock of World Financial Network National Bank is impaired by losses or otherwise, we, as the sole shareholder, may be assessed the deficiency. To the extent necessary, if a deficiency in capital still exists, the FDIC may be appointed as a receiver to wind up World Financial Network National Banks affairs.
Before World Financial Network National Bank can pay dividends to us, it must obtain prior regulatory approval if all dividends declared in any calendar year would exceed its net profits for that year plus its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any transfers to surplus. In addition, World Financial Network National Bank may only pay dividends to the extent that retained net profits, including the portion transferred to surplus, exceed bad debts. Moreover, to pay any dividend, World Financial Network National Bank must maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. Further, if a regulatory authority believes that World Financial Network National Bank is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound banking practice, which, depending on its financial condition, could include the payment of dividends, that regulatory authority may require, after notice and hearing, that World Financial Network National Bank cease and desist from the unsafe practice. Before World Financial Capital Bank can pay dividends to us, it must obtain prior written regulatory approval.
As part of an acquisition in 2003 by World Financial Network National Bank, which required approval by the OCC, the OCC required World Financial Network National Bank to enter into an operating agreement with it and a capital adequacy and liquidity maintenance agreement with us. The operating agreement requires World Financial Network National Bank to continue to operate in a manner consistent with its current practices, regulatory guidelines and applicable law, including those related to affiliate transactions, maintenance of capital and corporate governance. This operating agreement has not required any changes in World Financial Network National Banks operations. The capital adequacy and liquidity maintenance agreement memorializes our current obligations to World Financial Network National Bank.
We are limited under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act in the extent to which we can borrow or otherwise obtain credit from or engage in other covered transactions with World Financial Network National Bank or World Financial Capital Bank, which may have the effect of limiting the extent to which World Financial Network National Bank or World Financial Capital Bank can finance or otherwise supply funds to us.
10 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Covered transactions include loans or extensions of credit, purchases of or investments in securities, purchases of assets, including assets subject to an agreement to repurchase, acceptance of securities as collateral for a loan or extension of credit, or the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance, or letter of credit. Although the applicable rules do not serve as an outright bar on engaging in covered transactions, they do require that we engage in covered transactions with World Financial Network National Bank or World Financial Capital Bank only on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to World Financial Network National Bank or World Financial Capital Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. Furthermore, with certain exceptions, each loan or extension of credit by World Financial Network National Bank or World Financial Capital Bank to us or our other affiliates must be secured by collateral with a market value ranging from 100% to 130% of the amount of the loan or extension of credit, depending on the type of collateral.
We are required to monitor and report unusual or suspicious account activity as well as transactions involving amounts in excess of prescribed limits under the Bank Secrecy Act, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules, and other regulations. Congress, the IRS and the bank regulators have focused their attention on banks monitoring and reporting of suspicious activities. Additionally, Congress and the bank regulators have proposed, adopted or passed a number of new laws and regulations that may increase reporting obligations of banks. We are also subject to numerous laws and regulations that are intended to protect consumers, including state laws, the Truth in Lending Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act. These laws and regulations mandate various disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which we may interact with consumers. These and other laws also limit finance charges or other fees or charges earned in our activities. We conduct our operations in a manner that we believe excludes us from regulation as a consumer reporting agency under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. If we were deemed a consumer reporting agency, however, we would be subject to a number of additional complex regulatory requirements and restrictions.
A number of privacy regulations have been implemented in the United States, Canada, the European Union and China in recent years. These regulations place many new restrictions on our ability to collect and disseminate customer information. In addition, the enactment of new or amended legislation around the world could place additional restrictions on our ability to utilize customer information.
Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, we are required to maintain a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards relating to customer information. We also were required to develop an initial privacy notice and we are required to provide annual privacy notices to customers that describe in general terms our information sharing practices. If we intend to share nonpublic personal information about customers with nonaffiliated third parties, we must provide our customers with a notice and a reasonable period of time for each customer to opt out of any such disclosure.
In addition to the federal privacy laws with which we must comply, states also have adopted statutes, regulations or other measures governing the collection and distribution of nonpublic personal information about customers. In some cases these state measures are preempted by federal law, but if not, we monitor and seek to comply with individual state privacy laws in the conduct of our business.
We also have systems and processes to comply with the USA PATRIOT ACT of 2001, which is designed to deter and punish terrorist acts in the United States and around the world, to enhance law enforcement investigatory tools, and for other purposes.
Canada has likewise enacted privacy legislation known as the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. This act requires organizations to obtain a consumers consent to collect, use or disclose personal information. Under this act, which took effect on January1, 2001, the nature of the required consent depends on the sensitivity of the personal information, and the act permits personal information to be used only for the purposes for which it was collected. Some provinces have enacted substantially similar privacy legislation. We believe we have taken appropriate steps with our AIR MILES Reward Program to comply with these laws.
11 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Employees As of December31, 2007, we had approximately 9,800 employees. We believe our relations with our employees are good. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees.

No information from this web site is incorporated by reference herein. These documents are posted to our web site as soon as reasonably practicable after we have filed or furnished these documents with the SEC. We post our audit committee, compensation committee, nominating and corporate governance committee, and executive committee charters, our corporate governance guidelines, and our code of ethics, code of ethics for Senior Financial Executives and Chief Executive Officer, and code of ethics for Board Members on our web site.

Risk Factors Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Company We cannot give any assurance that the Merger will be consummated.
Consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of various closing conditions. While certain of these conditions have been satisfied, including, among others, adoption of the Merger Agreement by a vote of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our common stock, the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and issuance of a ruling under the Competition Act (Canada) or expiration, termination or waiver under that Act, there are still several conditions to closing that have not been satisfied, including obtaining required approvals from the FDIC, the OCC and the Utah Commissioner of Financial Institutions with respect to our banking operations and certain other customary closing conditions described in the Merger Agreement. We cannot guarantee that all of the conditions precedent to consummating the Merger will be satisfied or that the Merger will be successfully completed. On January25, 2008, Aladdin Solutions, Inc. (f/k/a Aladdin Holdco, Inc.) informed us in a written notice that it did not anticipate the condition to closing the Merger relating to obtaining approvals from the OCC would be satisfied. In response to the notice and subsequent conversations with Aladdin Solutions, Inc.s representatives, on January30, 2008, we filed a lawsuit against Aladdin Solutions, Inc. and Aladdin Merger Sub, Inc., the acquisition entities formed by affiliates of The Blackstone Group to acquire us pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, seeking specific performance to compel these entities to comply with their obligations under the Merger Agreement, including their covenants to use reasonable best efforts to obtain required regulatory approvals and to consummate the Merger. On February8, 2008, we filed a motion to dismiss our lawsuit without prejudice in response to confirmation of these entities commitment to work to consummate the Merger. Although we are working with these entities to effect an acceptable solution to the unresolved regulatory issues, there can be no assurance that an acceptable solution will be obtained or that the Merger will be completed.
In the event that the Merger is not completed:  managements attention from our day-to-day business may be diverted;  we may lose key employees;  our relationships with customers and vendors may be disrupted as a result of uncertainties with regard to our business and prospects;  we may be required to pursue legal action to enforce our rights under the Merger Agreement;  we may be exposed to litigation claims from third parties relating to the failure to complete the Merger;  we may be required to pay significant transaction costs related to the Merger; and  the market price of shares of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of those shares reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed.
Any such events could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition and could adversely affect our stock price.
Delaware law and our charter documents could prevent a change of control that might be beneficial to you.
Delaware law, as well as provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, could discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire us, even though such proposals may be beneficial to you. These include:  a board of directors classified into three classes of directors with the directors of each class having staggered, three-year terms;  our boards authority to issue shares of preferred stock without further stockholder approval;and 13 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  provisions of Delaware law that restrict many business combinations and provide that directors serving on staggered boards of directors, such as ours, may be removed only for cause.
These provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could discourage tender offers or other transactions that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for our common stock.
Future sales of our common stock, or the perception that future sales could occur, may adversely affect our common stock price.
As of February22, 2008 , we had an aggregate of 100,909,467shares of our common stock authorized but unissued and not reserved for specific purposes. While we are currently restricted by the terms of the Merger Agreement, in general, we may issue all of these shares without any action or approval by our stockholders. We have reserved 21,003,000shares of our common stock for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan and our long-term incentive plans, of which 5,212,133shares are issuable upon vesting of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and upon exercise of options granted as of February22, 2008, including options to purchase approximately 4,030,114shares exercisable as of February22, 2008 or that will become exercisable within 60days after February22, 2008. We have reserved for issuance 1,500,000shares of our common stock, all of which remain issuable, under our 401(k) and Retirement Savings Plan. In addition, we may pursue acquisitions of competitors and related businesses and may issue shares of our common stock in connection with these acquisitions. Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock, and any sale or issuance of our common stock will dilute the percentage ownership held by our stockholders.
A limited number of stockholders report ownership of a significant amount of our common stock. These stockholders may have interests that conflict with yours and, if they were to act together, may be able to control the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, including a change in control.
Pursuant to the information provided in various filings with the SEC on Schedules 13D or 13G and amendments thereto, there are five separategroups of affiliated entities that beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 35% of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders, if acting together, may be able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, changes to our charter documents and significant corporate actions, including a change in control. These stockholders may have interests that conflict with our interests or those of other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may prevent any other holder or group of holders of our common stock from being able to affect the way we are managed or the direction of our business. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock.
Risks Related to General Business Operations Our 10 largest clients represented 40.7% of our consolidated revenue in 2007, and the loss of any of these clients could cause a significant drop in our revenue.
We depend on a limited number of large clients for a significant portion of our consolidated revenue. Our 10 largest clients represented approximately 40.7% of our consolidated revenue during the year ended December31, 2007, with BMO Bank of Montreal representing approximately 10.2% of our 2007 consolidated revenue. A decrease in revenue from any of our significant clients for any reason, including a decrease in pricing or activity, or a decision to either utilize another service provider or to no longer outsource some or all of the services we provide, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated revenue.
14 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Marketing Services.
Our 10 largest clients in this segment represented approximately 48.9% of our Marketing Services revenue in 2007. BMO Bank of Montreal represented approximately 21.5% of this segments 2007 revenue. Our contract with BMO Bank of Montreal expires in 2009.
Credit Services.
Our 10 largest clients and their customers in this segment represented approximately 84.5% of our Credit Services revenue in 2007. Intimate Brands and its retail affiliates represented approximately 20.9%, and Redcats represented approximately 12.4% of our Credit Services revenue in 2007. Our contracts with Intimate Brands and its retail affiliates expire in 2012, and our contract with Redcats expires in 2016.
Transaction Services.
Our 10 largest clients in this segment represented approximately 45.8% of our Transaction Services revenue in 2007.
Competition in our industries is intense and we expect it to intensify.
The markets for our products and services are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in each of those markets. Many of our current competitors have longer operating histories, stronger brand names and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. Certain of our business units also compete against in-house staffs of our current clients and others or internally developed products and services by our current clients and others. For example, as a result of increasing competitors in the loyalty market, including from the Aeroplan Program, one of Canadas largest loyalty marketing programs, we may experience greater competition in attracting and retaining sponsors in our AIR MILES Reward Program. Our ability to generate significant revenue from clients and partners will depend on our ability to differentiate ourselves through the products and services we provide and the attractiveness of our programs to consumers. We may not be able to compete successfully against our current and potential competitors.
The markets for the services that we offer may fail to expand or may contract and this could negatively impact our growth and profitability.
Our growth and continued profitability depend on acceptance of the services that we offer. Our clients may not continue to use loyalty and targeted marketing strategies. Changes in technology may enable merchants and retail companies to directly process transactions in a cost-efficient manner without the use of our services. Additionally, downturns in the economy or the performance of retailers may result in a decrease in the demand for our marketing strategies. Further, if customers make fewer purchases of our customers products and services, we will have fewer transactions to process, resulting in lower revenue. Any decrease in the demand for our services for the reasons discussed above or any other reasons could have a materially adverse effect on our growth, revenue and operating results.
If we fail to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or to integrate the businesses we acquire, it could negatively affect our business.
Historically, we have engaged in a significant number of acquisitions, and those acquisitions have contributed to our growth in revenue and profitability. While we believe that acquisitions will continue to be a key component of our growth strategy, our focus for 2008 is expected to be on organic growth. However, we may not be able to continue to locate and secure acquisition candidates on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates, our growth could be impaired. There are several risks to acquisitions, including:  the difficulty and expense that we incur in connection with the acquisition;  adverse accounting consequences of conforming the acquired companys accounting policies to ours;  the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns;  the potential loss of customers or key employees of the acquired company; 15 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  the impact on our financial condition due to the timing of the acquisition or the failure to meet operating expectations of the acquired business; and  the assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired company.
Acquisitions that we make may not be successfully integrated into our ongoing operations and we may not achieve any expected cost savings or other synergies from any acquisition. If the operations of an acquired business do not meet expectations, our profitability and cash flows may be impaired and we may be required to restructure the acquired business or write-off the value of some or all of the assets of the acquired business.
Failure to safeguard our databases and consumer privacy could affect our reputation among our clients and their customers, and may expose us to legal claims.
As part of our AIR MILES Reward Program, targeted marketing services programs and credit card programs, we maintain databases containing information on consumers account transactions. Our databases may be subject to unauthorized access. If we experience a security breach, the integrity of our databases could be affected. Security and privacy concerns may cause consumers to resist providing the personal data necessary to support our profiling capability. The use of our loyalty, marketing services or credit card programs could decline if any compromise of security occurred. In addition, any unauthorized release of consumer information, or any public perception that we released consumer information without authorization, could subject us to legal claims from consumers or regulatory enforcement actions and adversely affect our client relationships.
As a result of our significant Canadian operations, our reported financial information will be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollars.
A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our operations in Canada, which transact business in Canadian dollars. Therefore, our reported financial information from quarter-to-quarter will be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollars over the relevant periods. We do not hedge any of our exchange rate exposure in our Canadian operations.
The Canadian dollar has been trading at historically high rates against the U.S. dollar in recent periods. If the Canadian dollar were to decline in value in subsequent periods, our operating results would be negatively impacted and we would not have the benefit of the favorable revenue impact we have experienced in recent periods as a result of the strength of the Canadian dollar.
The hedging activity related to our securitization trusts and our floating rate indebtedness subjects us to off-balance sheet counterparty risks relating to the creditworthiness of the commercial banks with whom we enter into hedging transactions.
In order to execute hedging strategies related to the securitization trusts and our floating rate indebtedness, we have entered into interest rate derivative contracts with commercial banks. These banks are considered counterparties. It is our policy to enter into such contracts with counterparties that are deemed to be creditworthy. However, if macro- or micro-economic events were to negatively impact these banks, the banks might not be able to honor their obligations either to us or to the securitization trusts and we might suffer a direct loss or a loss related to our residual interest in the securitization trusts.
Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position, and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third party allegations of infringement may be costly.
Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our trademarks or other intellectual property rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. The actions we take to protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights may not be adequate. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the 16 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements proprietary rights of others. We may not be able to prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information. Any infringement or misappropriation could harm any competitive advantage we currently derive or may derive from our proprietary rights. Third parties may also assert infringement claims against us. Any claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages may also result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims. An adverse determination in any litigation of this type could require us to design around a third partys patent or to license alternative technology from another party. In addition, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of our time and resources.
Loss of data center capacity, interruption of telecommunication links, computer viruses or inability to utilize proprietary software of third party vendors could affect our ability to timely meet the needs of our clients and their customers.
Our ability to protect our data centers against damage or inoperability from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, computer viruses and other disasters is critical. In order to provide many of our services, we must be able to store, retrieve, process and manage large amounts of data and periodically expand and upgrade our database capabilities. Any damage to our data centers, any failure of our telecommunication links that interrupts our operations or any impairment of our ability to use our software or the proprietary software of third party vendors, including impairments due to virus attacks, could adversely affect our ability to meet our clients needs and their confidence in utilizing us for future services.
If we are required to pay state taxes on transaction processing, it could negatively impact our profitability.
Transaction processing companies may be subject to state taxation of certain portions of their fees charged to merchants for their services. If we are required to pay such taxes and are unable to pass this tax expense through to our merchant clients, these taxes would negatively impact our profitability.
We rely on third party vendors to provide products and services. Our profitability could be adversely impacted if they fail to fulfill their obligations.
The failure of the companys suppliers to deliver products and services in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect the companys business. If our significant vendors were unable to renew our existing contracts we might not be able to replace the related product or service at the same cost which would negatively impact our profitability.
Risks Particular to Marketing Services If actual redemptions by AIR MILES Reward Program collectors are greater than expected, or if the costs related to redemption of AIR MILES reward miles increase, our profitability could be adversely affected.
A portion of our revenue is based on our estimate of the number of AIR MILES reward miles that will go unused by the collector base. The percentage of unredeemed AIR MILES reward miles is known as breakage in the loyalty industry. AIR MILES reward miles currently do not expire. We experience breakage when AIR MILES reward miles are not redeemed by collectors for a number of reasons, including:  loss of interest in the program or sponsors;  collectors moving out of the program area; and  death of a collector.
If actual redemptions are greater than our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected due to the cost of the excess redemptions. Our AIR MILES Reward Program also exposes us to risks arising from 17 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements potentially increasing reward costs. Our profitability could be adversely affected if costs related to redemption of AIR MILES reward miles increase.
The loss of our most active AIR MILES Reward Program collectors could negatively affect our growth and profitability.
Our most active AIR MILES Reward Program collectors drive a disproportionate percentage of our AIR MILES Reward Program revenue. The loss of a significant portion of these collectors, for any reason, could impact our ability to generate significant revenue from sponsors. The continued attractiveness of our loyalty and rewards programs will depend in large part on our ability to remain affiliated with sponsors that are desirable to consumers and to offer rewards that are both attainable and attractive.
Airline or travel industry disruptions, such as an airline insolvency, could negatively affect the AIR MILES Reward Program, our revenues and profitability.
Air travel is one of the appeals of the AIR MILES Reward Program to collectors. As a result of airline insolvencies and restructurings, we may experience service disruptions that prevent us from fulfilling collectors flight redemption requests. If one of our existing airline suppliers sharply reduces its fleet capacity and route network, we may not be able to satisfy our collectors demands for airline tickets. Tickets from other airlines, if available, could be more expensive than a comparable ticket under our current supply agreements with existing suppliers, and the routes offered by the other airlines may be inadequate, inconvenient or undesirable to the redeeming collectors. As a result, we may experience higher air travel redemption costs and collector satisfaction with the AIR MILES Reward Program might be adversely affected.
As a result of airline or travel industry disruptions, political instability, terrorist acts or war, some collectors could determine that air travel is too dangerous or burdensome. Consequently, collectors might forego redeeming AIR MILES reward miles for air travel and therefore might not participate in the AIR MILES Reward Program to the extent they previously did, which could adversely affect our revenue.
Legislation relating to consumer privacy may affect our ability to collect data that we use in providing our marketing services, which, among other things, could negatively affect our ability to satisfy our clients needs.
The enactment of new or amended legislation or industry regulations arising from public concern over consumer privacy issues could have a material adverse impact on our marketing services. Legislation or industry regulations regarding consumer privacy issues could place restrictions upon the collection, sharing and use of information that is currently legally available, which could materially increase our cost of collecting some data. These types of legislation or industry regulations could also prohibit us from collecting or disseminating certain types of data, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our clients requirements and our profitability and cash flow. In addition to the United States and Canadian regulations discussed below, we have recently expanded our marketing services through the acquisition of companies formed and operating in foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional or more stringent legislation and regulations regarding consumer privacy.
In the United States, federal and state laws such as the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, make it more difficult to collect, share and use information that has previously been legally available and may increase our costs of collecting some data. Regulations under these acts give cardholders the ability to opt out of having information generated by their credit card purchases shared with other affiliated and unaffiliated parties or the public. Our ability to gather, share and utilize this data will be adversely affected if a significant percentage of the consumers whose purchasing behavior we track elect to opt out, thereby precluding us and our affiliates from using their data.
In the United States, the federal Do-Not-Call Implementation Act makes it more difficult to telephonically communicate with prospective and existing customers. Regulations under this act give consumers the ability to 18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements opt out, through a national do-not-call registry and state do-not-call registries of having telephone solicitations placed to them by companies that do not have an existing business relationship with the consumer. In addition, regulations require companies to maintain an internal do-not-call list for those who do not want the companies to solicit them through telemarketing. This act could limit our ability to provide services and information to our clients. Failure to comply with the terms of this act could have a negative impact on our reputation and subject us to significant penalties.
In the United States, the federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 restricts our ability to send commercial electronic mail messages, the primary purpose of which is advertising or promoting a commercial product or service, to our customers and prospective customers. The act requires that a commercial electronic mail message provide the customers with an opportunity to opt-out from receiving future commercial electronic mail messages from the sender. Failure to comply with the terms of this act could have a negative impact on our reputation and subject us to significant penalties.
In Canada, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act requires an organization to obtain a consumers consent to collect, use or disclose personal information. Under this act, consumer personal information may be used only for the purposes for which it was collected. We allow our customers to voluntarily opt out from receiving either one or both promotional and marketing mail or promotional and marketing electronic mail. Heightened consumer awareness of, and concern about, privacy may result in customers opting out at higher rates than they have historically. This would mean that a reduced number of customers would receive bonus and promotional offers and therefore those customers may collect fewer AIR MILES reward miles.
Risks Particular to Credit Services If we are unable to securitize our credit card receivables due to changes in the market, the unavailability of credit enhancements, an early amortization event or for other reasons, we would not be able to fund new credit card receivables, which would have a negative impact on our operations and earnings.
Since January 1996, we have sold a majority of the credit card receivables originated by World Financial Network National Bank to WFN Credit Company, LLC and WFN Funding Company II, LLC, which in turn sold them to World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust, World Financial Network Credit Card Master Note Trust and World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust III (the WFN Trusts) as part of our securitization program. This securitization program is the primary vehicle through which we finance World Financial Network National Banks credit card receivables. If World Financial Network National Bank were not able to regularly securitize the receivables it originates, our ability to grow or even maintain our Retail business would be materially impaired. World Financial Network National Banks ability to effect securitization transactions is affected by the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:  conditions in the securities markets in general and the asset-backed securitization market in particular;  conformity of the quality of credit card receivables to rating agency requirements and changes in that quality or those requirements; and  our ability to fund required over-collateralizations or credit enhancements, which we routinely utilize in order to achieve better credit ratings, which lowers our borrowing costs.
In the second half of 2007, conditions in the securities market in general and the asset-backed securitization market in particular deteriorated significantly. If these conditions persist, deteriorate further or recur in the future, World Financial Network National Bank may not be able to securitize the receivables it originates on terms similar to those it has received historically, or at all. In particular, we have approximately $600.0 million of asset-backed notes that will become due in the second quarter of 2008. Our ability to refinance these notes on favorable terms or at all will depend upon our ability to continue to securitize our receivables, which will depend upon the conditions in the securities market at the time, as well as the other factors described above.
19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Once World Financial Network National Bank securitizes receivables, the agreement governing the transaction contains covenants that address the receivables performance and the continued solvency of the retailer where the underlying sales were generated. In the event such a covenant or other similar covenant is breached, an early amortization event could be declared, whereby the trustee for the securitization trust would retain World Financial Network National Banks interest in the related receivables, along with the excess interest income that would normally be paid to World Financial Network National Bank, until the securitization investors are fully repaid. The occurrence of an early amortization event would significantly limit, or even negate, our ability to securitize additional receivables.
Increases in net charge-offs beyond our current estimates could have a negative impact on our operating income and profitability.
The primary risk associated with unsecured consumer lending is the risk of default or bankruptcy of the borrower, resulting in the borrowers balance being charged-off as uncollectible. We rely principally on the customers creditworthiness for repayment of the loan and therefore have no other recourse for collection. We may not be able to successfully identify and evaluate the creditworthiness of cardholders to minimize delinquencies and losses. An increase in defaults or net charge-offs beyond historical levels will reduce the net spread available to us from the securitization master trust and could result in a reduction in finance charge income or a write-down of the interest-only strip, our retained interest in the securitization program represented in our consolidated balance sheets as due from securitization. General economic factors, such as the rate of inflation, unemployment levels and interest rates, may result in greater delinquencies that lead to greater credit losses. In addition to being affected by general economic conditions and the success of our collection and recovery efforts, our delinquency and net credit card receivable charge-off rates are affected by the credit risk of our credit card receivables and the average age of our various credit card account portfolios. The average age of our credit card receivables affects the stability of delinquency and loss rates of the portfolio. An older credit card portfolio generally drives a more stable performance in the portfolio. As of December31, 2007, 60.5% of the total number of our securitized accounts with outstanding balances and 62.7% of the amount of our outstanding securitized receivables were for accounts with origination dates greater than 24 months old. For the year ended December31, 2007, our managed receivables net charge-off ratio was 5.8% compared to 5.0% and 6.5% for the same period in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our pricing strategy may not offset the negative impact on profitability caused by increases in delinquencies and losses. Any material increases in delinquencies and losses beyond our current estimates could have a materially adverse impact on us and the value of our net retained interests in loans that we sell through securitizations.
Changes in the amount of payments and defaults by cardholders on credit card balances may cause a decrease in the estimated value of interest-only strips.
The estimated fair value of our retained interest in our securitized credit card receivables, which we refer to as our interest-only strips, depends upon the anticipated cash flows of the related credit card receivables. A significant factor affecting the anticipated cash flows is the rate at which the underlying principal of the securitized credit card receivables is reduced. Other assumptions used in estimating the value of the interest-only strips include estimated future credit losses and a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. The rate of cardholder payments or defaults on credit card balances may be affected by a variety of economic factors, including interest rates and the availability of alternative financing, most of which are not within our control. A decrease in interest rates could cause cardholder payments to increase, thereby requiring a write down of the interest-only strips. If payments from cardholders or defaults by cardholders exceed our estimates, we may be required to decrease the estimated value of the interest-only strips through a charge against earnings.
Interest rate increases could significantly reduce the amount we realize from the spread between the yield on our assets and our cost of funding.
Interest Rate Risk.
Interest rate risk affects us directly in our lending and borrowing activities. Our total interest incurred was approximately $248.1 million for 2007, which includes both on-and off-balance sheet 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements transactions. Of this total, $80.2 million of the interest expense for 2007 was attributable to on-balance sheet indebtedness and the remainder was attributable to our securitized credit card receivables, which are financed off-balance sheet. To manage our risk from market interest rates, we actively monitor the interest rates and the interest sensitive components both on- and off-balance sheet to minimize the impact that changes in interest rates have on the fair value of assets, net income and cash flow. To achieve this objective, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates by matching asset and liability repricings and through the use of fixed-rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements. In addition, we enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and treasury locks to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt. We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for trading or other speculative purposes. At December31, 2007, we had $4.8 billion of debt, including $3.5 billion of off-balance sheet debt from our securitization program.
As of December31, 2007 Fixed rate Variable rate Total (In millions) Off-balance sheet $ 2,050.0 $ 1,438.4 $ 3,488.4 On-balance sheet 909.5 421.0 1,330.5 Total $ 2,959.5 $ 1,859.4 $ 4,818.9  At December31, 2007, our fixed rate off-balance sheet debt was locked at a current effective interest rate of 4.3% through interest rate swap agreements.
At December31, 2007, our fixed rate on-balance sheet debt was subject to fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5%.
A 1.0% increase in interest rates would result in an estimated decrease to pretax income of approximately $10.0 million related to our debt. The foregoing sensitivity analysis is limited to the potential impact of an interest rate increase of 1.0% on cash flows and fair values, and does not address default or credit risk.
We expect growth in our credit services segment to result from new and acquired credit card programs whose credit card receivable performance could result in increased portfolio losses and negatively impact our net retained interests in receivables securitized.
We expect an important source of growth in our credit card operations to come from the acquisition of existing credit card programs and initiating credit card programs with retailers who do not currently offer a private label or co-branded retail card. Although we believe our pricing and models for determining credit risk are designed to evaluate the credit risk of existing programs and the credit risk we are willing to assume for acquired and start-up programs, we cannot assure you that the loss experience on acquired and start-up programs will be consistent with our more established programs. The failure to successfully underwrite these credit card programs may result in defaults greater than our expectations and could have a materially adverse impact on us and the value of our net retained interests in receivables securitized.
Current and proposed regulation and legislation relating to our credit services could limit our business activities, product offerings and fees charged.
Various federal and state laws and regulations significantly limit the retail credit services activities in which we are permitted to engage. Such laws and regulations, among other things, limit the fees and other charges that we can impose on consumers, limit or proscribe certain other terms of our products and services, require specified disclosures to consumers, or require that we maintain certain licenses, qualifications and minimum capital levels. In some cases, the precise application of these statutes and regulations is not clear. In addition, 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements numerous legislative and regulatory proposals are advanced each year which, if adopted, could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability or further restrict the manner in which we conduct our activities. The failure to comply with, or adverse changes in, the laws or regulations to which our business is subject, or adverse changes in their interpretation, could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to collect our receivables and generate fees on the receivables, thereby adversely affecting our profitability.
If our bank subsidiaries fail to meet certain criteria, we may become subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act, which would force us to cease all of our non-banking activities and thus cause a drastic reduction in our profits and revenue.
If either of our depository institution subsidiaries failed to meet the criteria for the exemption from the definition of bank in the Bank Holding Company Act under which it operates (which exemptions are described below), and if we did not divest such depository institution upon such an occurrence, we would become subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act. This would require us to cease certain of our activities that are not permissible for companies that are subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act. One of our depository institution subsidiaries, World Financial Network National Bank, is a limited-purpose national credit card bank located in Ohio. World Financial Network National Bank will not be a bank as defined under the Bank Holding Company Act so long as it remains in compliance with the following requirements:  it engages only in credit card operations;  it does not accept demand deposits or deposits that the depositor may withdraw by check or similar means for payment to third parties;  it does not accept any savings or time deposits of less than $100,000, except for deposits pledged as collateral for its extensions of credit;  it maintains only one office that accepts deposits; and  it does not engage in the business of making commercial loans.
Our other depository institution subsidiary, World Financial Capital Bank, is a Utah industrial bank that is authorized to do business by the State of Utah and the FDIC. World Financial Capital Bank will not be a bank as defined under the Bank Holding Company Act so long as it remains an industrial bank in compliance with the following requirements:  it is an institution organized under the laws of a state which, on March5, 1987, had in effect or had under consideration in such states legislature a statute that required or would require such institution to obtain insurance under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act; and  it does not accept demand deposits that the depositor may withdraw by check or similar means for payment to third parties.
If our industrial bank fails to meet the requirements of the FDIC or State of Utah, we may be subject to termination of our industrial bank.
Our industrial bank, World Financial Capital Bank, is authorized to do business by the State of Utah and the FDIC. World Financial Capital Bank is subject to capital ratios and paid-in capital minimums and must maintain adequate allowances for loan losses. If World Financial Capital Bank fails to meet the requirements of the FDIC or the State of Utah, it may be subject to termination as an industrial bank.
22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Risks Particular to Transaction Services In 2007, our Transaction Services segment derived approximately 47.4% of its revenue from servicing cardholder accounts for the Credit Services segment. If the Credit Services segment suffered a significant client loss, our revenue and profitability attributable to the Transaction Services segment could be materially and adversely affected.
Our Transaction Services segment performs card processing and servicing activities for cardholder accounts generated by our Credit Services segment. During 2007, our Transaction Services segment derived $357.4 million, or 47.4% of its revenues, from these services for our Credit Services segment. The financial performance of our Transaction Services segment, therefore, is linked to the activities of our Credit Services segment. If the Credit Services segment were to lose a significant client, our revenue and profitability attributable to the Transaction Services segment could be materially and adversely affected.

Item3.
Legal Proceedings We are aware of litigation arising from what were originally four lawsuits filed against the Company and its directors in connection with the Merger. On May18, 2007, Sherryl Halpern filed a putative class action (cause no. 07-04689) on behalf of Company stockholders in the 68th Judicial District of Dallas County, Texas against the Company, all of its directors and The Blackstone Group (the Halpern Petition). On May21, 2007, Levy Investments, Ltd. (Levy) filed a purported derivative lawsuit (cause no. 219-01742-07) on behalf of the Company in the 219th Judicial District of Collin County, Texas against all of the Companys directors and The Blackstone Group (the Levy Petition) (this suit was subsequently transferred to the 296th Judicial District of Collin County, Texas and assumed the cause no. 296-01742-07). On May29, 2007, Linda Levine filed a putative 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements class action (cause no. 07-05009) on behalf of Company stockholders in the 192nd Judicial District of Dallas County, Texas against the Company and all of its directors (the Levine Petition). On May31, 2007, the J&V Charitable Remainder Trust filed a putative class action (cause no. 07-05127-F) on behalf of Company stockholders in the 116th Judicial District of Dallas County, Texas against the Company, all of its directors and The Blackstone Group (the J&V Petition).
The three putative class actions were consolidated in the 68th Judicial District Court of Dallas County, Texas (the Court) under the caption In re Alliance Data Corp. Class Action Litigation, No.07-04689. On July16, 2007, a consolidated class action petition was filed seeking a declaration that the action was a proper class action, an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining the Merger, a declaration that the director defendants breached their fiduciary duties and an award of fees, expenses and costs. The Company and its directors filed general denials in response to the putative class actions.
The derivative action filed by Levy was voluntarily dismissed and refiled in Dallas County (cause no. 07-06794), and was subsequently transferred to the Court. On July18, 2007, Levy filed an amended derivative petition seeking an injunction preventing consummation of the Merger, an order directing the director defendants to exercise their fiduciary duties to obtain a transaction beneficial to the Company and its stockholders, a declaration that the Merger Agreement was entered into in breach of the director defendants fiduciary duties and is unlawful and unenforceable, an order rescinding the Merger Agreement, the imposition of a constructive trust upon any benefits improperly received by the director defendants and an award of costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys and experts fees. On July24, 2007, the Company and its directors filed their Motion to Abate, Plea to the Jurisdiction and Special Exceptions to the derivative action.
On July12, 2007, class plaintiffs filed a motion to enjoin the scheduled August8, 2007 special meeting of stockholders at which stockholders would be asked to vote to adopt the Merger Agreement. On July20, 2007, Levy filed a motion reflecting its similar demand. On July27, 2007, the Company and its directors filed an opposition brief to both motions. The Company continued to deny all of the allegations in the consolidated class action petition and the amended derivative petition, contended that the asserted claims were baseless and strongly believed that its disclosures in the Companys definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on July5, 2007 (the Definitive Proxy) were appropriate and adequate under applicable law. Nevertheless, in order to lessen the risk of any delay of the closing of the Merger as a result of the litigation, the Company made available to its stockholders certain additional information in connection with the Merger, which was filed with the SEC on July27, 2007 and subsequently mailed to stockholders on or about July28, 2007 (the Proxy Supplement). Class action and derivative plaintiffs subsequently withdrew their motions to enjoin the August8, 2007 special meeting of stockholders.
Subsequently, on August7, 2007, Levy filed an Application for Attorneys Fees, stating that the substantive issues in the case had been resolved and seeking $750,000 in attorneys fees. Levy alleged that its lawsuit caused the Company to issue the Proxy Supplement, which, Levy contended, contained material disclosures critical to the stockholders assessment of the fairness of the Merger. Levy filed a Second Amended Petition and Amended Application for Attorneys Fees on October25, 2007, replacing Levy Investments with Yona Levy as plaintiff. In late December 2007, the parties reached a tentative settlement wherein the Company agreed to pay derivative plaintiffs counsel $290,000 as consideration for their contribution to the issuance of the Proxy Supplement. The settlement includes a mutual release between the Company and Yona Levy, in his individual capacity and in his derivative capacity as a stockholder of the Company. An order approving the settlement and a judgment dismissing the derivative claims were entered on January31, 2008.
On August14, 2007, class plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Petition, in which they withdrew all prior claims but added a claim for an equitable award of attorneys fees. Similar to Levy, class plaintiffs allege that their lawsuits caused the Company to issue the Proxy Supplement, and that the supplement constituted a benefit to the Company, its directors and stockholders for which class plaintiffs attorneys should be compensated. In mid-December 2007, the parties reached a tentative settlement wherein the Company agreed to pay class 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements plaintiffs counsel $380,000 as consideration for their contribution to the issuance of the Proxy Supplement. The parties are in the process of finalizing a stipulation of settlement, which must be approved by the Court.
We continue to contend that the disclosures in the Definitive Proxy were appropriate and adequate, and that we made the Proxy Supplement available to stockholders solely to lessen the risk of any delay of the closing of the Merger as a result of the litigation. We deny that the Proxy Supplement contained any material disclosures or constituted any benefit to the Company, its directors or its stockholders.
On January30, 2008, we filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Aladdin Solutions, Inc. (f/k/a Aladdin Holdco, Inc.) and Aladdin Merger Sub, Inc. seeking specific performance of their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement, including covenants to use reasonable best efforts to obtain required regulatory approvals and to consummate the Merger. This lawsuit was filed in response to a written notice we received on January25, 2008 from Aladdin Solutions, Inc. informing us that it did not anticipate the condition to closing the Merger relating to obtaining approvals from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would be satisfied. On February8, 2008, we filed a notice to dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice in response to confirmation of the defendants commitment to work to consummate the Merger.
In addition, from time to time we are involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our business that we believe will not have a material adverse affect on our business or financial condition, including claims and lawsuits alleging breaches of our contractual obligations.

(3) Per the terms of the Merger Agreement, we agreed that from May17, 2007 until the effective time of the Merger or the expiration or termination of the Merger Agreement, with certain exceptions, that we would not purchase any of our capital stock, which includes suspension of any repurchases under the third stock repurchase program or otherwise. Debt covenants in our credit facilities also restrict the amount of funds that we have available for repurchases of our common stock in any calendar year. The limitation for each calendar year was $200.0 million beginning with 2006, increasing to $250.0 million in 2007 and $300.0 million in 2008, conditioned on certain increases in our Consolidated Operating EBITDA as defined in the credit facilities.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Overview We are a leading provider of data-driven and transaction-based marketing and customer loyalty solutions. We offer a comprehensive portfolio of integrated outsourced marketing solutions, including customer loyalty programs, database marketing services, marketing strategy consulting, analytics and creative services, permission-based email marketing and private label retail credit card programs. We focus on facilitating and managing interactions between our clients and their customers through a variety of consumer marketing channels, including in-store, catalog, mail, telephone and on-line. We capture data created during each customer interaction, analyze the data and leverage the insight derived from that data to enable clients to identify and acquire new customers, as well as to enhance customer loyalty. We believe that our services are becoming increasingly valuable as companies continue to shift their marketing resources away from traditional mass marketing campaigns toward more targeted marketing programs that provide measurable returns on marketing investments. We operate in three business segments: Marketing Services, Credit Services and Transaction Services.
Marketing Services.
The Marketing Services segment generates revenue from our coalition loyalty program in Canada and targeted marketing services programs run by Epsilon.
In our AIR MILES Reward Program, we primarily collect fees from our clients based on the number of AIR MILES reward miles issued and, in limited circumstances, the number of AIR MILES reward miles redeemed. All of the fees collected for AIR MILES reward miles issued are deferred and recognized over time. AIR MILES reward miles issued and AIR MILES reward miles redeemed are the two primary drivers of loyalty services revenue and indicators of the success of the program. These two drivers are also important in the revenue recognition process.
AIR MILES Reward Miles Issued: The number of AIR MILES reward miles issued reflects the buying activity of the collectors at our participating sponsors, who pay us a fee per AIR MILES reward mile issued. The fees collected from sponsors for the issuance of AIR MILES reward miles represent future revenue and earnings for us. The revenue related to the service element of the AIR MILES reward miles (which consists of marketing and administrative services provided to sponsors) is initially deferred and amortized over a period of 42 months, which is the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile, beginning with the issuance of the AIR MILES reward mile and ending upon its expected redemption.
AIR MILES Reward Miles Redeemed: Redemptions show that collectors are redeeming AIR MILES reward miles to collect the rewards that are offered through our programs, which is an indicator of the success of the program. We also recognize revenue from the redemptions of AIR MILES reward miles by collectors. The revenue related to the redemption element is deferred until the collector redeems the AIR MILES reward miles or over the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile in the case of AIR MILES reward miles that we estimate will go unused by the collector base or breakage. We currently estimate breakage to be one-third of AIR MILES reward miles issued. There have been no changes to managements estimate of the life of a mile or breakage in the periods presented.
Our AIR MILES Reward Program tends not to be significantly impacted by economic swings, because many of our sponsors are in non-discretionary retail categories such as grocery stores, gas stations and pharmacies. Additionally, we target the sponsors most loyal customers, who we believe are unlikely to significantly change their spending patterns. We are impacted by changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar.
Epsilon is a leader in providing integrated direct marketing solutions that combine database marketing technology and analytics with a broad range of direct marketing services. Epsilon has over 500 clients, primarily in the financial services, specialty retail, hospitality and pharmaceutical end-markets. In 2006, we continued our expansion of the services we provide with the acquisition of DoubleClick Email Solutions, which strengthened 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements our presence in email communication solutions. With the acquisitions of iCom Information& Communications, Inc. (iCOM), a leading provider of consumer surveys, in early 2006, and CPC Associates, Inc. (CPC), a leading provider of new mover data, in the third quarter of 2006, Epsilon has also begun to expand its data product and services offerings. In addition, on February1, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Abacus, which is a leading provider of data, data management and analytical services for the retail and catalog industry, as well as other sectors. As a result of these acquisitions, we can offer our clients full end-to-end solutions, including marketing strategy consulting, data services, database development and management, marketing analytics, creative design and delivery services such as email communications.
Credit Services.
The Credit Services segment provides risk management solutions, account origination and funding services for our more than 85 private label retail card programs. Credit Services primarily generates revenue from securitization income, servicing fees from our securitization trusts and merchant discount fees. Private label credit sales and average managed receivables are the two primary drivers of revenue for this business unit.
Private Label Credit Sales: This represents the dollar value of private label retail card sales that occur at our clients point of sale terminals or through catalogs or web sites. Generally, we are paid a percentage of these sales, referred to as merchant discount, from the retailers that utilize our program. Private label credit sales typically lead to higher portfolio balances as cardholders finance their purchases through our credit card banks.
Average Managed Receivables: This represents the average balance of outstanding receivables from our cardholders at the beginning of each month during the period in question. Customers are assessed a finance charge based on their outstanding balance at the end of a billing cycle. There are many factors that drive the outstanding balances, such as payment rates, charge-offs, recoveries and delinquencies. Management actively monitors all of these factors. Generally we securitize our receivables, which results in a sale for accounting purposes and effectively removes the receivables from our balance sheet to one of the securitization trusts.
During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Lane Bryant portfolio was taken in-house by Lane Bryants parent company. The loss of this client will impact our private label sales and our average managed receivables. It is expected that the loss of the Lane Bryant portfolio will reduce overall revenue growth to mid- to high- single digits for 2008 in the Credit Services segment, after which time, it is expected to return to normal levels.
The Credit Services segment is affected by increased outsourcing in targeted industries. The growing trend of outsourcing private label retail card programs leads to increased accounts and balances to finance. We focus our sales efforts on prime borrowers and do not target sub-prime borrowers. Additionally, economic trends can impact this segment. Interest expense is a significant component of operating costs for the securitization trusts. Over the last three years we have experienced a historically low interest rate environment. However, interest rates in 2007 and 2006 were slightly higher than rates in 2005.
During the fourth quarter of 2005, Congress enacted bankruptcy legislation which had a two-fold impact. First, an acceleration of bankruptcies occurred in late 2005 as the result of an increased number of cardholders filing for bankruptcy protection who would otherwise not have been eligible to file for protection under the new legislation. Second, under the new legislation it became more difficult for cardholders filing for bankruptcy to dispose of their obligations to creditors. The enactment of the bankruptcy laws had a positive impact in 2006 to our net charge-off rate, which was approximately 5.0% for 2006 as compared to 6.5% for 2005. The net charge-off rate for the year ended December31, 2007 was 5.8% and we expect that the net charge-off rate for 2008 will be in the 6% range with costs of funds expected to remain consistent with 2007.
33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Transaction Services.
The Transaction Services segment primarily generates revenue based on the number of statements generated, customer calls handled and transactions processed. Statements generated is the primary driver of revenue for this segment and represents the majority of revenue.
Statements Generated: This represents the number of statements generated for our credit card and utility clients. The number of statements generated in any given period is a fairly reliable indicator of the number of active account holders during that period. In addition to receiving payment for each statement generated, we also are paid for other services such as remittance processing, customer care and various marketing and consulting services.
The Transaction Services segment is primarily affected by industry trends similar to Credit Services. Companies are increasingly outsourcing their non-core processes such as customer information systems, billing and customer care. We are impacted by this trend with our clients in utility services and issuer services.
When there are areas in our business units that no longer align with our strategy, we may explore the sale of those assets. On November7, 2007 we sold ADS MB Corporation, which operated our mail services business. These mail services included personalized customer communications and intelligent inserting and commingling capabilities for clients in the financial services, healthcare, retail, government and utilities end markets.

35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies that are described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our judgments and estimates in determination of our financial condition and operating results. Estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and, accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates, sometimes materially. Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require managements most subjective judgments. The most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below.
Securitization of credit card receivables.
We utilize a securitization program to finance a majority of the credit card receivables that we underwrite. We use our off-balance sheet securitization program to lower our cost of funds and more efficiently use capital. In a securitization transaction, we sell credit card receivables originated by our Credit Services segment to a trust and retain servicing rights to those receivables, an equity interest in the trust and an interest in the receivables. Our securitization trusts allow us to sell credit card receivables to the trusts on a daily basis. The securitization trusts are deemed to be qualifying special purpose entities under GAAP and are appropriately not included in our financial statements. Our interest in our securitization program is represented on our consolidated balance sheets as sellers interest (our interest in the receivables) and due from securitizations (our retained interests and credit enhancement components).
The trusts issue bonds in the capital markets and notes in private transactions. The proceeds from the bonds and other debt are used to fund the receivables, while cash collected from cardholders is used to finance new receivables and repay borrowings and related borrowing costs. The excess spread is remitted to us as securitization income.
Our retained interest, often referred to as an interest-only strip, is recorded at fair value. The fair value of our interest-only strip represents the present value of the anticipated cash flows we will receive over the estimated life of the receivables, which is 8.5 months. This anticipated excess cash flow consists of the excess of finance charges and past-due fees net of the sum of the return paid to bond and note holders, estimated contractual servicing fees and credit losses. Because there is not a highly liquid market for these assets, we estimate the fair value of the interest-only strip primarily based upon discount, payment and default rates, which is the method we assume that another market participant would use to purchase the interest-only strip. The fair value of the interest-only strip, and the corresponding gain or loss, will be impacted by the estimated excess spread over the following two or three quarters. The excess spread is impacted primarily by finance and late fees collected, net charge-offs and interest rates.
Changes in the fair value of the interest-only strip are reflected in our financial statements as additional gains related to new receivables originated and securitized or other comprehensive income related to mark-to-market changes of our residual interest.
In recording and accounting for interest-only strips, we make assumptions about rates of payments and defaults that we believe reasonably reflect economic and other relevant conditions that affect fair value. Due to subsequent changes in economic and other relevant conditions, the actual rates of principal payments and defaults generally differ from our initial estimates, and these differences could sometimes be material. If actual payment and default rates are higher than previously assumed, the value of the interest-only strip could be impaired and the decline in the fair value would be recorded in earnings. Further sensitivity information is provided in Note 8 of our audited consolidated financial statements.
We recognize the implicit forward contract to sell new receivables during a revolving period at its fair value at the time of sale. The implicit forward contract is entered into at the market rate and thus, its initial measure is 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements zero at inception. In addition, we do not mark the forward contract to fair value in accounting periods following the securitization because management has concluded that the fair value of the implicit forward contract in subsequent periods is not material. We believe that servicing fees received represent adequate compensation based on the amount currently demanded by the marketplace. Additionally, these fees are the same as would fairly compensate a substitute servicer should one be required and, thus, we neither record a servicing asset nor servicing liability.
AIR MILES Reward Program.
Because management has determined that the earnings process is not complete at the time an AIR MILES reward mile is issued, the recognition of revenue on all fees received based on issuance is deferred. We allocate the proceeds from issuances of AIR MILES reward miles into two components based on the relative fair value of the related element:  Redemption element.
The redemption element is the larger of the two components. For this component, we recognize revenue at the time an AIR MILES reward mile is redeemed, or, for those AIR MILES reward miles that we estimate will go unredeemed by the collector base, known as breakage, over the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile.
Service element.
For this component, which consists of marketing and administrative services provided to sponsors, we recognize revenue pro rata over the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile.
Under certain of our contracts, a portion of the proceeds is paid to us at the issuance of AIR MILES reward miles and a portion is paid at the time of redemption. Under such contracts the proceeds received at issuance are initially deferred as service revenue and the revenue and earnings are recognized pro rata over the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile.
The amount of revenue recognized in a period is subject to the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile. Based on our historical analysis, we make a determination as to average life of an AIR MILES reward mile. The estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile of 42 months and breakage of one-third has remained constant for all periods presented. Breakage and the life of an AIR MILES reward mile is based on managements estimate after viewing and analyzing various historical trends including vintage analysis, current run rates and other pertinent analysis. The estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile and breakage is actively monitored by management and subject to external influences that may cause actual performance to differ from estimates.
We believe that the issuance and redemption of AIR MILES reward miles is influenced by the nature and volume of sponsors, the type of rewards offered, the overall health of the Canadian economy, the nature and extent of AIR MILES promotional activity in the marketplace and the extent of competing loyalty programs. These influences will primarily affect the average life of an AIR MILES reward mile. We do not believe that the estimated life will vary significantly over time, consistent with historical trends. The shortening of the life of an AIR MILES reward mile would accelerate the recognition of revenue and may affect the breakage rate. As of December31, 2007, we had $828.3 million in deferred revenue related to the AIR MILES Reward Program that will be recognized in the future. Further information is provided in Note 11 of our audited consolidated financial statements.
Stock-based compensation.
On January1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of, and account for stock-based compensation in accordance with, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123 (revised 2004), Share- Based Payment (SFAS No.123(R)). We elected the modified-prospective method, under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123(R), stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized ratably over the requisite service period.
We currently use a binomial lattice option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.
37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience. We estimate the volatility of our common stock by using an implied volatility. We base the risk-free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on a forward curve of risk free interest rates based on constant maturity rates provided by the U.S. Treasury. We have not paid and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. All share-based payment awards are amortized on a straight-line basis over the awards requisite service periods, which are generally the vesting periods.
If factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense, the future periods may differ from what we have recorded in the current period and could affect our operating income, net income and net income per share.
See Note 15 of our audited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the SFAS No.123(R) disclosures.
Income Taxes.
We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.109 (FIN No.48). The application of income tax law is inherently complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures. Interpretations of, and guidance surrounding, income tax laws and regulations change over time. As such, changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. See Note 13 of our audited consolidated financial statements for additional detail on our uncertain tax positions and further information regarding FIN No.48.
Inter-Segment Sales Our Transaction Services segment performs card processing and servicing activities related to our Credit Services segment. For this, our Transaction Services segment receives a fee equal to its direct costs before corporate overhead plus a margin. The margin is based on current estimated market rates for similar services. This fee represents an operating cost to the Credit Services segment and corresponding revenue for our Transaction Services segment. Inter-segment sales are eliminated upon consolidation. Revenues earned by our Transaction Services segment from servicing our Credit Services segment, and consequently paid by our Credit Services segment to our Transaction Services segment, are set forth opposite Other/eliminations in the tables presented in the annual comparisons in our Results of Operations.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus stock compensation expense, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, fair value loss on interest rate derivative, other expenses, impairment of long-lived assets, loss on the sale of assets, merger and other costs, depreciation and other amortization and amortization of purchased intangibles. Operating EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to adjusted EBITDA plus the change in deferred revenue plus the change in redemption settlement assets. We have presented operating EBITDA because we use the financial measure to monitor compliance with financial covenants in our credit facilities and our senior note agreement. For the year ended December31, 2007, senior debt-to-operating EBITDA was 1.2x compared to a maximum ratio of 2.75x permitted in our credit facilities and in our senior note agreements. Operating EBITDA to interest expense was 9.4x compared to a minimum ratio of 3.5x permitted in our credit facilities and 3.0x permitted in our senior note agreement. As discussed in more detail in the liquidity section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, our credit facilities and cash flows from operations are the two main sources of funding for our acquisition strategy and for our future working 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements capital needs and capital expenditures. As of December31, 2007, we had borrowings of $421.0 million outstanding under the credit facilities, $500.0 million under our senior notes and had $417.0 million in unused borrowing capacity. We were in compliance with our covenants at December31, 2007, and we expect to be in compliance with these covenants during the year ended December31, 2008.
We use adjusted EBITDA as an integral part of our internal reporting to measure the performance of our reportable segments and to evaluate the performance of our senior management. Adjusted EBITDA is considered an important indicator of the operational strength of our businesses. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the uneven effect across all business segments of considerable amounts of non-cash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of certain intangible assets that were recognized in business combinations. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our businesses. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets, the impact of related impairments, as well as asset sales through other financial measures, such as capital expenditures, investment spending and return on capital and therefore the effects are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA also eliminates the non-cash effect of stock compensation expense. Stock compensation expense is not included in the measurement of segment adjusted EBITDA provided to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocations. Therefore, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to our investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA and operating EBITDA are not intended to be performance measures that should be regarded as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, either operating income or net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In addition, adjusted EBITDA and operating EBITDA are not intended to represent funds available for dividends, reinvestment or other discretionary uses, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The adjusted EBITDA and operating EBITDA measures presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in our various agreements.

Change in deferred revenue and change in redemption settlement assets are affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Change in redemption settlement assets is also affected by the timing of receipts and transfers of cash.

40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Revenue.
Total revenue increased $292.4 million, or 14.6%, to $2,291.2 million for the year ended December31, 2007 from $1,998.7 million for the comparable period in 2006. The increase was due to a 28.0% increase in Marketing Services revenue and a 10.5% increase in Credit Services revenue, offset by a 2.9% decrease in Transaction Services revenue as follows:  Marketing Services.
Revenue increased $237.8 million, or 28.0%, due to a combination of strong organic growth and acquisitions completed over the past twelve months. AIR MILES Reward Program growth was driven primarily by an increase in redemption revenue of $68.2 million related to a 10.9% increase in the redemption of AIR MILES reward miles. Issuance revenue increased $19.4 million primarily related to growth in issuances of AIR MILES reward miles in recent years from the roll out of major national programs. Within our revenue increase, changes in the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar had a $35.7 million positive impact on revenue for the AIR MILES Reward Program. Database and direct marketing fees revenue increased by $130.3 million primarily related to Epsilons recent acquisition of Abacus. Organic growth within Epsilons database marketing services division was partially offset by declines in Epsilons strategic marketing and consulting services division from lower volumes and a reduction of services provided to one of our clients.
Credit Services.
Revenue increased $77.0 million, or 10.5%, primarily due to a 10.5% increase in securitization income and finance charges, net. Securitization income and finance charges, net, increased $75.9 million, which includes an increase in the fair value of the gain on the interest-only strip of $20.5 million. The increase primarily resulted from a 7.4% increase in our average managed receivables and an increase in collected yield. This growth was partially offset by the normalization of our net charge-off rate in 2007 to 5.8% as compared to 5.0% in 2006. For the year ended December31, 2006, our net charge-off rate was impacted by abnormally low credit losses resulting from the enactment of bankruptcy reform legislation during the fourth quarter of 2005. Tempering the increase in revenue was a decline in merchant discount fees of approximately $8.1 million primarily as a result of a change in mix of fees received from merchants compared to fees received from cardholders.
Transaction Services.
Revenue decreased $22.7 million, or 2.9%. The decline in revenue can be attributed to a decline of $11.9 million in our merchant services business, as a result of attrition and pricing concessions, a decline of $8.6 million in our utility services business as a result of a decline in consulting services provided and a loss of revenue from our Mail Services business, which was sold on November7, 2007.
Operating Expenses.
For purposes of the discussion below, total operating expenses excludes stock compensation expense, depreciation expense, amortization expense, impairment charges, merger and other costs. Total operating expenses increased $165.1 million, or 11.1%, to $1,648.4 million for the year ended December31, 2007 from $1,483.4 million during the comparable period in 2006. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 28.1% for the year ended December31, 2007 from 25.8% for the comparable period in 2006 due to increased adjusted EBITDA margins across Marketing Services and Credit Services, offset by a decrease in adjusted EBITDA margin for Transaction Services.
Marketing Services . Operating expenses, as defined, increased $160.1 million, or 23.2%, to $850.1 million for the year ended December31, 2007 from $690.0 million for the comparable period in 2006, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 21.8% for the year ended December31, 2007 from 18.7% for the comparable period in 2006. Increases in operating expenses were primarily attributable to the acquisition of Abacus, as discussed above. Increases in operating expenses for the Air Miles Reward Program were due to an increase in costs of good sold primarily as a result from an increase in redemptions, as well as the impact of the exchange rate of the Canadian Dollar. Changes in the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar resulted in a $28.2 million increase in operating expenses for the AIR MILES Reward Program. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was due to the growth of the AIR MILES business and the impact of the Abacus acquisition.
41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  Credit Services.
Operating expenses, as defined, increased $7.5 million, or 1.6%, to $490.6 million for the year ended December31, 2007 from $483.1 million for the comparable period in 2006, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 39.3% for the year ended December31, 2007 from 33.9% for the comparable period in 2006. The increased adjusted EBITDA margin is the result of favorable revenue trends from an increase in our average managed receivables and an increase in collected yield. The adjusted EBITDA margin also benefited from increased staffing levels in our call centers and customer relationship areas as those costs were borne by the Transaction Services segment.
Transaction Services.
Operating expenses, as defined, decreased $2.9 million, or 0.4%, to $665.2 million for the year ended December31, 2007 from $668.1 million for the comparable period in 2006, and adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 11.7% for the year ended December31, 2007 from 13.9% during the comparable period in 2006. Operating expenses increased $16.5 million due to higher expenses in our private label retail services business for increased staffing levels in our call centers and customer relationship areas which in turn drove higher profits in our Credit Services segment. The increase was somewhat offset by a decline of expenses from our merchant services business and utility services business, as management proactively controlled expenses as revenue declined. There was also a decline in operating expenses from the sale of our mail services business which was sold on November7, 2007. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased primarily due to the incremental private label business expenses and declines in our utility service business and our mail services business.
Stock compensation expense.
Stock compensation expense increased $13.2 million, or 30.6%, to $56.2 million for the year ended December31, 2007 from $43.1 million for the comparable period in 2006. The increase was due primarily to the modification of terms of certain equity based awards aggregating $9.8 million, as well as the true up of certain estimates, including forfeitures upon the adoption of SFAS No.123(R) in 2006, of approximately $3.3 million.
Depreciation and Amortization.
Depreciation and amortization increased $41.6 million, or 33.3%, to $166.6 million for the year ended December31, 2007 from $125.0 million for the comparable period in 2006 primarily due to a $22.7 million increase in the amortization of purchased intangibles related to recent acquisitions and an increase of $18.9 million in depreciation and other amortization related in part to recent acquisitions as well as capital expenditures.
Merger and other costs.
In the second quarter of 2007, we entered into the Merger Agreement with an affiliate of The Blackstone Group. Costs associated with the proposed merger were approximately $12.4 million for the year ended December31, 2007 and include investment banking, legal and accounting costs. In addition, we incurred $7.2 million in compensation charges related to the severance of certain employees and other non-routine costs associated with our disposition of our mail services business.
Impairment of long-lived assets.
In the third quarter of 2007, we determined that certain long-lived assets, including internally developed software, certain customer relationship assets, and other assets, had been impaired. We recognized $40.0 million as a non-cash asset write-down, with the impairment charge included in our Transaction Services segment.
Loss on sale of assets.
On November7, 2007, we sold ADS MB Corporation, which operated our mail services business. These mail services included personalized customer communications and intelligent inserting and commingling. In connection with the sale, we recognized a loss of $16.0 million.
Operating Income.
Operating income decreased $3.0 million, or 0.9%, to $344.3 million for the year ended December31, 2007 from $347.3 million during the comparable period in 2006. Operating income decreased primarily as a result of the impairment of long-lived assets, the loss on the sale of our Mail Services division, as well as the revenue and expense factors discussed above.
Interest Income.
Interest income increased $4.1 million, or 62.1%, to $10.7 million for the year ended December31, 2007 from $6.6 million for the comparable period in 2006 due to higher average balances of our short-term cash investments.
42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Interest Expense.
Interest expense increased $32.6 million, or 68.5%, to $80.2 million for the year ended December31, 2007 from $47.6 million for the comparable period in 2006. Interest expense on core debt, which includes our credit facilities and senior notes, increased $30.6 million as a result of additional borrowings to fund our recent acquisitions and our stock repurchase program, offset slightly by a decrease in interest rates from the comparable period in 2006. Interest on our certificates of deposit increased by $3.3 million, which was impacted by higher average balances and an increase in interest rates.
Taxes.
Income tax expense decreased $6.0 million to $110.7 million for the year ended December31, 2007 from $116.7 million for the comparable period in 2006 due to a decrease in taxable income. Our effective tax rate increased to 40.3% for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to 38.1% for the comparable period in 2006, primarily due to a decrease in taxable income in certain jurisdictions, certain non-deductible expenses incurred in 2007 and changes in legislation enacted in various states and Canada.

44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Revenue.
Total revenue increased $446.3 million, or 28.7%, to $1,998.7 million for 2006 from $1,552.4 million for 2005. The increase was due to a 40.6% increase in Marketing Services, a 30.3% increase in Credit Services revenue, and a 10.9% increase in Transaction Services revenue, as follows:  Marketing Services. Marketing Services revenue increased $245.0 million, or 40.6%, due primarily to growth in the AIR MILES Reward Program and both organic growth and acquisition growth at Epsilon. AIR MILES Reward Program growth was driven primarily by an increase in redemption revenue of $77.2 million related to a 21.4% increase in the redemption of AIR MILES reward miles. Issuance revenue increased $16.7 million primarily due to growth in issuances of AIR MILES reward miles in recent years from the roll out of major national programs and increased AIR MILES Reward Program related to spending by certain sponsors for major national programs and campaigns. Changes in the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar accounted for approximately $31.2 million of the AIR MILES Reward Program revenue increase. Database and direct marketing fees revenue increased approximately $125.6 million primarily related to the acquisition of Epsilon businesses, Epsilon Interactive, ICOM, DoubleClick, and CPC.
Credit Services.
Credit Services revenue increased $169.9 million, or 30.3%, primarily due to a 42.8% increase in securitization income and finance charges, net offset by a decrease in merchant discount fees. Securitization income and finance charges, net increased $173.5 million primarily as a result of a 14.8% increase in our average managed receivables, an increase in collected yield and lower charge-offs. Cost of funds remained flat. The improvement in charge-off rates is a continuation of the benefit that we have received this year as a result of the bankruptcy reform legislation which was enacted during the fourth quarter of 2005, as well as overall higher credit quality. In addition, we also had a shift in the mix of fees charged for certain portfolios which resulted in a decrease in merchant discount fees but offset by increases in securitization income.
Transaction Services.
Transaction Services revenue increased $76.2 million, or 10.9%, primarily due to a 10.9% increase in statements generated from our private label and utility services businesses. The private label business increase was the result of a ramp up of clients signed along with solid growth in mature clients. Revenue for utility services was also positively impacted by both an increase in statements generated and additional service offerings to our existing clients.
Operating Expenses.
Total operating expenses, excluding depreciation, amortization and stock compensation expense increased $281.4 million, or 23.4%, to $1,483.4 million for 2006 from $1,202.0 million for 2005. Total adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 25.8% for 2006 from 22.6% for 2005. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin is due to increases in all of our segments. The EBITDA margin across our segments was positively impacted by corporate overhead as general and administrative costs remained flat between years. We were able to leverage our corporate infrastructure as revenues increased.
Marketing Services.
Marketing Services operating expenses, excluding depreciation, amortization and stock compensation expense, increased $183.7 million, or 36.3%, to $690.0 million for 2006 from $506.2 million for 2005 and adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 18.7% for 2006 from 16.2% for 2005. The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributed to the Epsilon business acquisitions and cost of sales from our AIR MILES Reward Program as a result of an increase in redemptions. Changes in the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar resulted in a $25.1 million increase in operating expenses for the AIR MILES Reward Program. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was due to margin expansion in our Epsilon and AIR MILES businesses, and margin contribution from relative decreases in allocated corporate overhead.
Credit Services.
Credit Services operating expenses, excluding depreciation, amortization and stock compensation expense, increased $84.2 million, or 21.1%, to $483.1 million for 2006 from $398.9 million for 2005, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 33.9% for 2006 from 28.9% for 2005. The increase in operating expenses is primarily attributed to the increase in cost of sales for statements generated and higher marketing expenses. The increased margin is the result of favorable revenue trends including an increase in our average managed receivables, an increase in collected yield and lower charge-offs, and margin contribution from relative decreases in allocated corporate overhead.
45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  Transaction Services.
Transaction Services operating expenses, excluding depreciation, amortization and stock compensation expense, increased $58.3 million, or 9.6%, to $668.1 million for 2006 from $609.8 million for 2005, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 13.9% for 2006 from 12.9% for 2005. The increase in operating expenses is primarily attributed to the increased volume of statements generated and accrued penalties for late system conversions on utility contracts, as well as additional expenses due to these conversion delays. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was the result of increases in revenue driven by a 10.9% increase in statements generated and margin contribution from relative decreases in allocated corporate overhead, offset by margin decrease in our utility services business. The utility services margin was impacted by conversion expenses for our clients.
Stock compensation expense.
Stock compensation expense increased $28.9 million, or 204.4%, to $43.1 million for 2006 from $14.1 million for 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to our adoption of SFAS No.123(R) under the modified prospective method. For the year ended December31, 2005, we would have recorded a total of $36.6 million of stock compensation expense under SFAS No.123.
Depreciation and Amortization.
Depreciation and amortization increased $25.3 million, or 25.4%, to $125.0 million for 2006 from $99.7 million for 2005. Amortization of purchased intangibles increased $18.5 million, of which $13.5 million relates to recent business acquisitions and $4.1 million relates to the amortization of premiums associated with the Blair portfolio acquisition completed in November 2005. The increase in depreciation and other amortization of $6.8 million is a result of relatively higher capital expenditures compared to prior years.
Operating Income.
Operating income increased $110.7 million, or 46.8%, to $347.3 million for 2006 from $236.6 million for 2005. Operating income increased primarily from revenue gains and an increase in adjusted EBITDA margins partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization and stock compensation expense.
Interest Income.
Interest income increased $2.6 million, or 64.2%, to $6.6 million for 2006 from $4.0 million for 2005 due to higher average balances of our short term cash investments, as well as an increase of the yield earned.
Interest Expense.
Interest expense increased $29.1 million, or 157.3%, to $47.6 million for 2006 from $18.5 million for 2005 due to higher average balances under our credit facilities and certificates of deposit. Interest expense on core debt, which includes the credit facility and senior notes, increased $20.0 million as a result of additional borrowings to fund our stock repurchase program and the acquisitions of ICOM, DoubleClick and CPC and an increase in interest rates from the comparable period in 2005. Interest on certificates of deposit increased $7.3 million due to growth in on-balance sheet receivables which was primarily associated with financing of the Blair portfolio acquisition completed in November 2005.
Provision for Income Taxes.
The provision for income taxes increased $33.3 million to $116.7 million in 2006 from $83.4 million in 2005 primarily due to an increase in taxable income. Our effective tax rate increased to 38.1% in 2006 compared to 37.5% in 2005 primarily as a result of changes in tax legislation in Texas and Canada.
Asset Quality Our delinquency and net charge-off rates reflect, among other factors, the credit risk of our private label credit card receivables, the average age of our various private label credit card account portfolios, the success of our collection and recovery efforts, and general economic conditions. The average age of our private label credit card portfolio affects the stability of delinquency and loss rates of the portfolio. We continue to focus resources on refining our credit underwriting standards for new accounts and on collections and post charge-off recovery efforts to minimize net losses.
46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements An older private label credit card portfolio generally drives a more stable performance in the portfolio. At December31, 2007, 60.5% of securitized accounts with balances and 62.7% of securitized receivables were for accounts with origination dates greater than 24 months old. At December31, 2006, 58.3% of securitized accounts with balances and 61.4% of securitized receivables were for accounts with origination dates greater than 24 months old. As of December31, 2007, our allowance for doubtful accounts related to on-balance sheet private label and co-branded credit card receivables was $38.7 million compared to $45.9 million as of December31, 2006. The decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts was primarily the result of improved seasoning of accounts with certain of our private label credit card portfolios.
Delinquencies.
A credit card account is contractually delinquent if we do not receive the minimum payment by the specified due date on the cardholders statement. It is our policy to continue to accrue interest and fee income on all credit card accounts beyond 90 days, except in limited circumstances, until the account balance and all related interest and other fees are paid or charged off, typically at 180 days delinquent. When an account becomes delinquent, we print a message on the cardholders billing statement requesting payment. After an account becomes 30 days past due, a proprietary collection scoring algorithm automatically scores the risk of the account rolling to a more delinquent status. The collection system then recommends a collection strategy for the past due account based on the collection score and account balance and dictates the contact schedule and collections priority for the account. If we are unable to make a collection after exhausting all in-house efforts, we engage collection agencies and outside attorneys to continue those efforts. Delinquency rates subsequent to the 2005 bankruptcy reform legislation have generally risen as it has become more difficult to file for bankruptcy protection under the law.
The following table presents the delinquency trends of our managed credit card portfolio: December31, 2007 % of Total December31, 2006 % of Total (In thousands, except percentages) Receivables outstanding $ 4,157,287 100 % $ 4,171,262 100 % Receivables balances contractually delinquent: 31 to 60 days 70,512 1.7 % 62,221 1.5 % 61 to 90 days 48,755 1.2 40,929 1.0 91 or more days 101,928 2.4 88,078 2.1 Total $ 221,195 5.3 % $ 191,228 4.6 % Net Charge-Offs.
Net charge-offs comprise the principal amount of losses from cardholders unwilling or unable to pay their account balances, as well as bankrupt and deceased cardholders, less current period recoveries. The following table presents our net charge-offs for the periods indicated on a managed basis. Average managed receivables represent the average balance of the cardholders at the beginning of each month in the year indicated.
Year Ended December31, 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands, except percentages) Average managed receivables $ 3,909,627 $ 3,640,057 $ 3,170,485 Net charge-offs 227,393 180,449 207,397 Net charge-offs as a percentage of average managed receivables 5.8 % 5.0 % 6.5 % The net charge-off rate during 2006 was impacted by abnormally low credit losses resulting from the enactment of bankruptcy reform legislation during the fourth quarter of 2005. Although we continued to benefit from the impact of the legislation in our 2007 results, the impact is significantly less than in 2006.
47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Age of Portfolio.
The median age of the portfolio is approximately 36 months. The following table sets forth, as of December31, 2007, the number of securitized accounts with balances and the related balances outstanding, based upon the age of the securitized accounts: Age Since Origination Numberof Accounts Percentageof Accounts Balances Outstanding Percentage of Balances Outstanding (In thousands, except percentages) 0-12 Months 2,719 24.4 % $ 845,846 22.8 % 13-24 Months 1,671 15.1 538,673 14.5 25-36 Months 1,232 11.1 407,448 11.0 37-48 Months 993 9.0 331,969 9.0 49-60 Months 874 7.9 293,222 7.9 Over 60 Months 3,604 32.5 1,288,267 34.8 Total 11,093 100.0 % $ 3,705,425 100.0 % Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities.
We have historically generated cash flows from operations, although that amount may vary based on fluctuations in working capital and the timing of merchant settlement activity. Our operating cash flow is seasonal, with cash utilization peaking at the end of December due to increased activity in our Credit Services segment related to holiday retail sales.
Year Ended December31, 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Cash provided by operating activities before changes in credit card portfolio activity and merchant settlement activity $ 461,862 $ 376,847 $ 293,863 Net change in credit card portfolio activity (5,780 ) 80,890 (186,419 ) Net change in merchant settlement activity 115,439 11,043 1,637 Cash provided by operating activities $ 571,521 $ 468,780 $ 109,081 Net change in credit card portfolio activity represents the difference in portfolios purchased from new clients and their subsequent sale to our securitization trusts. There is typically a several month lag between the purchase and sale of credit card portfolios. Merchant settlement activity is driven by the number of days of float at the end of the period. For these purposes, float means the difference between the number of days we hold cash before remitting the cash to our merchants and the number of days the card associations hold cash before remitting the cash to us. Merchant settlement activity fluctuates significantly depending on the day in which the period ends.
We generated cash flow from operating activities before changes in credit card portfolio activity and merchant settlement activity of $461.9 million for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to $376.8 million for the comparable period in 2006 or a 22.6% increase. The increase in operating cash flows before changes in credit card portfolio activity and merchant settlement activity is primarily related to an increase in net income as adjusted for non-cash charges. We utilize our cash flow from operations for ongoing business operations, acquisitions and capital expenditures.
Investing Activities.
We use a significant portion of our cash flows from operations for acquisitions and capital expenditures. We utilized cash flow from investing activities of $694.8 million for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to $543.0 million for the comparable period in 2006. Significant components of investing activities are as follows:  Acquisitions.
During the year ended December31, 2007, we had payments for acquired businesses totaling $438.2 million compared to $205.6 million in 2006, net of cash acquired. In 2007, the cash 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements outlay relates primarily to the acquisition of Abacus. In 2006, we acquired four businesses, which included DoubleClick Email Solutions, ICOM, Big Designs, and CPC Associates, all of which complemented and expanded our Marketing Services segment.
Securitizations and Receivables Funding.
We generally fund all private label credit card receivables through a securitization program that provides us with both liquidity and lower borrowing costs. As of December31, 2007, we had over $3.7 billion of securitized credit card receivables. Securitizations require credit enhancements in the form of cash, spread accounts and additional receivables. The credit enhancement is funded through the use of certificates of deposit issued through our subsidiary, World Financial Network National Bank. Net securitization and credit card receivable activity utilized $128.8 million for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to $236.5 million in 2006. We intend to utilize our securitization program for the foreseeable future.
Capital Expenditures.
Our capital expenditures for the year ended December31, 2007 were $116.7 million compared to $100.4 million for the prior year. Capital expenditures have typically been about 5% of annual revenue. During 2008, as certain office relocations and system conversions have been completed, we anticipate that capital expenditures will continue to decrease to approximately 3% of annual revenues.
Financing Activities.
Our cash flows provided by financing activities were $197.1 million in 2007 compared to $112.3 million provided by financing activities in 2006. Our financing activities for 2007 relate to borrowings and repayments of debt in the normal course of business, business acquisitions, $108.5 million for the repurchase of our common stock on the open market, proceeds from certain sales-lease back transactions and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
Liquidity Sources.
In addition to cash generated from operating activities, we have five main sources of liquidity: securitization program, certificates of deposit issued by World Financial Network National Bank and World Financial Capital Bank, our credit facilities and issuances of equity securities. We believe that internally generated funds and existing sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other business requirements, excluding the Merger, for at least the next 12 months.
If the Merger is consummated, we expect it will have a significant impact on liquidity and capital resources. Parent and Merger Sub have obtained equity and debt financing commitments for the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the proceeds of which, together with the available cash, will be sufficient for Parent and Merger Sub to pay the aggregate merger consideration and all related fees and expenses of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Securitization Program and Off-Balance Sheet Transactions.
Since January 1996, we have sold, sometimes through WFN Credit Company, LLC and WFN Funding Company II, LLC, a majority of credit card receivables owned by our credit card bank, World Financial Network National Bank, World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust, World Financial Network Credit Card Master Note Trust, World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust II and World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust III, which we refer to as the WFN Trusts as part of our securitization program. This securitization program is the primary vehicle through which we finance our private label credit card receivables. The following table shows expected maturities for borrowing commitments of the WFN Trusts under our securitization program by year: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 &Thereafter Total (In thousands) Public notes $ 600,000 $ 500,000 $  $ 450,000 $ 500,000 $ 2,050,000 Private conduits (1) 2,085,714     2,085,714 Total $ 2,685,714 $ 500,000 $  $ 450,000 $ 500,000 $ 4,135,714 (1) Represents borrowing capacity, not outstanding borrowings. In the fourth quarter of 2007 we renewed and amended $1,085.7 million of our $2,085.7 million private conduits under similar terms.
49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements As of December31, 2007, the WFN Trusts had over $3.7 billion of securitized credit card receivables. Securitizations require credit enhancements in the form of cash, spread deposits and additional receivables. The credit enhancement is principally based on the outstanding balances of the series issued by the WFN Trusts and by the performance of the private label credit cards in the securitization trust. During the period from November to January, the WFN Trusts are required to maintain a credit enhancement level of between 6% and 10% of securitized credit card receivables. Certain of the WFN Trusts are required to maintain a level of between 4% and 9% for the remainder of the year.
Certificates of Deposit.
We utilize certificates of deposit to finance the operating activities and fund securitization enhancement requirements of our credit card bank subsidiaries, World Financial Network National Bank and World Financial Capital Bank. World Financial Network National Bank and World Financial Capital Bank issue certificates of deposit in denominations of $100,000 in various maturities ranging between three months and two years and with effective annual fixed rates ranging from 5.0% to 5.7%. As of December31, 2007, we had $370.4 million of certificates of deposit outstanding. Certificate of deposit borrowings are subject to regulatory capital requirements.
Credit Facilities.
On January24, 2007, we entered into a bridge loan that provides for loans in a maximum amount of $400.0 million. At the closing of the bridge loan, we borrowed $300.0 million for general corporate purposes including the repayment of debt and the financing of permitted acquisitions. The bridge loan included an uncommitted accordion feature of up to $100.0 million allowing for future borrowings, subject to certain conditions.
On July6, 2007, we entered into a first amendment to the bridge loan to extend the maturity date from July24, 2007 to December31, 2007. On December21, 2007, we entered into a second amendment to the bridge loan which extended the maturity date from December31, 2007 to March31, 2008 and eliminated the uncommitted accordion feature, which had allowed for future borrowings up to $100.0 million, subject to certain conditions. In addition, the second amendment adjusts the margin applicable to base rate loans and Eurodollar loans to those set forth below. We anticipate renewing or refinancing the bridge loan prior to March31, 2008. If we are not able to refinance the bridge loan, we would expect to repay the amounts from available cash and borrowings under our consolidated credit facility.
The interest rate for base rate loans fluctuates and is equal to the higher of (A)the Bank of Montreals prime rate and (B)the Federal funds rate plus 0.5% plus a margin of (1)0.0% to 0.2% for the period from January1 to January31, 2008; (2)0.0% to 0.45% for the period from February1 to February29, 2008; and (3)0.1% to 0.70% for the period from March1 to March31, 2008, based upon our Senior Leverage Ratio as defined in the bridge loan. The interest rate for Eurodollar loans fluctuates based on the London interbank offered rate plus a margin of (1)1.1% to 1.7% for the period from January1 to January31, 2008; (2)1.35% to 1.95% for the period from February1 to February29, 2008; and (3)1.6% to 2.2% for the period from March1 to March31, 2008, based upon our Senior Leverage Ratio as defined in the bridge loan.
In March 2007, we amended our consolidated credit facility. The amendment extended the lending commitments which were scheduled to terminate on September29, 2011 to March30, 2012. In addition, the amendment adjusted the Senior Leverage Ratio applicable to the various levels set forth in the agreement and the margin applicable to Eurodollar loans. After giving effect to the amendment, the interest rate for Eurodollar loans denominated in U.S. or Canadian Dollars fluctuates based on the rate at which deposits of U.S. Dollars or Canadian Dollars, respectively, in the London interbank market are quoted plus a margin of 0.4% to 0.8% based upon the Senior Leverage Ratio as defined in the consolidated credit facility.
We were in compliance with the covenants under our credit facilities at December31, 2007.
Senior Notes.
On October22, 2007, the Company entered into an amendment in respect of the Note Purchase Agreement with all of the Holders (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) providing for a mandatory prepayment of all of the Notes on the date that the Merger is consummated. The Notes would be 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements repaid at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of prepayment and the Make-Whole Amount (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) as determined for the prepayment date in accordance with the terms of the amendment. The obligation of the Company to prepay the Notes pursuant to the terms of the amendment was subject to and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Merger on or prior to January1, 2008 and therefore is void and of no further force and effect since the Merger did not close on or prior to that date.
We utilize our credit facilities and excess cash flows from operations to support our acquisition strategy and to fund working capital and capital expenditures. However, we will incur significant indebtedness in order to complete the Merger and our future financing needs will be materially impacted by the Merger. Future indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to respond to market conditions or take advantage of business opportunities. If the Merger is consummated, our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, strategic acquisitions, and other investments will depend on our ability to generate cash flows from operations, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are not within our control.
At December31, 2007, we had borrowings of $421.0 million outstanding under the consolidated credit facility and the bridge loan, with a weighted average interest rate of 7.2%, $500.0 million under our senior notes, $2.0 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, and we had available unused borrowing capacity of approximately $416.9 million. The credit facility limits our aggregate outstanding letters of credit to $50.0 million. Additional details regarding our credit facilities and senior notes are set forth in Note 12 Debt of our audited consolidated financial statements.
Repurchase of Equity Securities.
During 2007, 2006, and 2005, we repurchased approximately 1.8million, 2.9million and 3.9million shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of $108.5 million, $146.0 million and $148.8 million, respectively. We have Board authorization to purchase an additional $496.7 million of our common stock through 2008.
Per the terms of the Merger Agreement, we agreed that from May17, 2007 until the effective time of the Merger or the expiration or termination of the Merger Agreement, with certain exceptions, we would not purchase any of our capital stock. Accordingly we have suspended any repurchases under our stock repurchase programs or otherwise. Debt covenants in the consolidated credit facility restrict the amount of funds that we have available for repurchases of our common stock in any calendar year. The limitation for each calendar year was $200.0 million beginning with 2006, increasing to a maximum of $250.0 million in 2007 and $300.0 million in 2008, conditioned on certain increases in our Consolidated Operating EBITDA as defined in the consolidated credit facility.
51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Contractual Obligations.
The following table highlights, as of December31, 2007, our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments by type and period: 2008 2009&2010 2011&2012 2013&Thereafter Total (In thousands) Certificates of deposit (1) $ 375,304 $  $  $  $ 375,304 Bridge loan (1) 305,408    305,408 Credit facility (1) 8,773 17,545 131,912  158,230 Senior notes (1) 30,350 286,289 265,350  581,989 Operating leases 55,013 82,732 53,507 89,224 280,476 Capital leases 18,030 24,836 466  43,332 Software licenses 6,777 10,746   17,523 FIN No.48 obligations (2)  1,959 572  2,531 Purchase obligations (3) 78,362 30,740 22,193  131,295 $ 878,017 $ 454,847 $ 474,000 $ 89,224 $ 1,896,088 (1) The certificates of deposit and credit facilities represent our estimated debt service obligations, including both principle and interest. Interest was based on the interest rates in effect as of December31, 2007, applied to the contractual repayment period.
(2) Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $80 million, of which the timing remains uncertain.
(3) Purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and specifying all significant terms, including the following: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligation amounts disclosed above represent estimates of the minimum for which we are obligated and the time period in which cash outflows will occur. Purchase orders and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table. Purchase obligations include purchase commitments under our AIR MILES Reward Program, minimum payments under support and maintenance contracts and agreements to purchase other goods and services.
We believe that we will have access to sufficient resources to meet these commitments.
Inflation and Seasonality Although we cannot precisely determine the impact of inflation on our operations, we do not believe that we have been significantly affected by inflation. For the most part, we have relied on operating efficiencies from scale and technology, as well as decreases in technology and communication costs, to offset increased costs of employee compensation and other operating expenses. Our revenues and earnings are favorably affected by increased consumer spending patterns leading up to and including the holiday shopping period in the fourth quarter and, to a lesser extent, during the first quarter as credit card balances are paid down.
Regulatory Matters World Financial Network National Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the OCC. World Financial Capital Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by both the FDIC and the State of Utah. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. Under the FDICs order approving World Financial Capital Banks application for deposit insurance, World Financial Capital Bank must meet specific capital ratios and paid-in capital minimums and must maintain adequate allowances for loan losses. If World Financial Capital Bank fails to meet the terms of the FDICs order, the FDIC may withdraw insurance coverage from World Financial Capital Bank, and the State of Utah may withdraw its approval of World Financial Capital Bank. Under capital adequacy guidelines 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, World Financial Network National Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. World Financial Network National Bank is limited in the amounts that it can pay as dividends to us.
Quantitative measures established by regulations to ensure capital adequacy require World Financial Network National Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. Under the regulations, a well capitalized institution must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6%, a total capital ratio of at least 10% and a leverage ratio of at least 5% and not be subject to a capital directive order. An adequately capitalized institution must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4%, a total capital ratio of at least 8% and a leverage ratio of at least 4%, but 3% is allowed in some cases. Under these guidelines, World Financial Network National Bank is considered well capitalized. As of December31, 2007, World Financial Network National Banks Tier 1 capital ratio was 35.0%, total capital ratio was 36.7% and leverage ratio was 51.6%, and World Financial Network National Bank was not subject to a capital directive order. On April22, 2005, World Financial Capital Bank received non-disapproval notification for a modification of the original three-year business plan. The letter of non-disapproval was issued jointly by the State of Utah and the FDIC. World Financial Capital Bank, under the terms of the letter, must maintain total risk-based capital equal to or exceeding 10% of total risk-based assets and must maintain Tier 1 capital to total assets ratio of not less than 16%. Both capital ratios were maintained at or above the indicated levels until the end of the banks de novo period on November30, 2006.
As part of an acquisition in 2003 by World Financial Network National Bank, which required approval by the OCC, the OCC required World Financial Network National Bank to enter into an operating agreement with the OCC and a capital adequacy and liquidity maintenance agreement with us. The operating agreement requires World Financial Network National Bank to continue to operate in a manner consistent with its current practices, regulatory guidelines and applicable law, including those related to affiliate transactions, maintenance of capital and corporate governance. This operating agreement has not required any changes in World Financial Network National Banks operations. The capital adequacy and liquidity maintenance agreement memorializes our current obligations to World Financial Network National Bank.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No.157). SFAS No.157 establishes a new definition of fair value as well as a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop the assumptions, and requires new disclosures of assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on their level in the hierarchy. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. In December2007, the FASB proposed a one-year deferral for non-financial assets and liabilities to comply with SFAS No.157. We are currently in the process of evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS No.157 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.159, Establishing the Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities (SFAS No.159), to permit all entities to choose to elect to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value. SFAS No.159 applies to fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, with early adoption permitted for an entity that has also elected to apply the provisions of SFAS No.157. An entity is prohibited from retrospectively applying SFAS No.159, unless it chooses early adoption. We are currently in the process of evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS No.159 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
In December2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.141 (revised 2007) (SFASNo. 141R), Business Combinations and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.160 Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements No.51 (SFASNo. 160). SFASNo. 141R will change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods. SFASNo. 160 will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. Both statements are required to be adopted for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impact that SFAS No.141R and SFASNo. 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
Item7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. Our primary market risks include off-balance sheet risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and redemption reward risk.
Off-Balance Sheet Risk.
We are subject to off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, including commitments to extend credit and through our securitization program. We sell substantially all of our credit card receivables to the WFN Trusts, qualifying special purpose entities. The trusts enter into interest rate swaps to reduce the interest rate sensitivity of the securitization transactions. The securitization program involves elements of credit, market, interest rate, legal and operational risks in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet through our retained interests in the securitization and the interest-only strips.
Interest Rate Risk.
Interest rate risk affects us directly in our lending and borrowing activities. Our total interest incurred was approximately $248.1 million for 2007, which includes both on-and off-balance sheet transactions. Of this total, $80.2 million of the interest expense for 2007 was attributable to on-balance sheet indebtedness and the remainder to our securitized credit card receivables, which are financed off-balance sheet. To manage our risk from market interest rates, we actively monitor the interest rates and the interest sensitive components both on- and off-balance sheet to minimize the impact that changes in interest rates have on the fair value of assets, net income and cash flow. To achieve this objective, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates by matching asset and liability repricings and through the use of fixed-rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements. In addition, we enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and treasury locks to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt. We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for trading or other speculative purposes. At December31, 2007, we had $4.8 billion of debt, including $3.5 billion of off-balance sheet debt from our securitization program.
As of December31, 2007 Fixed rate Variable rate Total (In millions) Off-balance sheet $ 2,050.0 $ 1,438.4 $ 3,488.4 On-balance sheet 909.5 421.0 1,330.5 Total $ 2,959.5 $ 1,859.4 $ 4,818.9  At December31, 2007, our fixed rate off-balance sheet debt was locked at a current effective interest rate of 4.3% through interest rate swap agreements.
At December31, 2007, our fixed rate on-balance sheet debt was subject to fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5%.
The approach we use to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis which we believe best reflects the risk inherent in our business. This approach calculates the impact on pretax income from an instantaneous and sustained increase in interest rates of 1.0%. In 2007, a 1.0% increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease to fiscal year pretax income of approximately $10.0 million. Conversely, a corresponding decrease in 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements interest rates would have resulted in a comparable increase to pretax income. Our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of financial instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the appropriateness of the related assumptions.
Credit Risk.
We are exposed to credit risk relating to the credit card loans we make to our clients customers. Our credit risk relates to the risk that consumers using the private label credit cards that we issue will not repay their revolving credit card loan balances. We have developed credit risk models designed to identify qualified consumers who fit our risk parameters. To minimize our risk of loan write-offs, we control approval rates of new accounts and related credit limits and follow strict collection practices. We monitor the buying limits, as well as set pricing regarding fees and interest rates charged.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk.
We are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. and the Canadian dollar through our significant Canadian operations. We do not hedge any of our net investment exposure in our Canadian subsidiary. A 1% increase in the Canadian exchange rate would have resulted in an increase in pretax income of $1.2 million. Conversely, a corresponding decrease in the exchange rate would result in a comparable decrease to pretax income.
Redemption Reward Risk.
Through our AIR MILES Reward Program, we are exposed to potentially increasing reward costs associated primarily with travel rewards. To minimize the risk of rising travel reward costs, we:  have multi-year supply agreements with several Canadian, U.S. and international airlines;  are seeking new supply agreements with additional airlines;  periodically alter the total mix of rewards available to collectors with the introduction of new merchandise rewards, which are typically lower cost per AIR MILES reward mile than air travel;  allow collectors to obtain certain travel rewards using a combination of reward miles and cash or cash alone in addition to using AIR MILES reward miles alone; and  periodically adjust the number of AIR MILES reward miles required to be redeemed to obtain a reward.
A 1% increase in the cost of redemptions would have resulted in a decrease in pretax income of $3.0 million. Conversely, a corresponding decrease in the cost of redemptions would result in a comparable increase to pretax income.

Controls and Procedures Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of December31, 2007, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of December31, 2007, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our evaluation of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007 did not include the internal controls of Abacus, because of the timing of the acquisition, which was completed in February 2007. As of December31, 2007, this entity constituted approximately $404.7 million of total assets, $112.2 million of revenues and $9.7 million of net income for the year then ended.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. In conducting this evaluation, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework.
Based on our evaluation and those criteria, our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2007.
During 2007, we completed the process of converting Abacuss legacy general ledger platform to the platform utilized by the majority of our business units. There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter ended December31, 2007 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, has been audited by Deloitte& Touche, LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who also audited our consolidated financial statements. Deloitte& Touches attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting appears on page F-3.

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Alliance Data Systems Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, as of January1, 2006, the Company changed its method of accounting for employee stock-based compensation. As discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, as of January1, 2007, the Company changed its method of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February28, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. As described in our report dated February28, 2008, management excluded from their assessment the internal control over financial reporting of Abacus which was acquired in February 2007; accordingly, our audit of the Companys internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Abacus.
/s/ Deloitte& Touche LLP Dallas, Texas February28, 2008 F-2 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders of Alliance Data Systems Corporation We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Alliance Data Systems Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.As described in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment of the internal control over financial reporting at Abacus, which was acquired in February 2007 and whose financial statements reflect total assets, revenues and net income constituting ten, five and six percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December31, 2007.Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Abacus.The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December31, 2007 of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion and includes an explanatory paragraph regarding the Companys change in its method of accounting for employee stock-based compensation in 2006 and the Companys change in its method of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in 2007, on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.

2. PROPOSED MERGER On May17, 2007, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Aladdin Solutions, Inc. (f/k/a Aladdin Holdco, Inc., Parent), Aladdin Merger Sub, Inc. (Merger Sub) and the Company (the Merger Agreement). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, and as a result the Company will continue as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the Merger). Parent and Merger Sub were formed and are controlled by affiliates of The Blackstone Group. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock of the Company, other than shares owned by the Company, Parent, any subsidiary of the Company or Parent, or by any stockholders who are entitled to and who properly exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $81.75 in cash, without interest. In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that the vesting and/or lapse of restrictions on substantially all stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units will be accelerated at the effective time of the Merger and holders of such securities will receive consideration in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. The Company will also accelerate the recognition of stock compensation expense resulting from the vesting of substantially all outstanding unvested stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units in connection with the Merger. Consummation of the Merger is subject to closing conditions, including conditions relating to regulatory approvals. No assurances can be given that the conditions precedent to consummating the Merger will be satisfied or that the Merger will be consummated.
The Company filed its definitive proxy statement and proxy supplement with the SEC on July5, 2007 and July30, 2007, respectively, soliciting stockholder approval of the Merger Agreement, which was approved at a special meeting of the Companys stockholders on August8, 2007. The Company filed its Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, notification and report forms with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice on June1, 2007 and early termination of the applicable waiting period was granted on June11, 2007. The Company filed a request for an advance ruling certificate (ARC) regarding the Merger under the Competition Act (Canada) with the Canadian Commissioner of Competition on June1, 2007 and received an ARC on June7, 2007. The Company filed a notification under F-8 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) the German Act against Restraints of Competition, as amended with the German Federal Cartel Office on June14, 2007. The waiting period under the German Competition Act expired on July14, 2007. Parent filed the required notices with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on June28, 2007.
Parent also filed the required notices with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions, in each case on July2, 2007.
The Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances, including if the Company has received a superior proposal and the Companys Board of Directors or the special committee of the Companys Board of Directors (the Special Committee) has determined in good faith that the failure to terminate the Merger Agreement would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the Board of Directors or Special Committee and the Company otherwise complies with certain terms of the Merger Agreement. Upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, under specified circumstances, the Company will be required to reimburse Parent and Merger Sub for their transaction expenses up to $20.0 million and under specified circumstances, the Company will be required to pay Parent, or its designee, a termination fee of $170.0 million less any expenses previously reimbursed. Additionally, under specified circumstances, Parent will be required to pay the Company a termination fee of $170.0 million.
On October15, 2007, Merger Sub commenced a tender offer (the Tender Offer) in respect of the Companys $250.0 million aggregate principal amount 6.00% Senior Notes, Series A, due May16, 2009 and the Companys $250.0 million aggregate principal amount 6.14% Senior Notes, Series B, due May16, 2011 (collectively, the Notes). The Tender Offer was conducted concurrently with a related consent solicitation (the Consent Solicitation) to amend the terms of the Notes and the related Note Purchase Agreement dated as of May1, 2006 (the Note Purchase Agreement) to, among other things, eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants and certain events of default and modify or eliminate certain other provisions. On the same date, the Company commenced a cash offer (the Prepayment Offer) in respect of the Notes pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement.
On October22, 2007, the Company entered into an amendment (the Amendment) in respect of the Notes with all of the Holders (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) providing for a mandatory prepayment of all of the Notes on the date that the Merger is consummated, provided that the Merger is consummated no later than January1, 2008. The Notes shall be repaid at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of prepayment and the Make-Whole Amount (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) as determined for the prepayment date in accordance with the terms of the Amendment. The obligation of the Company to prepay the Notes pursuant to the terms of the Amendment is subject to and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Merger on or prior to January1, 2008 and therefore is void and of no further force and effect since the Merger did not close on or prior to that date. In connection with the Amendment, on October23, 2007, Merger Sub withdrew the Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation and the Company withdrew the Prepayment Offer. The early retirement of debt will result in the recognition of unamortized debt issuance costs as well as any premium charges associated with early retirement.
Parent has obtained equity and debt financing commitments for the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the proceeds of which, together with the available cash of the Company, will be sufficient for Parent to pay the aggregate Merger consideration and all related fees and expenses of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Consummation of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition, but is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of the Companys stockholders, which was received on August8, 2007, and regulatory clearance. For more information regarding the Merger, see the Companys definitive proxy statement and proxy supplement filed with the SEC on July5, 2007 and July30, 2007, respectively.
F-9 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) On January25, 2008, Parent informed us in a written notice that it does not anticipate the condition to closing the Merger relating to obtaining approvals from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will be satisfied.
On January30, 2008, the Company filed a lawsuit against Parent and Merger Sub (together, the Merger Entities). The lawsuit, filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, sought specific performance to compel the Merger Entities to comply with its obligations under the Merger Agreement, including its covenants to use reasonable best efforts to obtain required regulatory approvals and to consummate the Merger.
On February8, 2008, the Company filed a motion to dismiss this lawsuit without prejudice in response to the Merger Entities confirmation of its commitment to work to consummate the Merger. The Company is working with the Merger Entities to effect an acceptable solution to the unresolved regulatory issues. There can be no assurance, however, that an acceptable solution will be obtained or that the Merger will be completed.
For the year ended December31, 2007, the Company has recorded merger costs of approximately $12.3 million consisting of investment banking, legal, accounting and other costs associated with the Merger.
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ADSC and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Due from Card Associations and Merchant Settlement Obligations Due from card associations and merchant settlement obligations result from the Companys merchant services and associated settlement activities. Due from card associations is generated from credit and debit card transactions, such as MasterCard, Visa, American Express, and Discover Card at merchant locations. The Company records corresponding settlement obligations for amounts payable to merchants. These accounts are settled with the respective card association or merchant on different days.
Sellers Interest and Credit Card Receivables The majority of our credit card receivables are securitized immediately or shortly after origination. As part of its securitization agreements, the Company is required to retain an interest in the credit card receivables, which is referred to as sellers interest. Sellers interest is carried at fair value and credit card receivables are carried at lower of cost or market less an allowance for doubtful accounts. In its capacity as a servicer of the credit card receivables, the Company receives a servicing fee from the World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust, World Financial Network Credit Card Master Note Trust and World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust III (collectively the WFN Trusts). The Company believes that servicing fees received represent adequate compensation based on the amount currently demanded by the marketplace. Additionally, these fees are the same as would fairly compensate a substitute servicer should one be required and, thus, the Company records neither a servicing asset nor servicing liability.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends, and changes in its customer payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts. Any change in the assumptions used in analyzing a specific account receivable may result in an additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs.
F-10 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Redemption Settlement Assets, Restricted These securities relate to the redemption fund for the AIR MILES Reward Program and are subject to a security interest which is held in trust for the benefit of funding redemptions by collectors. These assets are restricted to funding rewards for the collectors by certain of our sponsor contracts. These securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Debt securities that the Company does not have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as securities available-for-sale.
Property and Equipment Furniture, fixtures, computer equipment and software, and leasehold improvements are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization, including capital leases, are computed on a straight-line basis, using estimated lives ranging from three to 15 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the remaining lives of the respective leases or the remaining useful lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter. Software development (costs to create new platforms for certain of the Companys information systems) and conversion costs (systems, programming and other related costs to allow conversion of new client accounts to the Companys processing systems) are capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1 Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the length of the associated contract or benefit period, which generally ranges from three to five years.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are reviewed at least annually for impairment or more frequently if circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred, using the market comparable and discounted cash flow methods. Separable intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over those useful lives.
The Company also defers costs related to the acquisition or licensing of data for the Companys proprietary databases which are used in providing data products and services to customers. These costs are amortized over the useful life of the data, which is from one to five years.
Revenue Recognition The Companys policy follows the guidance from SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No.104 Revenue Recognition. SAB No.104 provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. The Company recognizes revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been provided to the client, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
Transaction The Company earns transaction fees, which are principally based on the number of transactions processed or statements generated and are recognized as such services are performed. Included are reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses.
Database marketing fees and direct marketing services For maintenance and service programs, revenue is recognized as services are provided. Revenue associated with a new database build is deferred until client acceptance. Upon acceptance, it is then recognized over the term of the related agreement as the services are provided. Revenues from the licensing of data are recognized upon delivery of the data to the customer in circumstances where no update or other obligations exist. Revenue from the licensing of data in which the Company is obligated to provide future updates is recognized on a straight-line basis over the license term.
AIR MILES Reward Program The Company allocates the proceeds received from sponsors for the issuance of AIR MILES reward miles based on relative fair values between the redemption element of the award ultimately provided to the collector (the Redemption element) and the service element (the Service element). The Service element consists of direct marketing and support services provided to sponsors.
F-11 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The fair value of the Service element is based on the estimated fair value of providing the services on a third-party basis. The revenue related to the Service element of the AIR MILES reward miles is initially deferred and amortized over the period of time beginning with the issuance of the AIR MILES reward miles and ending upon their expected redemption (the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile, or 42 months). Revenue associated with the Service element is recorded as part of transaction revenue.
The fair value of the Redemption element of the AIR MILES reward miles issued is determined based on separate pricing offered by the Company as well as other objective evidence. The revenue related to the Redemption element is deferred until the collector redeems the AIR MILES reward miles or over the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile in the case of AIR MILES reward miles that the Company estimates will go unused by the collector base (breakage). The Company currently estimates breakage to be one-third of AIR MILES reward miles issued. There have been no changes to managements estimate of the life of an AIR MILES reward mile or breakage in the periods presented.
Securitization income Securitization income represents gains and losses on securitization of credit card receivables and interest income on sellers interest and credit card receivables held on the balance sheet less a provision for doubtful accounts of $35.8 million, $33.8 million, and $20.9 million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. During 2006, the Company recognized $2.7 million in gains, related to the securitization of new credit card receivables accounted for as sales. No amounts were recognized during 2007 or 2005. The Company records gains or losses on the securitization of credit card receivables on the date of sale based on cash received, the estimated fair value of assets sold and retained, and liabilities incurred in the sale. The anticipated excess cash flow essentially represents an interest-only (I/O) strip, consisting of the excess of finance charges and certain other fees over the sum of the return paid to certificate holders and credit losses over the estimated outstanding period of the receivables. The amount initially allocated to the I/O strip at the date of a securitization reflects the allocated original basis of the relative fair values of those interests. The amount recorded for the I/O strip is reduced for distributions on the I/O strip, which the Company receives from the related trust, fair value gains or losses on interest-only strip, which are recorded through earnings, and is adjusted for mark to market adjustments to the fair value of the I/O strip, which are reflected in other comprehensive income. Because there is not a highly liquid market for these assets, management estimates the fair value of the I/O strip primarily based upon discount, payment and default rates, which is the method we assume that another market participant would use to purchase the I/O strip.
In recording and accounting for the I/O strip, management makes assumptions about rates of payments and defaults, which reflect economic and other relevant conditions that affect fair value. Due to subsequent changes in economic and other relevant conditions, the actual rates of payments and defaults would generally differ from our initial estimates, and these differences could sometimes be material. If actual payment and default rates are higher than previously assumed, the value of the I/O strip could be permanently impaired and the decline in the fair value would be recorded in earnings.
The Company recognizes the implicit forward contract to sell new receivables during a revolving period at its fair value at the time of sale. The implicit forward contract is entered into at the market rate and thus, its initial measure is zero at inception. In addition, the Company does not mark the forward contract to fair value in accounting periods following the securitization as management has concluded that the fair value of the implicit forward contract in subsequent periods is not material.
Finance charges, net Finance charges, net of credit losses, represents revenue earned on customer accounts serviced by the Company, and is recognized in the period in which it is earned.
Securitization Sales The Companys securitization of its credit card receivables involves the sale to a trust and is accomplished primarily through the public and private issuance of asset-backed securities by the special F-12 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) purpose entities. The Company removes credit card receivables from its Consolidated Balance Sheets for those asset securitizations that qualify as sales in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.140 Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities-a replacement of FASB Statement No.125. The Company has determined that the WFN Trusts are qualifying special purpose entities as defined by SFAS No.140, and that all current securitizations qualify as sales.
Taxes assessed on revenue-producing transactions described above are presented on a net basis, and are excluded from revenues.
Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is based only on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, excluding any dilutive effects of options or other dilutive securities. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive common shares (dilutive stock options, unvested restricted stock and other dilutive securities outstanding during the year).
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for the periods indicated: Year Ended December31, 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands, except per share amounts) Numerator Net income available to common stockholders $ 164,061 $ 189,605 $ 138,745 Denominator Weighted average shares, basic 78,403 79,735 82,208 Weighted average effect of dilutive securities: Net effect of dilutive stock options and unvested restricted stock 2,408 1,951 2,429 Denominator for diluted calculation 80,811 81,686 84,637 Basic Net income per share $ 2.09 $ 2.38 $ 1.69 Diluted Net income per share $ 2.03 $ 2.32 $ 1.64 Currency Translation The assets and liabilities of the Companys subsidiaries outside the U.S., primarily Canada, are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet dates. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Gains and losses resulting from currency transactions are recognized currently in income and those resulting from translation of financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Leases Rent expense on operating leases is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement.
Advertising Costs The Company participates in various advertising and marketing programs. The cost of advertising and marketing programs is expensed in the period incurred.

F-13 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Stock Compensation Expense Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of, and accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No.123(R)) which supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No.25). Under the fair value recognition provisions, stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized ratably over the requisite service period. The Company elected the modified prospective method, under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. The valuation provisions of SFAS No.123(R) apply to new grants and to grants that were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified. Estimated compensation for grants that were outstanding as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation expense estimated for the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS No.123) pro forma disclosures, adjusted for forfeitures.
The following table sets forth the pro forma amounts of net income and net income per share, for the year ended December31, 2005 that would have resulted if the Company had accounted for the stock-based awards under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123: Year Ended December31,2005 (In thousands, exceptpershareamounts) Net income, as reported $ 138,745 Add: Stock-based employee compensation expense included in reported net income, net of related tax effects 8,839 Deduct: Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all stock option awards, net of related tax effects (22,849 ) $ 124,735 Net income per share: Basic-as reported $ 1.69 Basic-pro forma $ 1.52 Diluted-as reported $ 1.64 Diluted-pro forma $ 1.47 Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No.157). SFAS No.157 establishes a new definition of fair value as well as a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop the assumptions, and requires new disclosures of assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on their level in the hierarchy. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. In December2007, the FASB proposed a one-year deferral for non-financial assets and liabilities to comply with SFAS No.157. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS No.157 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
F-14 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.159, Establishing the Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities (SFAS No.159), to permit all entities to choose to elect to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value. SFAS No.159 applies to fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, with early adoption permitted for an entity that has also elected to apply the provisions of SFAS No.157. An entity is prohibited from retrospectively applying SFAS No.159, unless it chooses early adoption. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS No.159 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
In December2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.141 (revised 2007) (SFASNo. 141R), Business Combinations and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No.51 (SFASNo. 160). SFASNo. 141R will change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods. SFASNo. 160 will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. Both statements are required to be adopted for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that SFAS No.141R and SFASNo. 160 will have on its consolidated financial statements.

When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the Issuer, and the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time, which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value. The unrealized losses on the Companys investments during 2007 in government and corporate bond securities were caused primarily by changes in interest rates. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities with low probabilities of default. The Company also has the ability to hold the investments until maturity. As of December31, 2007, the Company does not consider the investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.
The net carrying value and estimated fair value of the securities at December31, 2007 by contractual maturity are as follows: Amortized Cost Estimated Fair Value (In thousands) Due in one year or less $ 138,515 $ 138,208 Due after one year through five years 179,883 178,845 Due after five years through ten years   Due after ten years   Total $ 318,398 $ 317,053 6.

Amortization associated with capitalized software development and conversion costs totaled $29.4 million, $19.9 million and $20.3 million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.
F-19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 7. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS During the third quarter of 2007, the Company reviewed one of the customer relationships in its utility services division and determined that certain long-lived assets, including internally developed software, certain customer relationship assets, and other assets, had been impaired. The Company recognized approximately $40.0 million as a non-cash asset write-down, with the impairment charge included in our Transaction Services segment.
8. SECURITIZATION OF CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES The Company regularly securitizes its credit card receivables to the WFN Trusts. During the initial phase of a securitization reinvestment period, the Company generally retains principal collections in exchange for the transfer of additional credit card receivables into the securitized pool of assets. During the amortization or accumulation period of a securitization, the investors share of principal collections (in certain cases, up to a maximum specified amount each month) is either distributed to the investors or held in an account until it accumulates to the total amount due, at which time it is paid to the investors in a lump sum. The Companys outstanding securitizations are scheduled to begin their amortization or accumulation periods at various times between 2008 and 2012 and thereafter.
The following table shows the maturities of borrowing commitments as of December31, 2007 for the WFN Trusts by year: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 &Thereafter Total (In thousands) Public notes $ 600,000 $ 500,000 $  $ 450,000 $ 500,000 $ 2,050,000 Private conduits (1) 2,085,714     2,085,714 Total $ 2,685,714 $ 500,000 $  $ 450,000 $ 500,000 $ 4,135,714 (1) Represents borrowing capacity, not outstanding borrowings. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we renewed and amended $1,085.7 million of our $2,085.7 million private conduits under similar terms.
Sellers interest and credit card receivables, less allowance for doubtful accounts consists of: December31, 2007 2006 (In thousands) Sellers interest $ 217,054 $ 253,170 Credit card receivables 451,862 338,864 Other receivables 22,244 23,274 Allowance (38,726 ) (45,919 ) $ 652,434 $ 569,389 Due from securitizations consists of: December31, 2007 2006 (In thousands) Spread deposits $ 125,624 $ 128,787 I/O strips 154,735 110,060 Residual interest in securitization trust 69,189 82,110 Excess funding deposits 29,720 4,500 $ 379,268 $ 325,457 F-20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The Company is required to maintain minimum interests ranging from 4% to 10% of the securitized credit card receivables. This requirement is met through sellers interest and is supplemented through the excess funding deposits. Excess funding deposits represent cash amounts deposited with the trustee of the securitizations. Residual interest in securitization represents a subordinated interest in the cash flows of the WFN Trusts.
The spread deposits and I/O strips are initially recorded at their allocated carrying amount based on relative fair value. Fair value is determined by computing the present value of the estimated cash flows, using the dates that such cash flows are expected to be released to the Company, at a discount rate considered to be commensurate with the risks associated with the cash flows. The amounts and timing of the cash flows are estimated after considering various economic factors including payment rates, delinquency, default and loss assumptions. I/O strips, sellers interest and other interests retained are periodically evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of those assets.
Fair values of I/O strips and other interests retained are based on a review of actual cash flows and on the factors that affect the amounts and timing of the cash flows from each of the underlying credit card receivable pools. Based on this analysis, assumptions are validated or revised as deemed necessary, the amounts and the timing of anticipated cash flows are estimated and fair value is determined. The Company has one collateral type, private label retail card receivables.
At December31, 2007, key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to an immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in the assumptions are as follows: Assumptions ImpactonFair Value of10%Change ImpactonFair Value of20%Change (In thousands) Fair value of I/O strip $ 154,735 Weighted average life 8.5months Discount rate 10.5 % $ (477 ) $ (949 ) Expected yield, net of dilution 18.8 % (32,235 ) (64,467 ) Interest expense 4.8 % (2,197 ) (4,394 ) Net charge-offs rate 6.7 % (8,471 ) (16,669 ) These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the figures indicate, changes in fair value based on a 10 percent variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in an assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in this table the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption; in practice, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities.
Spread deposits, carried at estimated fair value, represent deposits that are held by a trustee or agent and are used to absorb shortfalls in the available net cash flows related to securitized credit card receivables if those available net cash flows are insufficient to satisfy certain obligations of the WFN Trusts. The fair value of spread deposits is based on the weighted average life of the underlying securities and the discount rate. The discount rate is based on a risk adjusted rate paid on the series. The amount required to be deposited is approximately 3.8% of the investors interest in the WFN Trusts. Spread deposits are generally released proportionately as investors are repaid, although some spread deposits are released only when investors have been paid in full. None of these spread deposits were required to be used to cover losses on securitized credit card receivables in the three-year period ended December31, 2007.

Interest is paid monthly and at maturity.
Credit Facility As of December31, 2007, the Company maintained a consolidated credit agreement that provides for a $540.0 million revolving credit facility with a U.S. $50.0 million sublimit for Canadian dollar borrowings and a $50.0 million sublimit for swing line loans (the consolidated credit facility). At December31, 2007, borrowings under the consolidated credit facility were $121.0 million and had a weighted average interest rate of 7.1%.
Additionally, the consolidated credit facility includes an accordion feature of up to $210.0 million in the aggregate allowing for future incremental borrowings, subject to certain conditions. The consolidated credit facility is unsecured. Each of ADS Alliance Data Systems, Inc., Alliance Data Foreign Holdings, Inc., Epsilon Marketing Services, LLC and Epsilon Data Management, LLC are guarantors under the consolidated credit facility. On March30, 2007, the Company amended the consolidated credit facility to extend the lending commitments that were scheduled to terminate on September29, 2011 to March30, 2012. In addition, the amendment adjusts the Senior Leverage Ratio applicable to the various levels set forth in the consolidated credit facility and the margin applicable to Eurodollar loans to those reflected below.
Advances under the consolidated credit facility are in the form of either base rate loans or eurodollar loans and may be denominated in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars. The interest rate for base rate loans denominated in U.S. dollars fluctuates and is equal to the higher of (1)the Bank of Montreals prime rate and (2)the Federal funds rate plus 0.5%, in either case with no additional margin. The interest rate for base rate loans denominated in Canadian dollars fluctuates and is equal to the higher of (1)the Bank of Montreals prime rate for Canadian dollar loans and (2)the CDOR rate plus 1%, in either case with no additional margin. The interest rate for eurodollar loans denominated in U.S. or Canadian dollars fluctuates based on the rate at which deposits of U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars, respectively, in the London interbank market are quoted plus a margin of 0.4% to 0.8% based upon the Companys Senior Leverage Ratio as defined in the consolidated credit facility. Among other fees, the Company pays a facility fee of 0.1% to 0.2%per annum (due quarterly) on the aggregate commitments under the consolidated credit facility, whether used or unused, based upon the Companys Senior F-25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Leverage Ratio as defined in the consolidated credit facility. The Company will also pay fees with respect to any letters of credit issued under the consolidated credit facility.
The consolidated credit facility includes usual and customary negative covenants for credit agreements of this type, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the Companys ability, and in certain instances, its subsidiaries ability, to consolidate or merge; substantially change the nature of its business; sell, transfer or dispose of assets; create or incur indebtedness; create liens; pay dividends and repurchase stock; and make investments. The negative covenants are subject to certain exceptions, as specified in the consolidated credit facility. The consolidated credit facility also requires the Company to satisfy certain financial covenants, including maximum ratios of Total Capitalization and Senior Leverage as determined in accordance with the consolidated credit facility and a minimum ratio of Consolidated Operating EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense as determined in accordance with the consolidated credit facility.
The consolidated credit facility also includes customary events of default, including, among other things, payment default, covenant default, breach of representation or warranty, bankruptcy, cross-default, material ERISA events, a change of control of the Company, material money judgments and failure to maintain subsidiary guarantees. As of December31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with its covenants under the consolidated credit facility.
Bridge Loan On January24, 2007, the Company entered into a credit facility, (the bridge loan) which provides for loans up to $400.0 million. At the closing of the bridge loan, the Company borrowed $300.0 million for general corporate purposes including the repayment of debt and the financing of permitted acquisitions. The bridge loan included an uncommitted accordion feature of up to $100.0 million allowing for future borrowings, subject to certain conditions. The bridge loan is unsecured. Each of ADS Alliance Data Systems, Inc., Alliance Data Foreign Holdings, Inc., Epsilon Marketing Services, LLC and Epsilon Data Management, LLC are guarantors under the bridge loan. At December31, 2007, borrowings under the bridge loan were $300.0million at a weighted average interest rate of 7.3%.
On July6, 2007, the Company entered into a first amendment to the bridge loan to extend the maturity date from July24, 2007 to December31, 2007. On December21, 2007, the Company entered into a second amendment to the bridge loan which extended the maturity date from December31, 2007 to March31, 2008 and eliminated the uncommitted accordion feature, which had allowed for future borrowings up to $100.0 million, subject to certain conditions. In addition, the second amendment adjusts the margin applicable to base rate loans and Eurodollar loans to those set forth below. The Company anticipates renewing or refinancing the bridge loan prior to March31, 2008.
The interest rate for base rate loans fluctuates and is equal to the higher of (A)the Bank of Montreals prime rate and (B)the Federal funds rate plus 0.5% plus a margin of (1)0.0% to 0.2% for the period from January1 to January31, 2008; (2)0.0% to 0.45% for the period from February1 to February29, 2008; and (3)0.1% to 0.70% for the period from March1 to March31, 2008, based upon our Senior Leverage Ratio as defined in the bridge loan. The interest rate for Eurodollar loans fluctuates based on the London interbank offered rate plus a margin of (1)1.1% to 1.7% for the period from January1 to January31, 2008; (2)1.35% to 1.95% for the period from February1 to February29, 2008; and (3)1.6% to 2.2% for the period from March1 to March31, 2008, based upon our Senior Leverage Ratio as defined in the bridge loan.
The bridge loan contains usual and customary negative covenants for transactions of this type, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the Companys ability, and in certain instances, its subsidiaries ability, to consolidate or merge; substantially change the nature of its business; sell, transfer or dispose of assets; create or F-26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) incur indebtedness; create liens; pay dividends and repurchase stock; and make investments. The negative covenants are subject to certain exceptions, as specified in the bridge loan. The bridge loan also requires the Company to satisfy certain financial covenants, including maximum ratios of Total Capitalization and Senior Leverage as determined in accordance with the bridge loan and a minimum ratio of Consolidated Operating EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense as determined in accordance with the bridge loan. The bridge loan must be prepaid prior to the scheduled maturity date if the Company or any of its subsidiaries issues any debt or equity securities, subject to certain exceptions. The bridge loan also includes customary events of default, including, among other things, payment default, covenant default, breach of representation or warranty, bankruptcy, cross-default, material ERISA events, a change of control, material money judgments and failure to maintain subsidiary guarantees. As of December31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with its covenants under the bridge loan.
If the Merger is consummated, as described in Note 2, the Company plans to repay in full and terminate the credit facility and the bridge loan with the proceeds of the equity and debt financing commitments obtained by Parent and Merger Sub. For more information regarding the Merger, see the Companys definitive proxy statement and proxy supplement filed with the SEC on July5, 2007 and July30, 2007, respectively.
Senior Notes On May16, 2006, the Company entered into a senior note purchase agreement and issued and sold $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Series A Notes due May16, 2009 and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.14% Series B Notes due May16, 2011. The Series A and Series B Notes will accrue interest on the unpaid balance thereof at the rate of 6.00% and 6.14%per annum, respectively, from May16, 2006, payable semiannually, on May16 and November16 in each year, commencing with November16, 2006, until the principal has become due and payable. The note purchase agreement includes usual and customary negative covenants and events of default for transactions of this type. The senior notes are unsecured. The payment obligations under the senior notes are guaranteed by certain of the Companys existing and future subsidiaries, originally ADS Alliance Data Systems, Inc. Due to their status as guarantors under the consolidated credit facility and pursuant to a Joinder to Subsidiary Guaranty dated as of September29, 2006, three additional subsidiaries of the Company became guarantors of the senior notes, including Alliance Data Foreign Holdings, Inc., Epsilon Marketing Services, LLC and Epsilon Data Management, LLC. As of December31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with its covenants.
On October22, 2007, the Company entered into an amendment in respect of the note purchase agreement with all of the Holders (as defined in the note purchase agreement) providing for a mandatory prepayment of all of the notes on the date that the Merger is consummated. The Notes would be repaid at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of prepayment and the Make-Whole Amount (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) as determined for the prepayment date in accordance with the terms of the amendment. The obligation of the Company to prepay the Notes pursuant to the terms of the amendment was subject to and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Merger on our prior to January1, 2008 and therefore is void and of no further force and effect since the Merger did not close on or prior to that date.
Other The Company has other minor borrowings, primarily capital leases, with varying interest rates.

Pursuant to Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Companys utilization of such NOLs and approximately $2.0 million of tax credits are subject to an annual limitation. The Company believes it is more likely than not that a portion of the federal NOLs and credits will expire before being utilized. Therefore, in accordance with FAS No.109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No.109), the Company has established a valuation allowance on the portion of NOLs and credits that the Company expects to expire prior to utilization. The Company also believes it is more likely than not that a portion of the credits and capital losses not subject to Section382 limitations will expire before being utilized. Therefore, in accordance with SFAS No.109, the Company has established a valuation allowance against the portion of these credits and capital losses that are expected to expire prior to utilization.
At December31, 2007, the Company has state income tax NOLs of approximately $460 million and state credits of approximately $7.1 million available to offset future state taxable income. The state NOLs and credits will expire at various times through the year 2027. The Company believes it is more likely than not that a portion of the state NOLs and credits will expire before being utilized. Therefore, in accordance with SFAS No.109, the Company has established a valuation allowance on the portion of NOLs and credits that the Company expects to expire prior to utilization.
At December31, 2007, the Company has foreign income tax NOLs of approximately $5.5 million and capital losses of approximately $8.5 million, which expire at various times through the year 2017. The Company F-29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) believes it is more likely than not that capital gains will not be generated to utilize the capital losses in the foreseeable future. Therefore, in accordance with SFAS No.109, the Company has established a valuation allowance against the entire capital loss.
As of December31, 2007, the Companys valuation allowance has increased, which is primarily attributable to the recording of various tax credits and carryforwards, a portion of which the Company believes it is more likely than not will expire prior to utilization.
The Company has unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $138.0 million. A deferred tax liability has not been established on the unremitted earnings, as it is managements intention to permanently reinvest those earnings in foreign jurisdictions. If a portion were to be remitted, management believes income tax credits would substantially offset any resulting tax liability.
Of the total tax benefits resulting from the exercise of employee stock options and other employee stock programs, the amounts recorded to stockholders equity were approximately $8.2 million, $17.5 million and $13.6 million for the years ended 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
The Canadian government has enacted laws that reduce the income tax rates for years beginning in 2008. The first of these laws was enacted in June 2006 and another was enacted in December 2007. As a result of these rate reductions, the Company was required to book additional expense to reduce the net deferred tax asset in Canada related to the future lower income tax rates. The Company recorded $5.4 million and $3.3 million of income tax expense for the years ended 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to the June 2006 rate reduction. The Company recorded $5.3 million in 2007 related to the December 2007 rate reduction.
On January1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No.48 (FIN No.48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. As a result of the implementation of FIN No.48, the Company recognized an increase of approximately $8.8 million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as a reduction to retained earnings. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (In thousands): Balance at January1, 2007 $ 56,096 Increases related to prior years tax positions 1,619 Decreases related to prior years tax positions (3,559 ) Increases related to current year tax positions 7,745 Settlements during the period 1,756 Lapses of applicable statute of limitations (823 ) Balance at December31, 2007 $ 62,834 Included in the balance at December31, 2007 are tax positions reclassified from deferred tax liabilities. Deductibility is highly certain for these tax positions but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period.
The Company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. As of December31, 2007, the Company has potential cumulative interest and penalties with respect to unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $19 million. For the year ended December31, 2007, the Company recognized approximately $3.7 million, in potential interest and penalties with respect to unrecognized tax benefits.
F-30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) If recognized at some point in the future, the unrecognized tax benefits would favorably impact the effective tax rate by approximately $35 million. The Company does not anticipate a significant change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States Federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the tax returns filed by the Company are no longer subject to United States Federal or state and local income tax examinations for years before 2004 and are no longer subject to foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2003.
14. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY On June8, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program to acquire up to an aggregate of $80.0 million of its outstanding common stock through June 2006. On October27, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a second stock repurchase program to acquire up to an additional $220.0 million of its outstanding common stock through October 2006.
On September28, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a third stock repurchase program to acquire up to an additional $600.0 million of its outstanding common stock through December 2008, in addition to any amount remaining available at the expiration of the second stock repurchase program.
Under the plans, the Company has acquired 1,805,800, 2,857,672, and 3,942,100 shares for approximately $108.5 million, $146.0 million and $148.8 million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Per the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company agreed that from May17, 2007 until the effective time of the Merger or the expiration or termination of the Merger Agreement, with certain exceptions, the Company would not purchase any of our capital stock, which includes suspension of any repurchases under the third stock repurchase program or otherwise. From May17, 2007 through December31, 2007, the Company has not purchased any additional shares under the third stock repurchase program.
15. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS The Company has adopted equity compensation plans to advance the interests of the Company by rewarding certain employees for their contributions to the financial success of the Company and thereby motivating them to continue to make such contributions in the future.
On April4, 2003, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the 2003 long term incentive plan and the stockholders approved it at the Companys 2003 annual meeting of stockholders on June10, 2003. This plan reserves 6,000,000 shares of common stock for grants of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards and performance shares to officers, employees, non-employee directors and consultants performing services for the Company or its affiliates.
On March31, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the 2005 long-term incentive plan. On June7, 2005, at the annual meeting of stockholders, the stockholders approved and adopted the Companys 2005 long term incentive plan, effective July1, 2005. This plan reserves 4,750,000 shares of common stock for grants of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance shares to officers, employees, non-employee directors and consultants performing services for the Company or its affiliates.
F-31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Terms of all awards under both the 2003 long-term incentive plan and the 2005 long-term incentive plan are determined by the Board of Directors or the compensation committee of the Board of Directors or its designee at the time of award.
Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of, and accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with, SFAS No.123(R) which supersedes APB No.25. Under the fair value recognition provisions, stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized ratably over the requisite service period. The Company elected the modified prospective method, under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. The valuation provisions of SFAS No.123(R) apply to new grants and to grants that were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified. Estimated compensation for grants that were outstanding as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation expense estimated under SFAS No.123 pro forma disclosures, adjusted for forfeitures.
Total stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Companys consolidated statements of income for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, is as follows: Year Ended December31, 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Cost of operations $ 35,015 $ 26,982 $  General and administrative 21,228 16,071 14,143 Total $ 56,243 $ 43,053 $ 14,143 As the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount recognized in the Companys results of operations has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS No.123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on the Companys historical experience. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No.123(R), the Company accounted for forfeitures as they occurred in accordance with APB No.25 and did not estimate forfeitures. As of December 31, 2007, there was approximately $38.9 million of unrecognized expense, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, related to non-vested, stock-based equity awards granted to employees, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.8 years.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS No.123(R), the Company accounted for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB No.25. Under the intrinsic value method, stock-based compensation expense for employee stock options was not recognized in the Companys results of operations as the exercise price equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the Companys prior year financial statements have not been restated to reflect the impact of the adoption of SFAS No.123(R).
Restricted Stock During 2007, the Company has awarded both service-based and performance-based restricted stock units. Fair value of the restricted stock is estimated on the date of grant. In accordance with SFAS No.123(R), the Company recognizes the estimated stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the applicable service period.
F-32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Service-based restricted stock awards typically vest ratably over a three year period. Performance-based restricted stock awards vest if specified performance measures tied to the Companys financial performance are met.

The shares vest immediately, but are subject to transfer restrictions until one year after the directors service on the Board terminates.
(2) Includes 86,314 performance based restricted stock awarded in 2006, for which the performance criteria was met and vested in 2007.
The weighted average grant-date fair value per share was $65.21 for restricted stock awards granted for the year ended December31, 2007.
Stock Options Stock option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Companys stock on the date of grant. Options typically vest ratably over three years and expire ten years after the date of grant. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial lattice model. The following table indicates the assumptions used in estimating fair value for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.
Year Ended December31, 2007 2006 2005 Expected dividend yield    Risk-free interest rate 4.51%-4.99% 4.53%-4.65% 2.94%-4.76% Expected life of options (years) 6.8 7.1 6.4 Assumed volatility 31.8%-35.7% 31.9%-37.0% 28.8%-43.6% Weighted average fair value $26.15 $18.46 $16.60 F-33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The following table summarizes stock option activity under the Companys equity compensation plans: Outstanding Exercisable Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Options Weighted Average Exercise Price (In thousands, except per share amounts) Balance at January1, 2005 6,615 $ 21.33 Granted 2,102 41.00 Exercised (1,506 ) 17.86 Cancelled (531 ) 32.80 Balance at December31, 2005 6,680 $ 27.19 3,319 $ 18.01 Granted 620 43.44 Exercised (2,053 ) 21.57 Cancelled (375 ) 29.96 Balance at December31, 2006 4,872 $ 30.98 2,697 $ 23.80 Granted 433 63.33 Exercised (618 ) 29.94 Cancelled (81 ) 40.92 Balance at December31, 2007 4,606 $ 33.98 3,327 $ 28.19 At December31, 2007 Vested or Expected to Vest 4,193 $ 32.73 Based on the market value on their respective exercise dates, the total intrinsic value of options exercised during the year ended December31, 2007 was approximately $22.6 million.
The following table summarizes information concerning currently outstanding and exercisable stock options at December31, 2007: Outstanding Exercisable Options Remaining Contractual Life (Years) Weighted Average Exercise Price Options Weighted Average Exercise Price (In thousands, except per share amounts) $9.00 to $12.00 421 3.0 $ 11.57 421 $ 11.57 $12.01 to $15.00 579 2.9 $ 14.97 579 $ 14.97 $15.01 to $22.00 18 4.9 $ 19.79 18 $ 19.79 $22.01 to $29.00 509 5.5 $ 24.05 509 $ 24.05 $29.01 to $39.00 779 6.3 $ 31.95 754 $ 31.80 $39.01 to $47.00 1,857 7.4 $ 41.79 1,030 $ 41.54 $47.01 to $54.00 19 8.4 $ 53.34 13 $ 53.40 $54.01 to $64.00 424 9.1 $ 63.33 3 $ 63.35 4,606 3,327 The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding as of December31, 2007 was approximately $188.9 million. For those options outstanding and exercisable which are expected to vest as of December31, 2007 the aggregate intrinsic value was approximately $177.2 million and $150.4 million, respectively, with a weighted F-34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) average remaining contractual life of 6.0 years and 5.4 years, respectively. The number of options outstanding and expected to vest is impacted by our forfeiture rate assumptions.
During 2007, the vesting provisions of 186,257 shares of restricted stock and stock options issued to 44 employees were modified. The service conditions of these awards were accelerated in connection with the anticipation of termination and the termination of these employees. The terms were modified such that should the Merger, as discussed in Note 2, be completed before the Merger Agreement expires or is otherwise terminated, the employee would then receive the consideration as set forth in the Merger Agreement. As a result of the modification, the Company recorded incremental stock-based compensation expense of approximately $7.9 million. Additionally, in connection with the sale of our Mail Services division, the vesting provisions of the awards for 25 employees associated with the division were accelerated on the date of sale, and the Company recorded an incremental stock-based compensation expense of approximately $1.8 million.
As discussed in Note 2, vesting of substantially all of the Companys stock options, restricted stock awards, and restricted stock units will be accelerated upon closing of the Merger. In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Staff Position No. FAS 123(R)-4, Classification of Options and Similar Instruments Issued as Employee Compensation That Allow for Cash Settlement upon Occurrence of a Contingent Event (FSP FAS 123(R)-4). FASB Staff Position FSP FAS 123(R)-4 amends SFAS No.123(R) to require evaluation of the probability of occurrence of a contingent cash settlement event in determining whether the underlying options or similar instruments issued as employee compensation should be classified as liabilities or equity. On the date the contingent event becomes probable of occurring the award must be recognized as a liability. On that date, the company recognizes a share-based liability equal to the portion of the award attributed to past service and any provision for accelerated vesting, multiplied by the fair value of the award on that date. The Merger described in Note 2 is the contingent event that would result in cash settlement of the Companys outstanding stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units.
The Company does not believe the Merger is considered probable under FSP FAS 123(R)-4 as of December31, 2007.
16. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS On June7, 2005, at the annual meeting of stockholders, the stockholders approved and adopted the Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP), effective on July1, 2005. No employee may purchase more than $25,000 in stock under the ESPP in any calendar year, and no employee may purchase stock under the ESPP if such purchase would cause the employee to own more than 5% of the voting power or value of the Companys common stock. The ESPP provides for three month offering periods, commencing on the first trading day of each calendar quarter and ending on the last trading day of each calendar quarter. The purchase price of the common stock upon exercise shall be 85% of the fair market value of shares on the applicable purchase date as determined by averaging the high and low trading prices of the last trading day of each quarter. An employee may elect to pay the purchase price of such common stock through payroll deductions. The maximum number of shares that were reserved for issuance under the ESPP is 1,500,000 shares, and subject to adjustment as provided in the ESPP. Employees are required to hold any stock purchased through the ESPP for 180 days prior to any sale or withdrawal of shares. Approximately 687,655 shares of common stock have been purchased under the plan since its adoption, with approximately 41,226 shares purchased in 2007. In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, as of June29, 2007, the ESPP was closed to further contributions.
F-35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) On June7, 2005, the stockholders, at the annual meeting of stockholders, approved the Executive Annual Incentive Plan. Under the plan, the Company may grant to each eligible employee, including executive officers and other key employees, incentive awards to receive cash upon the achievement of pre-established performance goals. No participant may be granted performance awards in excess of $5.0 million in any calendar year.
The Company maintains a 401(k) retirement savings plan, which covers all eligible U.S. employees. Participants can, in accordance with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidelines, set aside both pre-and post-tax savings in this account. In addition to an employees savings, the Company contributes to plan participants accounts. The Alliance 401(k) and Retirement Savings Plan was amended effective January1, 2004 to better benefit the majority of Company employees. The plan is an IRS-approved safe harbor plan design that eliminates the need for most discrimination testing.
Eligible employees can participate in the plan immediately upon joining the Company and after six months of employment begin receiving Company matching contributions. On the first three percent of savings, the Company matches dollar-for-dollar. An additional fifty cents for each dollar an employee contributes is matched for savings of more than three percent and up to five percent of pay. All Company matching contributions are immediately vested. In addition to the Company match, the Company annually may make an additional contribution based on the profitability of the Company. This contribution, subject to Board of Directors approval, is based on a percentage of pay and is subject to a five year vesting schedule. The participants in the plan can direct their contributions and the Companys matching contribution to nine investment options, including the Companys common stock. Company contributions for employees age 65 or older vest immediately. Contributions for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $18.1 million, $15.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively.
The Company also provides a Deferred Profit Sharing Plan for its Canadian employees after one year of service. Company contributions range from one to five percent of earnings, based on years of service.
The Company also maintains an Executive Deferred Compensation Plan. The Executive Deferred Compensation Plan provides an opportunity for a select group of management and highly compensated employees to defer on a pre-tax basis a portion of their regular compensation and bonuses payable for services rendered and to receive certain employer contributions.
17. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME The components of comprehensive income, net of tax effect, are as follows: Year Ended December31, 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net income 164,061 189,605 138,745 Unrealized gain on securities available-for-sale 846 1,880 414 Foreign currency translation adjustments (1) 13,946 (721 ) 3,205 Total accumulated other comprehensive income $ 178,853 $ 190,764 $ 142,364 (1) Primarily related to the impact of changes in the Canadian currency exchange rate.
F-36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The components of accumulated other comprehensive income are as follows: YearEndedDecember31, 2007 2006 (In thousands) Unrealized gain on securities available-for-sale $ 6,237 $ 5,391 Unrealized foreign currency gain 17,803 3,857 Total comprehensive income $ 24,040 $ 9,248 18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES AIR MILES Reward Program The Company has entered into contractual arrangements with certain AIR MILES sponsors that result in fees being billed to those sponsors upon the redemption of reward miles issued by those sponsors. The Company has obtained letters of credit and other assurances from those sponsors for the Companys benefit that expire at various dates. These letters of credit totaled $146.2 million at December31, 2007, which exceeds the amount of the Companys estimate of its obligation to provide travel and other rewards upon the redemption of the reward miles issued by those sponsors.
The Company currently has an obligation to provide collectors with travel and other rewards upon the redemption of AIR MILES reward miles. The Company believes that the redemption settlements assets, including the letters of credit and other assurances mentioned above, are sufficient to meet that obligation.
The Company has entered into certain long-term arrangements to purchase tickets from airlines and other suppliers in connection with redemptions under the AIR MILES Reward Program. These long-term arrangements allow the Company to make purchases at set prices. Under these agreements, the Company is required to purchase annual minimums of approximately $35.3 million.
Leases The Company leases certain office facilities and equipment under noncancellable operating leases and is generally responsible for property taxes and insurance related to such facilities. Lease expense was $57.4 million, $50.2 million and $45.9 million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.
In December 2007, the Company entered into certain sales-lease back transactions which resulted in proceeds of approximately $25.9 million and a deferred gain of $10.8 million. The leases have been reflected as capital lease obligations and the gain amortized over the expected lease term in proportion to the leased assets.
F-37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Future annual minimum rental payments required under noncancellable operating and capital leases, some of which contain renewal options, as of December31, 2007, are: Year Operating Leases Capital Leases (In thousands) 2008 $ 55,013 $ 18,030 2009 46,474 13,062 2010 36,258 11,774 2011 28,394 466 2012 25,113  Thereafter 89,224  Total $ 280,476 43,332 Less amount representing interest (4,227 ) Total present value of minimum lease payments $ 39,105 Regulatory Matters WFNNB is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Companys financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, WFNNB must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.
Before WFNNB can pay dividends to ADSC, it must obtain prior regulatory approval if all dividends declared in any calendar year would exceed its net profits for that year plus its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any transfers to surplus. In addition, WFNNB may only pay dividends to the extent that retained net profits, including the portion transferred to surplus, exceed bad debts. Moreover, to pay any dividend, WFNNB must maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. Further, if a regulatory authority believes that WFNNB is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound banking practice, which, depending on its financial condition, could include the payment of dividends, the authority may require, after notice and hearing, that WFNNB cease and desist from the unsafe practice.
Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require WFNNB to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk weighted assets (as defined) and of Tier 1 capital to average assets (as defined) (total capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio and leverage ratio, respectively). Under the regulations, a well capitalized institution must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6%, a total capital ratio of at least 10% and a leverage ratio of at least 5% and not be subject to a capital directive order. An adequately capitalized institution must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4%, a total capital ratio of at least 8% and a leverage ratio of at least 4%, but 3% is allowed in some cases. Under these guidelines, WFNNB is considered well capitalized. As of December31, 2007, WFNNBs Tier 1 capital ratio was 35.0%, total capital ratio was 36.7% and leverage ratio was 51.6%, and WFNNB was not subject to a capital directive order.
The Companys industrial bank, World Financial Capital Bank, is authorized to do business by the State of Utah and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. World Financial Capital Bank is subject to capital ratios F-38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) and paid-in capital minimums and must maintain adequate allowances for loan losses. While the consequence of losing the World Financial Capital Bank authority to do business would be significant, the Company believes that the risk of such loss is minimal as a result of the precautions it has taken and the management team it has in place.
As part of an acquisition in 2003 by World Financial Network National Bank, which required approval by the OCC, the OCC required World Financial Network National Bank to enter into an operating agreement with the OCC and a capital adequacy and liquidity maintenance agreement with the Company. The operating agreement requires World Financial Network National Bank to continue to operate in a manner consistent with its current practices, regulatory guidelines and applicable law, including those related to affiliate transactions, maintenance of capital and corporate governance. This operating agreement has not required any changes in World Financial Network National Banks operations. The capital adequacy and liquidity maintenance agreement memorializes the Companys current obligations to World Financial Network National Bank.
If either of the Companys depository institution subsidiaries, World Financial Network National Bank or World Financial Capital Bank, failed to meet the criteria for the exemption from the definition of bank in the Bank Holding Company Act under which it operates, and if the Company did not divest such depository institution upon such an occurrence, the Company would become subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act. This would require the Company to cease certain activities that are not permissible for companies that are subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act.
Cardholders The Companys Credit Services segment is active in originating private label and co-branded credit cards in the United States. The Company reviews each potential customers credit application and evaluates the applicants financial history and ability and perceived willingness to repay. Credit card loans are made primarily on an unsecured basis. Cardholders reside throughout the United States and are not significantly concentrated in any one area.
Holders of credit cards issued by the Company have available lines of credit, which vary by cardholders that can be used for purchases of merchandise offered for sale by clients of the Company. These lines of credit represent elements of risk in excess of the amount recognized in the financial statements. The lines of credit are subject to change or cancellation by the Company. As of December31, 2007, the Company had approximately 27.5million cardholders, having unused lines of credit averaging $1,103 per account.
Legal Proceedings The Company is aware of litigation arising from what were originally four lawsuits filed against the Company and its directors in connection with the Merger. On May18, 2007, Sherryl Halpern filed a putative class action (cause no. 07-04689) on behalf of Company stockholders in the 68th Judicial District of Dallas County, Texas against the Company, all of its directors and The Blackstone Group (the Halpern Petition). On May21, 2007, Levy Investments, Ltd. (Levy) filed a purported derivative lawsuit (cause no. 219-01742-07) on behalf of the Company in the 219th Judicial District of Collin County, Texas against all of the Companys directors and The Blackstone Group (the Levy Petition) (this suit was subsequently transferred to the 296th Judicial District of Collin County, Texas and assumed the cause no. 296-01742-07). On May29, 2007, Linda Levine filed a putative class action (cause no. 07-05009) on behalf of Company stockholders in the 192nd Judicial District of Dallas County, Texas against the Company and all of its directors (the Levine Petition). On May31, 2007, the J&V Charitable Remainder Trust filed a putative class action (cause no. 07-05127-F) on F-39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) behalf of Company stockholders in the 116th Judicial District of Dallas County, Texas against the Company, all of its directors and The Blackstone Group (the J&V Petition).
The three putative class actions were consolidated in the 68th Judicial District Court of Dallas County, Texas (the Court) under the caption In re Alliance Data Corp. Class Action Litigation, No.07-04689. On July16, 2007, a consolidated class action petition was filed seeking a declaration that the action was a proper class action, an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining the Merger, a declaration that the director defendants breached their fiduciary duties and an award of fees, expenses and costs. The Company and its directors filed general denials in response to the putative class actions.
The derivative action filed by Levy was voluntarily dismissed and refiled in Dallas County (cause no. 07-06794), and was subsequently transferred to the Court. On July18, 2007, Levy filed an amended derivative petition seeking an injunction preventing consummation of the Merger, an order directing the director defendants to exercise their fiduciary duties to obtain a transaction beneficial to the Company and its stockholders, a declaration that the Merger Agreement was entered into in breach of the director defendants fiduciary duties and is unlawful and unenforceable, an order rescinding the Merger Agreement, the imposition of a constructive trust upon any benefits improperly received by the director defendants and an award of costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys and experts fees. On July24, 2007, the Company and its directors filed their Motion to Abate, Plea to the Jurisdiction and Special Exceptions to the derivative action.
On July12, 2007, class plaintiffs filed a motion to enjoin the scheduled August8, 2007 special meeting of stockholders at which stockholders would be asked to vote to adopt the Merger Agreement. On July20, 2007, Levy filed a motion reflecting its similar demand. On July27, 2007, the Company and its directors filed an opposition brief to both motions. The Company continued to deny all of the allegations in the consolidated class action petition and the amended derivative petition, contended that the asserted claims were baseless and strongly believed that its disclosures in the Companys definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on July5, 2007 (the Definitive Proxy) were appropriate and adequate under applicable law. Nevertheless, in order to lessen the risk of any delay of the closing of the Merger as a result of the litigation, the Company made available to its stockholders certain additional information in connection with the Merger, which was filed with the SEC on July27, 2007 and subsequently mailed to stockholders on or about July28, 2007 (the Proxy Supplement). Class action and derivative plaintiffs subsequently withdrew their motions to enjoin the August8, 2007 special meeting of stockholders.
Subsequently, on August7, 2007, Levy filed an Application for Attorneys Fees, stating that the substantive issues in the case had been resolved and seeking $750,000 in attorneys fees. Levy alleged that its lawsuit caused the Company to issue the Proxy Supplement, which, Levy contended, contained material disclosures critical to the stockholders assessment of the fairness of the Merger. Levy filed a Second Amended Petition and Amended Application for Attorneys Fees on October25, 2007, replacing Levy Investments with Yona Levy as plaintiff. In late December 2007, the parties reached a tentative settlement wherein the Company agreed to pay derivative plaintiffs counsel $290,000 as consideration for their contribution to the issuance of the Proxy Supplement. The settlement includes a mutual release between the Company and Yona Levy, in his individual capacity and in his derivative capacity as a stockholder of the Company. An order approving the settlement and a judgment dismissing the derivative claims were entered on January31, 2008.
On August14, 2007, class plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Petition, in which they withdrew all prior claims but added a claim for an equitable award of attorneys fees. Similar to Levy, class plaintiffs allege that their lawsuits caused the Company to issue the Proxy Supplement, and that the supplement constituted a benefit to the Company, its directors and stockholders for which class plaintiffs attorneys should be compensated. In mid-December 2007, the parties reached a tentative settlement wherein the Company agreed to pay class F-40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) plaintiffs counsel $380,000 as consideration for their contribution to the issuance of the Proxy Supplement. The parties are in the process of finalizing a stipulation of settlement, which must be approved by the Court.
The Company continues to contend that the disclosures in the Definitive Proxy were appropriate and adequate, and that we made the Proxy Supplement available to stockholders solely to lessen the risk of any delay of the closing of the Merger as a result of the litigation. The Company denies that the Proxy Supplement contained any material disclosures or constituted any benefit to the Company, its directors or its stockholders.
On January30, 2008, the Company filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Aladdin Solutions, Inc. (f/k/a Aladdin Holdco, Inc.) and Aladdin Merger Sub, Inc. seeking specific performance of their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement, including covenants to use reasonable best efforts to obtain required regulatory approvals and to consummate the Merger. This lawsuit was filed in response to a written notice we received on January25, 2008 from Aladdin Solutions, Inc. informing us that it did not anticipate the condition to closing the Merger relating to obtaining approvals from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would be satisfied. On February8, 2008, the Company filed a notice to dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice in response to confirmation of the defendants commitment to work to consummate the Merger.
In addition, from time to the Company is involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of its business that the Company believes will not have a material adverse affect on our business or financial condition, including claims and lawsuits alleging breaches of our contractual obligations.
19. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit through charge cards. Such instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. The contract or notional amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of the Companys involvement in particular classes of financial instruments.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The estimated fair values of the Companys financial instruments were as follows: December31, 2007 2006 Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value (In thousands) Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 265,839 $ 265,839 $ 180,075 $ 180,075 Due from card associations 21,456 21,456 108,671 108,671 Trade receivables, net 306,992 306,992 271,563 271,563 Sellers interest and credit card receivables, net 652,434 652,434 569,389 569,389 Redemption settlement assets, restricted 317,053 317,053 260,957 260,957 Due from securitizations 379,268 379,268 325,457 325,457 Financial liabilities Accounts payable 134,790 134,790 112,582 112,582 Merchant settlement obligations 216,560 216,560 188,336 188,336 Debt 1,330,505 1,323,218 1,044,377 1,048,477 F-41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair values of financial instruments as disclosed herein: Cash and cash equivalents, due from card associations, trade receivables, net, accounts payable, and merchant settlement obligations The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short maturity.
Sellers interest and credit card receivables, net The carrying amount of credit card receivables approximates fair value due to the short maturity, and the average interest rates approximate current market origination rates.
Redemption settlement assets Fair values for securities are based on quoted market prices.
Due from securitizations The spread deposits and I/O strips are recorded at their fair value. The carrying amount of excess funding deposits approximates its fair value due to the relatively short maturity period and average interest rates, which approximate current market rates.
Debt The fair value was estimated based on the current rates available to the Company for debt with similar remaining maturities.

SEGMENT INFORMATION Operating segments are defined by SFAS No.131 Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Companys chief operating decision making group is the Executive Committee of management, which consists of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and all Executive Vice Presidents. The operating segments are reviewed separately because each operating segment represents a strategic business unit that generally offers different products and serves different markets.
The Company operates in three reportable segments: Marketing Services, Credit Services and Transaction Services.
Marketing Services provides loyalty programs, such as the AIR MILES Reward Program, and integrated direct marketing solutions that combine database marketing technology and analytics with a broad range of direct marketing services, that includes email marketing campaigns. The Marketing Services segment has two operating segments, AIR MILES Reward Program and U.S. Marketing Services that have been aggregated to one reportable segment.
Credit Services provides private label, commercial and co-branded credit card receivables financing. Credit Services generally securitizes the credit card receivables that it underwrites from its private label retail card programs.
Transaction Services encompasses card processing, billing and payment processing and customer care for specialty and petroleum retailers (processing services), customer information system hosting, customer care and billing and payment processing for regulated and de-regulated municipal utilities (utility services) and point-of-sale services (merchant services).
The Transaction Services segment performs card processing and servicing activities for cardholder accounts generated by the Credit Services segment. For this, the Transaction Services segment receives a fee equal to its direct costs before corporate overhead plus a margin. The margin is based on estimated current market rates for similar services. This fee represents an operating cost to the Credit Services segment and a corresponding revenue for the Transaction Services segment. Inter-segment sales are eliminated upon consolidation. Revenues earned by the Transaction Services segment from servicing the Credit Services segment, and consequently paid by the Credit Services segment to the Transaction Services segment, are set forth opposite Other and eliminations in the tables below.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are generally the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Corporate overhead is allocated equally across the segments.
Interest expense, net and income taxes are not allocated to the segments in the computation of segment operating profit for internal evaluation purposes. Total assets are not allocated to the segments.

(2) Merger and other costs are not allocated to the segments in the computation of segment operating profit for internal evaluation purposes. Merger costs represent investment banking, legal, and accounting costs. Other costs represent compensation charges related to certain departing corporate executives.
