PART I Item 1. Business Our Company We are a leading provider of transaction services, credit services and marketing services in North America. We focus on facilitating and managing electronic transactions between our clients and their customers through multiple distribution channels including in-store, catalog and the Internet. Our credit and marketing services assist our clients in identifying and acquiring new customers, as well as helping to increase the loyalty and profitability of their existing customers. We have a client base in excess of 300 companies, consisting mostly of specialty retailers, petroleum retailers, utilities, supermarkets and financial services companies. We generally have long-term relationships with our clients, with contracts typically ranging from three to five years in duration.
We are the result of the 1996 merger of two entities acquired by Welsh Carson Anderson& Stowe: J.C. Penney's transaction services business, BSI Business Services,Inc., and Limited Brands,Inc.'s credit card bank operation, World Financial Network National Bank. In June2001, we concluded the initial public offering of our common stock, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. During 2003, we completed two secondary public offerings whereby Limited Commerce Corp., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Limited Brands and which was our second largest stockholder, sold all of our shares of common stock it beneficially owned. We continue to execute on our growth strategy through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions.
In early 2003, we entered into contracts to provide private label credit card services to American Home Furnishings, Eddie Bauer, Spiegel Catalog and Newport News and we extended our contract with Brylane through 2013. In addition, we extended our client relationships through August2009 with Lerner New York and Limited Brands and its retail affiliates, including Limited Stores, Victoria's Secret, Express, Express Men's, Bath& Body Works and Henri Bendel. In August2003, we entered into multi-year agreements with Limited Too. Under these agreements with Limited Too, we will continue to provide private label credit card services through 2010 and will also, under a separate multi-year agreement, now provide bankcard authorization services for Limited Too's 537 stores throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. In September2003, we completed the acquisition and 3 conversion of Stage Stores' portfolio of approximately 800,000 active private label credit card accounts and assumed overall operation of Stage Stores' private label credit card program. In October2003, we were selected by Fortunoff to provide private label services and assume Fortunoff's existing portfolio. In November2003, Shop at Home Network announced that it would start a new private label program with us.
Since the beginning of 2003, Marketing Services has signed renewals with Shell Canada and the MasterCard division of BMO Bank of Montreal, each a significant sponsor of our AIR MILES Reward Program, and added pharmacy chain Jean Coutu in the province of Quebec. In December2003, we entered into a new long-term agreement with Air Canada, the major supplier of air travel rewards to our AIR MILES Reward Program.
In March2003, we took over the customer care back office operations of American Electric Power related to the Texas marketplace. As part of the transaction, we acquired a contract to provide billing and customer care services to over 800,000 accounts that had been recently acquired by a U.S. subsidiary of Centrica plc. We also signed a multi-year extension to continue as Marathon Ashland Petroleum's exclusive provider of network processing and bankcard settlement and a five-year contract extension with ConocoPhillips to continue providing network authorization and capture services for its 12,000 Conoco and Phillips 66 branded locations nationwide and to provide similar services for 5,000 ConocoPhillips 76 branded locations.
In September2003, we acquired Conservation Billing Services, a Florida-based submetering service provider. Through this acquisition, we now provide submetering services that include automated meter reading, billing and collecting for clients that manage commercial properties that house multiple tenants, such as malls and multi-family properties. During September2003, we also entered into a seven-year agreement with the Orlando Utilities Commission, a large municipal utility. Under this agreement we provide an outsourced customer information system solution and other related billing processes to service the Orlando Utilities Commission's approximately 200,000 regulated residential and commercial electricity accounts in Florida. In December2003, we acquired Orcom Solutions,Inc., a leading provider of customer care and billing services to electric, gas, water and waste water utilities in North America, primarily in the mid-tier utility marketplace.
Our corporate headquarters are located at 17655 Waterview Parkway, Dallas, Texas 75252, and our telephone number is 972-348-5100.
Our Market Opportunity and Growth Strategy Our services are applicable to the full spectrum of commerce opportunities involving companies that sell products and services to individual consumers. We are well positioned to benefit from trends favoring outsourcing and electronic transactions. Many companies, including retailers, petroleum companies and utilities, lack the economies of scale and core competencies necessary to support their own transaction processing infrastructure and credit card and database operations. Companies are also increasingly outsourcing the development and management of their marketing programs. Additionally, the use of card-based forms of payment by consumers in the United States has steadily increased over the past ten years. According to The Nilson Report, consumer expenditures in the United States using card-based systems are expected to grow from 32% of all payments in 2001 to 46% in 2010.
Our growth strategy is to pursue initiatives to capitalize on our market position and core competencies. Key elements of our strategy are:  Expanding relationships with our base of over 300 clients by offering them integrated transaction processing and marketing services.
We offer our clients products and services that will help them more effectively understand and service their customers and allow them to build and maintain 4 long-term relationships with their customers. By providing services directly to our clients' customers we are able to become an integral part of our clients' business.
Expanding our client base in our existing market sectors.
We will continue focusing on particular markets that are experiencing rapid growth and increasingly utilizing outsourcing, such as transaction and credit services related to our private label programs for retailers, marketing services related to the AIR MILES Reward Program in Canada and transaction services for the utility industry.
Continuing to establish long-term relationships with our clients that result in a stable and recurring revenue base.
We seek to maintain a stable and recurring revenue base by building and maintaining long-term relationships with our clients and entering into contracts that typically extend for three to five years. Most of our services require the payment of monthly fees based on the number of transactions we process, allowing us to generate recurring revenues.
Pursuing focused, strategic acquisitions and alliances to enhance our core capabilities, increase our scale and expand our range of services.
Since our inception we have grown in part through selective acquisitions. We intend to continue to acquire other companies with complementary products, services or relationships to enhance and expand our offering and increase our market share. We also seek to enter into other strategic relationships that extend our customer reach and generate additional revenue.
Products and Services Our products and services are centered around three core capabilitiesTransaction Services, Credit Services and Marketing Services. We have traditionally marketed and sold our products and services on a stand-alone basis but increasingly market and sell them on a bundled and integrated basis. Our products and services and target markets are listed below. Financial information about our segments and geographic areas appears in Note18 of our consolidated financial statements.
Segment Products and Services Target Markets Transaction Services Issuer Services Specialty Retail - Card Processing - Billing and Payment Processing - Customer Care Utility Services - Customer Information System Hosting - Customer Care - Billing and Payment Processing Utility Merchant Services - Point-of-Sale Services - Merchant Bankcard Services Petroleum Retail Credit Services Private Label Receivables Financing - Underwriting and Risk Management - Merchant Processing - Receivables Funding Specialty Retail Petroleum Retail Marketing Services Loyalty Programs - AIR MILES Reward Program - One-to-One Loyalty Marketing Services Financial Services Supermarkets Petroleum Retail Specialty Retail Utility 5 Transaction Services We facilitate and manage transactions between our clients and their customers through our scalable processing systems. Our largest clients within this segment include Limited Brands and its retail affiliates, representing approximately 17.4% of this segment's 2003 revenue.
Issuer Services.
According to The Nilson Report, based on the total number of accounts on file, we were the second largest outsourcer of retail private label card programs in the United States in 2002, with over 72.0million accounts on file. We assist clients in issuing private label credit cards with the retailers' brand that can be used by customers at the clients' store locations, catalog or Internet. We also provide service and maintenance to our clients' private label card programs and assist our clients in acquiring, retaining and managing valuable repeat customers. Our Transaction Services segment performs issuer services for our Credit Services segment in connection with that segment's private label card programs. The inter-segment services accounted for 47.4% of Transaction Services revenue in 2003.
We have developed a proprietary private label credit card system designed specifically for retailers with the flexibility to make changes to accommodate our clients' specific needs. We have also built into the system marketing tools to assist our clients in increasing sales. We utilize our Quick Credit and On-Line Prescreen products to originate new private label credit card accounts. We believe that these products provide an effective marketing advantage over competing services.
We use automated technology for bill preparation, printing and mailing. Commingling statements, presorting and bar coding allow us to take advantage of postal discounts. In addition, we also process customer payments using image processing technology to maximize efficiency. By doing so, we improve the funds availability for both our clients and for those private label receivables that we own or securitize.
Our customer care operations are influenced by our retail heritage. We focus our training programs in all areas on achieving the highest possible standards. We monitor our performance by conducting surveys with our clients and their customers. Our call centers are equipped to handle phone, mail, fax and Internet inquiries. We also provide collection activities on delinquent accounts to support our retail private label credit card programs.
Utility Services.
We believe that we are one of the largest independent service providers of customer information systems for utilities in North America. We provide a comprehensive single source business solution for customer care and billing solutions. We have solutions for both the regulated and de-regulated marketplace. These solutions provide not only hosting of the customer information system, but also customer care and statement generation, focusing on successful acquisition, value enhancement and retention of our clients' customers.
In both a regulated and de-regulated environment, providers will need more sophisticated and complex billing and customer information systems to effectively compete in the marketplace. We believe that our ability to integrate transaction and marketing services effectively will provide a competitive advantage for us.
Our current service offering is based on hosting customer information systems that allow us to provide our core service offerings of call center operation, statement generation and payment processing. In addition, we offer customer acquisition and database marketing services.
Merchant Services.
We are a leading provider of transaction processing services, based on transactions processed, with an emphasis on the U.S. petroleum retail industry. Additionally, we have a significant presence in the specialty retail and transportation industries. We have built a network that enables us to process virtually all electronic payment types including credit card, debit card, prepaid card, electronic benefits and fleet and check transactions. In addition to authorization and settlement of 6 transactions, we also provide merchants with on-line, two-way mail messaging between our clients and their individual locations by broadcasting and receiving messages through their terminal devices.
Credit Services Through our Credit Services segment we are able to finance and operate private label programs more effectively than a typical retailer can operate a stand alone program, as we are able to fund receivables through our securitization program to achieve lower borrowing costs while having the infrastructure to support and leverage a variety of portfolio types and a large number of account holders. Through our subsidiary, World Financial Network National Bank, we underwrite the accounts and fund purchases for over 60 private label credit clients, representing almost 82.7million cardholders and over $3.1billion of receivables as of December31, 2003. Our clients are predominately specialty retailers, and the largest within this segment include Limited Brands and its retail affiliates, representing 36.8% of this segment's 2003 revenue, and Brylane, representing 17.6% of this segment's 2003 revenue.
We believe that an effective risk management process is important in both account underwriting and servicing. We use a risk analysis in establishing initial credit limits with cardholders. Because we process a large number of credit applications each year, we use automated proprietary scoring technology and verification procedures to process these applications. Our underwriting process involves the purchase of credit bureau information for each credit applicant. We continuously validate, monitor and maintain the scorecards, and we use the resulting data to ensure optimal risk performance. These models help segment prospects into narrower ranges within each risk score provided by credit bureau services, allowing us to better evaluate individual credit risk and to tailor our risk-based pricing accordingly. We generally receive a merchant fee for processing sales transactions charged to a private label credit card program for which we provide receivables funding. Processing includes authorization and settlement of the funds to the retailer, net of our merchant discount fee.
We utilize a securitization program as our primary funding vehicle for private label credit card receivables. Securitizations involve the packaging and selling of both current and future receivable balances of credit card accounts to a special purpose entity that then sells them to a master trust. Our Transaction Services segment retains rights to service the securitized accounts. Our securitizations are treated as sales for accounting purposes and, accordingly, the receivable is removed from our balance sheet. We retain an ownership interest in the receivables, which is commonly referred to as a seller's interest, and a residual interest in the trust, which is commonly referred to as an interest only strip. The fair value of the interest only strip is based on assumptions regarding future payments and credit losses and is subject to volatility that could materially affect our operating results. Both the amount and timing of estimated cash flows are dependent on the performance of the underlying credit card receivables, and actual cash flows may vary significantly from expectations. If payments from cardholders or defaults by cardholders exceed our estimates, we may be required to decrease the carrying value of the interest only strips through a charge against earnings. Limited Brands and its retail affiliates accounted for approximately 29.0% of the receivables in the trust portfolio as of December31, 2003, and Brylane accounted for approximately 13.8%.
In November2002, World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust, World Financial Network Credit Card Master Note Trust, World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust II and World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust III, which we refer to as the WFN Trusts, completed a $600.0million offering of five-year asset backed notes issued as part of our securitization program for World Financial Network National Bank. The notes were issued through the World Financial Network Credit Card Master Note Trust. In June and August2003, the WFN Trusts completed another $600million offering of five-year asset backed notes, issued in multiple offerings under our securitization program. The notes are rated AAA through BBB, or its equivalent, by each of Standard& Poor's, Moody's Investor Services and Fitch debt-rating services and are secured by a 7 beneficial interest in a pool of receivables that arise under World Financial Network National Bank's private label credit card accounts.
Marketing Services Our clients are focused on targeting, acquiring and retaining loyal and profitable customers. We create and manage marketing programs that result in securing more frequent and sustained customer purchasing. We utilize the information gathered through our loyalty programs to help our clients design and implement effective marketing programs. Our primary service for this segment is the AIR MILES Reward Program, representing the substantial majority of this segment's 2003 revenue. Our clients within this segment are financial services providers, supermarkets, petroleum retailers and specialty retailers. BMO Bank of Montreal, Canada Safeway, Shell Canada and Amex Bank of Canada were the four largest Marketing Services clients in 2003, and represented approximately 61.0% of our 2003 Marketing Services revenue. BMO Bank of Montreal represented approximately 32.3% of this segment's 2003 revenue and Canada Safeway represented approximately 11.7% of this segment's 2003 revenue.
AIR MILES Reward Program.
We operate what we believe to be the largest loyalty program in Canada. The AIR MILES Reward Program enables consumers to earn AIR MILES reward miles as they shop across a range of retailers and other sponsors participating in the AIR MILES Reward Program. The AIR MILES Reward Program has enabled sponsors to use this tool to increase revenues by bringing new customers to the sponsor, retaining existing customers and increasing the amount spent by customers.
We deal with three primary parties in connection with our AIR MILES Reward Program: Sponsors, Collectors and Suppliers.
Sponsors A sponsor enters into an agreement with us to secure exclusive rights for its particular region and product or service category, to reward customers for changing their shopping behavior and to increase sales from collectors. The program has over 100 brand names represented by sponsors, including BMO Bank of Montreal, Canada Safeway, Amex Bank of Canada, Shell Canada, A&P Canada and Sobeys.
Collectors Members of the AIR MILES Reward Program, known as collectors, accumulate AIR MILES reward miles based on their purchasing behavior at sponsor locations. The AIR MILES Reward Program offers a reward structure that provides a quick and easy way for collectors to earn a broad selection of travel, entertainment and other lifestyle rewards by shopping at participating sponsors. Our active participants represent over 69% of all Canadian households. We have issued over fifteen billion AIR MILES reward miles since the program's inception in 1992.
Suppliers We enter into supply agreements with suppliers of rewards to the program such as airlines, movie theaters and manufacturers of consumer electronics. We make these reward opportunities available through over 180 reward suppliers.
Marketing Services.
In the U.S. we have developed marketing capabilities designed to increase loyal, profitable customers for our clients. Our suite of analytical and profiling tools enable our clients to better understand their customers and optimize opportunities for developing loyal and profitable customer relationships.
8 Safeguards to Our Business; Disaster and Contingency Planning We have a number of safeguards to protect us from the risks we face as a business. Given the significant amount of data that we manage, much of which is real-time data to support our clients' commerce initiatives, we have established redundant facilities for our data centers. We operate two data processing centers. In the event of a disaster at either of our two data centers, we can restore that data center's systems at a third party provided disaster recovery center.
Protection of Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights We rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other similar measures to protect our proprietary information and technology used in each segment of our business. We currently hold one patent. In addition, we have three patent applications with the U.S Patent and Trademark Office and one international application that has entered the national phase in two countries. We generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate partners, and generally control access to and distribution of our technology, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite the efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain the use of our products or technology that we consider proprietary and third parties may attempt to develop similar technology independently. We pursue registration and protection of our trademarks primarily in the United States and Canada, although we do have applications pending in South American and European countries. Effective protection of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in some countries. The laws of some countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the United States and Canada. We are the exclusive Canadian licensee of the AIR MILES family of trademarks pursuant to a license agreement with Air Miles International Trading B.V. We believe that our trademarks are important for our branding and corporate identification and marketing of our services in each segment.
Competition The markets for our products and services are highly competitive. We compete with data processing companies, credit card issuers and marketing services companies, as well as with the in-house staffs of our current and potential clients.
Transaction Services.
We are a leading provider of transaction services. Our focus has been on industry segments characterized by companies with large customer bases, detail-rich data and high transaction volumes. Targeting these specific market sectors allows us to develop and deliver solutions that meet the needs of these sectors. This focus is consistent with our marketing strategy for all products and services. Additionally, we believe we effectively distinguish ourselves from other payment processors by providing solutions that help our clients leverage investments they have made in their payment systems by using these systems for electronic marketing programs. Competition in the area of utility services comes primarily from larger, more well-funded and well-established competitors and from companies developing in-house solutions and capabilities.
Credit Services.
Our credit services business competes primarily with financial institutions whose marketing focus has been on developing credit card programs with large revolving balances. These competitors further drive their businesses by cross selling their other financial products to their cardholders. Our focus has been on targeting retailers that understand the competitive advantage of developing loyal customers. Typically these retailers have customers that make more frequent and smaller transactions. This results in the effective capture of detail-rich data within our database marketing services, allowing us to mine and analyze this data to develop successful customer relationship management strategies for our clients. As an issuer of private label credit cards, we 9 compete with other payment methods, primarily general purpose credit cards like Visa and MasterCard, which we also issue, and American Express, as well as cash, checks and debit cards.
Marketing Services.
As a provider of marketing services, we generally compete with advertising and other promotional and loyalty programs, both traditional and online, for a portion of a client's total marketing budget. In addition, we compete against internally developed products and services created by our existing and potential clients. For each of our marketing services, we expect competition to intensify as more competitors enter our market. In addition, new competitors with our AIR MILES Reward Program may target our sponsors and collectors as well as draw rewards from our rewards suppliers. Our ability to generate significant revenue from clients and loyalty partners will depend on our ability to differentiate ourselves through the products and services we provide and the attractiveness of our loyalty and rewards programs to consumers. The continued attractiveness of our loyalty and rewards programs will depend in large part on our ability to remain affiliated with sponsors that are desirable to consumers and to offer rewards that are both attainable and attractive to consumers. Intensifying competition will make it more difficult for us to do this. For our database marketing services, our ability to continue to capture detailed transaction data on consumers is critical in providing effective customer relationship management strategies for our clients.
Regulation Federal and state laws and regulations extensively regulate the operations of our credit card services bank subsidiary, World Financial Network National Bank, as well as our industrial loan corporation, World Financial Capital Bank. Many of these laws and regulations are intended to maintain the safety and soundness of World Financial Network National Bank and World Financial Capital Bank, and they impose significant restraints on them to which other non-regulated companies are not subject. Because World Financial Network National Bank is deemed a credit card bank and World Financial Capital Bank is an industrial loan corporation within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, we are not subject to regulation as a bank holding company. If we were subject to regulation as a bank holding company, we would be constrained in our operations to a limited number of activities that are closely related to banking or financial services in nature. Nevertheless, as a national bank, World Financial Network National Bank is still subject to overlapping supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and, as an industrial loan corporation, World Financial Capital Bank is still subject to overlapping supervision by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the State of Utah.
World Financial Network National Bank and World Financial Capital Bank must maintain minimum amounts of regulatory capital. If World Financial Network National Bank or World Financial Capital Bank do not meet these capital requirements, their respective regulators have broad discretion to institute a number of corrective actions that could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Order approving World Financial Capital Bank's application for deposit insurance, World Financial Capital Bank must meet specific capital ratios and paid-in capital minimums, must maintain adequate allowances for loan losses, and must operate within its three-year business plan, among other restrictions. If World Financial Capital Bank fails to meet the terms of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporations' Order, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may withdraw insurance coverage from World Financial Capital Bank and the State of Utah may withdraw its approval of World Financial Capital Bank. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulating framework for prompt corrective action, World Financial Network National Bank must meet specific guidelines that involve measures and ratios of its assets, liabilities, regulatory capital, interest rate exposure and certain off-balance sheet items under regulatory accounting standards, among other factors. Under the National Bank Act, if the capital stock of World Financial Network National Bank is impaired by losses or otherwise, we, as the sole shareholder, may 10 be assessed the deficiency. To the extent necessary, if a deficiency in capital still exists, the FDIC may be appointed as a receiver to wind up World Financial Network National Bank's affairs.
Before World Financial Network National Bank can pay dividends to us, it must obtain prior regulatory approval if all dividends declared in any calendar year would exceed its net profits for that year plus its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any transfers to surplus. In addition, World Financial Network National Bank may only pay dividends to the extent that retained net profits, including the portion transferred to surplus, exceed bad debts. Moreover, to pay any dividend, World Financial Network National Bank must maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. Further, if a regulatory authority believes that World Financial Network National Bank is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound banking practice, which, depending on its financial condition, could include the payment of dividends, the authority may require, after notice and hearing, that World Financial Network National Bank cease and desist from the unsafe practice. Before World Financial Capital Bank can pay dividends to us, it must obtain prior written regulatory approval.
As part of a recent acquisition by World Financial Network National Bank, which acquisition required approval by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency required World Financial Network National Bank to enter into an operating agreement with it and a capital adequacy and liquidity maintenance agreement with us. The operating agreement requires World Financial Network National Bank to continue to operate in a manner consistent with its current practices, regulatory guidelines and applicable law, including those related to affiliate transactions, maintenance of capital and corporate governance. World Financial Network National Bank does not expect that the operating agreement will require any changes in World Financial Network National Bank's current operations. The capital adequacy and liquidity maintenance agreement memorializes our current obligations to World Financial Network National Bank.
We are limited under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act in the extent to which we can borrow or otherwise obtain credit from or engage in other "covered transactions" with World Financial Network National Bank or World Financial Capital Bank, which may have the effect of limiting the extent to which World Financial Network National Bank or World Financial Capital Bank can finance or otherwise supply funds to us. "Covered transactions" include loans or extensions of credit, purchases of or investments in securities, purchases of assets, including assets subject to an agreement to repurchase, acceptance of securities as collateral for a loan or extension of credit, or the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit. Although the applicable rules do not serve as an outright bar on engaging in "covered transactions," they do require that we engage in covered transactions with World Financial Network National Bank or World Financial Capital Bank only on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to World Financial Network National Bank or World Financial Capital Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. Furthermore, with certain exceptions, each loan or extension of credit by World Financial Network National Bank or World Financial Capital Bank to us or our other affiliates must be secured by collateral with a market value ranging from 100% to 130% of the amount of the loan or extension of credit, depending on the type of collateral.
We are required to monitor and report unusual or suspicious account activity as well as transactions involving amounts in excess of prescribed limits under the Bank Secrecy Act, IRS rules and other regulations. Due to recent events, Congress, the IRS and the bank regulators have focused their attention on banks' monitoring and reporting of suspicious activities. Additionally, Congress and the bank regulators have proposed, adopted or passed a number of new laws and regulations that may increase reporting obligations of banks.
We are also subject to numerous laws and regulations that are intended to protect consumers, including state law, the Truth in Lending Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act. These laws and regulations mandate various disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in 11 which we may interact with consumers. These and other laws also limit finance charges or other fees or charges earned in our activities. We conduct our operations in a manner that we believe excludes us from regulation as a consumer reporting agency under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. If we were deemed a consumer reporting agency, however, we would be subject to a number of additional complex regulatory requirements and restrictions.
A number of privacy regulations have been implemented in the United States and Canada in recent years. These regulations place many new restrictions on our ability to collect and disseminate customer information.
Under the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, we are required to maintain a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards relating to customer information. We also were required to develop an initial privacy notice and we are required to provide annual privacy notices to customers that describe in general terms our information sharing practices. If we intend to share nonpublic personal information about customers with nonaffiliated third parties, we must provide our customers with a notice and a reasonable period of time for each customer to "opt out" of any such disclosure.
In addition to the federal privacy laws with which we must comply, states also have adopted statutes, regulations or other measures governing the collection and distribution of personal information about customers. In some cases these state measures are preempted by federal law, but if not, we make efforts to monitor and comply with individual state privacy laws in the conduct of our business.
Canada has likewise enacted privacy legislation known as the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. This act requires organizations to obtain a consumer's consent to collect, use or disclose personal information. Under this act, which took effect on January1, 2001, the nature of the required consent depends on the sensitivity of the personal information, and the act permits personal information to be used only for the purposes for which it was collected. Some provinces have made substantially similar privacy legislation applicable within those provinces. We believe we have taken appropriate steps with our AIR MILES Reward Program to comply with the law.
Employees As of December31, 2003, we had approximately 7,600 employees in the United States and Canada. We believe our relations with our employees are good. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees.

12 Risk Factors Risks Related to General Business Operations Our ten largest clients represented 53.2% of our consolidated revenue in 2003, and the loss of any of these clients could cause a significant drop in our revenue.
We depend on a limited number of large clients for a significant portion of our consolidated revenue. Our 10 largest clients represented approximately 53.2% of our consolidated revenue during the year ended December31, 2003, with Limited Brands and its retail affiliates representing approximately 16.3% of our 2003 consolidated revenue. A decrease in revenue from any of our significant clients for any reason, including a decrease in pricing or activity, or a decision to either utilize another service provider or to no longer outsource some or all of the services we provide, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated revenue.
Transaction Services.
Our 10 largest clients in this segment represented approximately 55.2% of our Transaction Services revenue in 2003. Limited Brands and its retail affiliates were the largest Transaction Services client in 2003, representing approximately 17.4% of this segment's 2003 revenue. Our contracts with Limited Brands and its retail affiliates expire in 2009.
Credit Services.
Our two largest clients in this segment represented approximately 54.4% of our Credit Services revenue in 2003. Limited Brands and its retail affiliates represented approximately 36.8%, and Brylane represented approximately 17.6% of our Credit Services revenue in 2003. Our contracts with Limited Brands and its retail affiliates expire in 2009, and our contracts with Brylane expire in 2013.
Marketing Services.
Our 10 largest clients in this segment represented approximately 76.3% of our Marketing Services revenue in 2003. BMO Bank of Montreal, Canada Safeway, Shell Canada and Amex Bank of Canada were the four largest Marketing Services clients in 2003, representing approximately 61.0% of our 2003 Marketing Services revenue. BMO Bank of Montreal represented approximately 32.3% of this segment's 2003 revenue and Canada Safeway, our second largest Marketing Services client, represented approximately 11.7% of this segment's 2003 revenue. Our contract with BMO Bank of Montreal expires in March2008 and our contract with Canada Safeway expires in December 2005.
Competition in our industry is intense and we expect it to intensify.
The markets for our products and services are highly competitive, and we expect competition to intensify in each of those markets. Many of our current competitors have longer operating histories, stronger brand names and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current and potential competitors.
The markets for the services that we offer may fail to expand or may contract and this could negatively impact our growth and profitability.
Our growth and continued profitability depend on acceptance of the services that we offer. If demand for transaction, credit or marketing services decreases, the price of our common stock could fall and you could lose value in your investment. Loyalty and database marketing strategies are relatively new to retailers, and we cannot guarantee that merchants will continue to use these types of marketing strategies. Changes in technology may enable merchants and retail companies to directly process transactions in a cost-efficient manner without the use of our services. Additionally, downturns in the economy or the performance of retailers may result in a decrease in the demand for our marketing strategies. Further, if our customers make fewer sales of their products and services, we will have fewer transactions to process, resulting in lower revenue. Any decrease in the demand for our 13 services for the reasons discussed above or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our growth and revenue.
We cannot assure you that we will effectively integrate acquisitions or realize their full benefits, and future acquisitions may result in dilutive equity issuances or increases in debt.
We expect to continue to seek selective acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy. If we are unable to successfully integrate completed or any future acquisitions, we may incur substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems, any of which could harm our business and impact the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the failure to successfully integrate any future acquisition may divert management's attention from our core operations or could harm our ability to timely meet the needs of our customers. To finance future acquisitions, we may need to raise funds either by issuing equity securities or incurring debt. If we issue additional equity securities, such sales could reduce the current value of our stock by diluting the ownership interest of our stockholders.
Failure to safeguard our databases and consumer privacy could affect our reputation among our clients and their customers and may expose us to legal claims from consumers.
An important feature of our marketing and credit services is our ability to develop and maintain individual consumer profiles. As part of our AIR MILES Reward Program, database marketing program and private label program, we maintain marketing databases containing information on consumers' account transactions. Although we have extensive security procedures, our databases may be subject to unauthorized access. If we experience a security breach, the integrity of our marketing databases could be affected. Security and privacy concerns may cause consumers to resist providing the personal data necessary to support our profiling capability. The use of our loyalty, database marketing or private label programs could decline if any well-publicized compromise of security occurred. Any public perception that we released consumer information without authorization could subject us to legal claims from consumers and adversely affect our client relationships.
Loss of data center capacity, interruption of telecommunication links, or inability to utilize proprietary software of third party vendors could affect our ability to timely meet the needs of our clients and their customers.
Our ability to protect our data centers against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure and other disasters is critical. In order to provide many of our services, we must be able to store, retrieve, process and manage large databases and periodically expand and upgrade our capabilities. Any damage to our data centers, any failure of our telecommunication links that interrupts our operations or any impairment of our ability to use software licensed to us could adversely affect our ability to meet our clients' needs and their confidence in utilizing us for future services.
As a result of our significant Canadian operations, our reported financial information will be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollars.
A significant portion of our Marketing Services revenue is derived from our Loyalty Group operations in Canada, which transacts business in Canadian dollars. Therefore, our reported financial information from quarter-to-quarter will be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollars over the relevant periods. We do not hedge our entire net investment exposure in our Canadian subsidiary.
Our hedging activity subjects us to off-balance sheet counterparty risks relating to the creditworthiness of the commercial banks with whom we enter into hedging transactions.
In order to execute our hedging strategies, we have entered into interest rate derivative contracts with commercial banks. These banks are otherwise known as counterparties. It is our policy to enter into such contracts with counterparties that are deemed to be creditworthy. However, if macro- or 14 micro-economic events were to negatively impact the respective banks, the banks might not be able to honor their obligations and we might suffer a loss.
Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position, and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third party allegations of infringement may be costly.
Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our trademarks or other intellectual property rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. The actions we take to protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights may not be adequate. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. We cannot assure you that we will be able to prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information. Any infringement or misappropriation could harm any competitive advantage we currently derive or may derive from our proprietary rights. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us. Any claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages. An adverse determination in any litigation of this type could require us to design around a third party's patent or to license alternative technology from another party. In addition, litigation is time-consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of our time and resources. Any claims from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims.
If we are required to pay state taxes on transaction processing, it could negatively impact our profitability.
Transaction processing companies may be subject to state taxation of certain portions of their fees charged to merchants for their services. If we are required to pay such taxes and are unable to pass this tax expense through to our merchant clients, these taxes would negatively impact our profitability.
Risks Particular to Transaction Services The pace of deregulation in the utility sector may not continue as predicted.
The pace of deregulation may not continue as predicted, thereby creating fewer opportunities for certain of the types of services we provide. If the pace of deregulation were to continue to slow, we would continue to increase our focus on regulated activities.
In 2003, our Transaction Services segment derived approximately 47.4% of its revenue from servicing cardholder accounts for the Credit Services segment. If the Credit Services segment suffered a significant client loss, our revenue and profitability attributable to the Transaction Services segment could be materially and adversely affected.
Our Transaction Services segment performs card processing and servicing activities for cardholder accounts generated by our Credit Services segment. During 2003, our Transaction Services segment derived $291.4million, or 47.4% of its revenues, from these services for our Credit Services segment. The financial performance of our Transaction Services segment, therefore, is linked to the activities of our Credit Services segment. If the Credit Services segment were to lose a significant client, our revenue and profitability attributable to the Transaction Services segment could be materially and adversely affected.
Risks Particular to Credit Services If we are unable to securitize our credit card receivables due to changes in the market, the unavailability of credit enhancements, an early amortization event or for other reasons, we would not be able to fund new credit card receivables, which would have a negative impact on our operations and earnings.
Since January1996, we have sold substantially all of the credit card receivables originated by our private label credit card bank, World Financial Network National Bank, to WFN Credit Company, LLC 15 and WFN Funding Company II, LLC, which in turn sold them to the WFN Trusts, as part of our securitization program. This securitization program is the primary vehicle through which World Financial Network National Bank finances our private label credit card receivables. If World Financial Network National Bank were not able to regularly securitize the receivables it originates, our ability to grow or even maintain our credit services business would be materially impaired. World Financial Network National Bank's ability to effect securitization transactions is impacted by the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:  conditions in the securities markets in general and the asset backed securitization market in particular;  conformity in the quality of credit card receivables to rating agency requirements and changes in those requirements; and  our ability to fund required overcollateralizations or credit enhancements, which we routinely utilize in order to achieve better credit ratings to lower our borrowing costs.
Once World Financial Network National Bank securitizes receivables, the agreement governing the transaction contains covenants that address the receivables' performance and the continued solvency of the retailer where the underlying sales were generated. In the event such a covenant or other similar covenant is breached, an early amortization event could be declared, in which case the trustee for the securitization trust would retain World Financial Network National Bank's interest in the related receivables, along with the excess interest income that would normally be paid to World Financial Network National Bank, until such time as the securitization investors are fully repaid. The occurrence of an early amortization event would significantly limit, or even negate, our ability to securitize additional receivables.
Increases in net charge-offs beyond our current estimates could have a negative impact on our operating income and profitability.
The primary risk associated with unsecured consumer lending is the risk of default or bankruptcy of the borrower, resulting in the borrower's balance being charged-off as uncollectible. We rely principally on the customer's creditworthiness for repayment of the loan and therefore have no other recourse for collection. We may not be able to successfully identify and evaluate the creditworthiness of cardholders to minimize delinquencies and losses. An increase in defaults or net charge-offs beyond historical levels will reduce the net spread available to us from the securitization master trust and could result in a reduction in finance charge income or a write-down of the interest only strip. General economic factors, such as the rate of inflation, unemployment levels and interest rates, may result in greater delinquencies that lead to greater credit losses among consumers. In addition to being affected by general economic conditions and the success of our collection and recovery efforts, our delinquency and net credit card receivable charge-off rates are affected by the credit risk of credit card receivables and the average age of our various credit card account portfolios. The average age of credit card receivables affects the stability of delinquency and loss rates of the portfolio. At December31, 2003, 46.9% of the total number of our securitized accounts with outstanding balances and 41.1% of the amount of our outstanding securitized loans were less than 24months old. For 2003, our securitized net charge-off ratio was 7.1% compared to 7.4% for 2002 and 8.4% for 2001. We cannot assure you that our pricing strategy can offset the negative impact on profitability caused by increases in delinquencies and losses. Any material increases in delinquencies and losses beyond our current estimates could have a material adverse impact on us and the value of our net retained interests in loans that we sell through securitizations.
16 Changes in the amount of payments and defaults by cardholders on credit card balances may cause a decrease in the estimated value of interest only strips.
The estimated fair value of interest only strips depends upon the anticipated cash flows of the related credit card receivables. A significant factor affecting the anticipated cash flows is the rate at which the underlying principal of the securitized credit card receivables is reduced. Other assumptions used in estimating the value of the interest only strips include estimated future credit losses and a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. The rate of cardholder payments or defaults on credit card balances may be affected by a variety of economic factors, including interest rates and the availability of alternative financing, most of which are not within our control. A decrease in interest rates could cause cardholder payments to increase, thereby requiring a write down of the interest only strips. If payments from cardholders or defaults by cardholders exceed our estimates, we may be required to decrease the estimated value of the interest only strips through a charge against earnings.
Interest rate increases could significantly reduce the amount we realize from the spread between the yield on our assets and our cost of funding.
An increase in market interest rates could reduce the amount we realize from the spread between the yield on our assets and our cost of funding. A rise in market interest rates may indirectly impact the payment performance of consumers or the value of, or amount we could realize from the sale of, interest only strips. At December31, 2003, approximately 2.7% of our outstanding debt, including the off-balance sheet debt of our securitization program, was subject to fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 2.0%. An additional 67.5% of our outstanding debt at December31, 2003 was locked at an effective interest rate of 4.5% through interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks with notional amounts totaling $2.3billion. Assuming we do not take any counteractive measures, a 1.0% increase in interest rates would result in an annual decrease to pretax income of approximately $5.9million. The foregoing sensitivity analysis is limited to the potential impact of an interest rate increase of 1.0% on cash flows and fair values, and does not address default or credit risk.
We expect growth in our credit services segment to result from new and acquired private label card programs whose credit card receivable performance could result in increased portfolio losses and negatively impact our net retained interests in loans securitized.
We expect an important source of growth in our private label card operations to come from the acquisition of existing private label programs and initiating private label programs with retailers who do not currently offer a private label card. Although we believe our pricing and models for determining credit risk are designed to evaluate the credit risk of existing programs and the credit risk we are willing to assume for acquired and start-up programs, we cannot assure you that the loss experience on acquired and start-up programs will be consistent with our more established programs. The failure to successfully underwrite these private label programs may result in defaults greater than our expectations and could have a material adverse impact on us and the value of our net retained interests in loans securitized.
Current and proposed regulation and legislation relating to our credit services could limit our business activities, product offerings and fees charged.
Various Federal and state laws and regulations significantly limit the credit services activities in which we are permitted to engage. Such laws and regulations, among other things, limit the fees and other charges that we can impose on consumers, limit or prescribe certain other terms of our products and services, require specified disclosures to consumers, or require that we maintain certain licenses, qualifications and minimum capital levels. In some cases, the precise application of these statutes and regulations is not clear. In addition, numerous legislative and regulatory proposals are advanced each year which, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability or further restrict the manner in which we conduct our activities. The failure to comply with, or adverse changes in, the laws 17 or regulations to which our business is subject, or adverse changes in their interpretation, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to collect our receivables and generate fees on the receivables, thereby adversely affecting our profitability.
If our bank subsidiary fails to meet credit card bank criteria, we may become subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act, which would force us to cease all of our non-banking business activities and thus cause a drastic reduction in our profits and revenue.
Our bank subsidiary, World Financial Network National Bank, is a limited purpose credit card bank. The Bank Insurance Fund, which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, insures the deposits of World Financial Network National Bank. World Financial Network National Bank is not a "bank" as defined under the Bank Holding Company Act because it is in compliance with the following requirements:  it engages only in credit card operations;  it does not accept demand deposits or deposits that the depositor may withdraw by check or similar means for payment to third parties;  it does not accept any savings or time deposits of less than $100,000, except for deposits pledged as collateral for extensions of credit;  it maintains only one office that accepts deposits; and  it does not engage in the business of making commercial loans.
If World Financial Network National Bank failed to meet the credit card bank criteria described above, World Financial Network National Bank would be a "bank" as defined by the Bank Holding Company Act, subjecting us to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act. Being deemed a bank holding company could significantly harm us, as we could be required to either divest any activities deemed to be non-banking activities or cease any activities not permissible for a bank holding company and its affiliates. While the consequences of being subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act would be severe, we believe that the risk of becoming subject to such regulation is minimal as a result of the precautions we have taken in structuring our business.
If our industrial loan corporation fails to meet the terms of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or State of Utah Orders, we may be subject to termination of our industrial loan corporation.
Our industrial loan corporation, World Financial Capital Bank, is authorized to do business by the State of Utah and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. World Financial Capital Bank is subject to capital ratios and paid-in capital minimums and must maintain adequate allowances for loan losses and operate within its three-year business plan. While the consequence of losing the World Financial Capital Bank authority to do business would be significant, we believe that the risk of such loss is minimal as a result of the precautions we have taken and the management team we have in place.
Risks Particular to Marketing Services We may not be able to satisfy our collectors if the seating capacity made available to us by Air Canada is inadequate to meet their demands.
On April1, 2003, Air Canada filed for bankruptcy protection under the Canadian Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act in order to restructure its debt and operations. Air Canada is in the process of reducing its fleet size to match current and anticipated capacity requirements. In connection with Air Canada's bankruptcy proceedings, we entered into a new supply agreement with Air Canada effective December15, 2003. If Air Canada sharply reduces its fleet capacity and route network, we may not be able to satisfy our collectors' demands for airline tickets. Tickets from other airlines, if 18 available, could be more expensive than a comparable ticket under our Air Canada supply agreement, and the routes offered by the other airlines may be inadequate, inconvenient or undesirable to the redeeming collectors. As a result, collector satisfaction with the AIR MILES Reward Program would be adversely affected by a reduced route network in Canada and we may experience higher air travel redemption costs.
If actual redemptions by collectors of AIR MILES reward miles are greater than expected, our profitability could be adversely affected.
A portion of our revenue is based on our estimate of the number of AIR MILES reward miles that will go unused by the collector base. The percentage of unredeemed reward miles is known as "breakage" in the loyalty industry. While our AIR MILES reward miles currently do not expire, we experience breakage when reward miles are not redeemed by collectors for a number of reasons, including:  loss of interest in the program or sponsors;  collectors moving out of the program area; and  death of a collector.
If actual redemptions are greater than our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected due to the cost of the excess redemptions.
We could face increased competition from other loyalty programs, including Aeroplan, Air Canada's proprietary frequent flyer program.
As a result of increased competition in the loyalty market, including from Aeroplan, Air Canada's frequent flyer program, we may experience greater competition in attracting and retaining sponsors in our AIR MILES Reward Program.
The loss of our most active AIR MILES reward miles collectors could negatively impact our growth and profitability.
Our most active AIR MILES reward miles collectors represent a disproportionately large percentage of our AIR MILES Reward Program revenue. We estimate that over half of the AIR MILES Reward Program revenues for 2004 will be derived from our most active AIR MILES reward miles collectors. The loss of a significant portion of these collectors, for any reason, could impact our ability to generate significant revenue from sponsors and loyalty partners. The continued attractiveness of our loyalty and rewards programs will depend in large part on our ability to remain affiliated with sponsors that are desirable to consumers and to offer rewards that are both attainable and attractive.
Airline or travel industry disruptions, such as an airline insolvency, could negatively affect the AIR MILES Reward Program, our revenues and profitability.
Air travel is one of the appeals of the AIR MILES Reward Program to collectors. As a result of airline insolvencies and restructurings, we may experience service disruptions that prevent us from fulfilling collectors' flight redemption requests. As a result of airline or travel industry disruptions, or as might result from political instability, terrorist acts or war, some collectors could determine that air travel is too dangerous or, given new airport regulations, too burdensome. Consequently, collectors might forego redeeming points for air travel and therefore might not participate in the AIR MILES Reward Program to the extent they previously did, which could adversely affect our revenue from the program. A reduction in collector use of the program could impact our ability to attract new sponsors and loyalty partners and to generate revenue from current sponsors and loyalty partners.
On April1, 2003, Air Canada filed for bankruptcy protection, from which it has not yet emerged, under the Canadian Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act. If Air Canada were to cease operations as 19 a result of a failure to emerge from bankruptcy protection, we could experience service disruptions that would adversely affect our ability to fulfill collector flight redemption requests and lead to higher air travel redemption costs.
Legislation relating to consumer privacy may affect our ability to collect data that we use in providing our marketing services, which could negatively affect our ability to satisfy our clients' needs.
The enactment of legislation or industry regulations arising from public concern over consumer privacy issues could have a material adverse impact on our marketing services. Any such legislation or industry regulations could place restrictions upon the collection and use of information that is currently legally available, which could materially increase our cost of collecting some data. Legislation or industry regulation could also prohibit us from collecting or disseminating certain types of data, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our clients' requirements.
The Federal Gramm Leach Bliley Act makes it more difficult to collect and use information that has been legally available and may increase our costs of collecting some data. Regulations under this act give cardholders the ability to "opt out" of having information generated by their credit card purchases shared with other parties or the public. Our ability to gather and utilize this data will be adversely affected if a significant percentage of the consumers whose purchasing behavior we track elect to "opt out," thereby precluding us from using their data. Under the regulations, we generally are required to refrain from sharing data generated by our new cardholders until such cardholders are given the opportunity to "opt out." The Federal Do-Not-Call Implementation Act makes it more difficult to telephonically communicate with customers. Regulations under this act give consumers the ability to "opt out," through a national do-not-call list, a state do-not-call list or an internal do-not-call list which is required by the regulation, of having telephone calls placed to them by telemarketers who do not have an existing business relationship with the consumer. This act could limit our ability to provide services and information to our clients. Failure to comply with the terms of this act could have a negative impact to our reputation and subject us to significant penalties.
The Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act restricts our ability to send commercial electronic mail messages to customers. The act requires that a customer provide consent prior to a commercial electronic mail message being sent to the customer and further restricts the transmission information (header/subject line) and content of the electronic mail message. Under the regulation, we generally are prohibited from issuing electronic mail or obtaining a benefit from an electronic mail message until such time as the customer has affirmatively granted permission for us to do so. Failure to comply with the terms of this act could have a negative impact to our reputation and subject us to significant penalties.
The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act enacted in Canada requires organizations to obtain a consumer's consent to collect, use or disclose personal information. Under this act, which took effect on January1, 2001, the nature of the required consent depends on the sensitivity of the personal information, and the act permits personal information to be used only for the purposes for which it was collected. The Loyalty Group allows its customers to voluntarily "opt out" from receiving either one or both promotional and marketing mail or promotional and marketing electronic mail. Heightened consumer awareness of, and concern about, privacy may result in more customers "opting out" at higher rates than they have historically. This would mean that a reduced number of customers would receive bonus mile offers and therefore would collect fewer AIR MILES reward miles.
20 Risks Related to Our Company The affiliated entities of Welsh Carson currently own a significant amount of our common stock. These stockholders may have interests that conflict with yours and may be able to control the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, including a change in control.
As of February27, 2004, the affiliated entities of Welsh Carson beneficially owned approximately 40.5% of our outstanding common stock. Under a stockholders agreement, the size of our board of directors is set at nine. Welsh Carson has the right to designate up to three of the nominees for election to our board of directors as long as it owns more than 20% of our common stock. As a result of board designation powers, Welsh Carson is able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, changes to our charter documents and significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership makes it unlikely that any other holder or group of holders of common stock will be able to affect the way we are managed or the direction of our business. Welsh Carson may have interests that conflict with our interests or those of other stockholders. Welsh Carson's continued concentrated ownership will make it difficult for another company to acquire us and for you to receive any related takeover premium for your shares unless Welsh Carson approves the acquisition.
Delaware law and our charter documents could prevent a change of control that might be beneficial to you.
Delaware law, as well as provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, could discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire us, even though such proposals may be beneficial to you. These provisions include:  a board of directors classified into three classes of directors with the directors of each class having staggered, three-year terms;  our board's authority to issue shares of preferred stock without further stockholder approval; and  provisions of Delaware law that restrict many business combinations and provide that directors serving on staggered boards of directors, such as ours, may be removed only for cause.
These provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could discourage tender offers or other transactions that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for our common stock.
Future sales of our common stock, or the perception that future sales could occur, may adversely affect our common stock price.
As of February27, 2004, we had an aggregate of 105,405,239shares of our common stock authorized but unissued and not reserved for specific purposes. In general, we may issue all of these shares without any action or approval by our stockholders. We have reserved 16,253,000 shares of our common stock for issuance under our stock option and restricted stock plans, employee stock purchase plan and our 2003 long term incentive plan, of which 8,839,405shares are issuable upon vesting of restricted stock awards and upon exercise of options granted as of February27, 2004, including options to purchase approximately 4,012,503shares exercisable as of February27, 2004 or that will become exercisable within 60days after February27, 2004. We have reserved for issuance 1,500,000 shares of our common stock, all of which remain issuable under our 401(k) and Retirement Savings Plan. In addition, we may pursue acquisitions of competitors and related businesses and may issue shares of our common stock in connection with these acquisitions. Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock, and any sale or issuance of our common stock will dilute the percentage ownership held by our stockholders. Further, sales of a substantial number of shares of 21 common stock by our largest stockholder, Welsh Carson, or the perception that such sales could occur, could also adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.
Item 2. Properties As of December31, 2003, we leased over 30 general office properties throughout the United States and Canada, comprising over 1.7million square feet. These facilities are used to carry out our operational, sales and administrative functions. Our principal facilities are as follows: Location Segment Approximate Square Footage Lease Expiration Date Dallas, Texas Corporate, Transaction Services 230,061 October 31, 2010 Dallas, Texas Corporate 61,750 July 31, 2007 Dallas, Texas Transaction Services 247,618 July 31, 2009 San Antonio, Texas Transaction Services 67,540 October 31, 2007 Columbus, Ohio Credit Services 103,161 January 1, 2008 Westerville, Ohio Credit Services 100,800 May 31, 2006 Toronto, Ontario, Canada Marketing Services 137,411 September 16, 2007 We believe our current and proposed facilities are suitable to our businesses and that we will be able to lease, purchase or newly construct additional facilities as needed.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we are involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our business that we believe will not have a material adverse affect on our business or financial condition, including claims and lawsuits alleging breaches of contractual obligations.

For 1999, 2000, and 2001, total transactions are presented.
25 Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We are a leading provider of transaction services, credit services and marketing services in North America. We focus on facilitating and managing electronic transactions between our clients and their customers. We operate in three business segments: Transaction Services, Credit Services and Marketing Services.
Transaction Services.
Transaction Services is our largest segment. The Transaction Services segment primarily generates revenue based on the number of transactions processed, statements generated and customer calls handled. Statements generated and transactions processed are the two primary drivers of revenue for this segment.
Statements Generated: This driver represents the number of statements generated for our private label and utility clients. The number of statements generated in any given period is a fairly reliable indicator of the number of active accountholders during that period. In addition to receiving payment for each statement generated, we also are paid for other services such as remittance processing, customer care and various marketing services. Payments for statements generated represent approximately three quarters of this segment's revenue.
Transactions Processed: This driver represents the number of electronic payments processed in merchant services, including credit card, debit card, prepaid card, electronic benefits and fleet and check transactions, and represents approximately one quarter of this segment's revenue. We are typically paid by our clients for each transaction processed.
Transaction Services is affected by two main industry trends: increased outsourcing and commoditization in payment processing. Companies are increasingly outsourcing non-core processes such as customer information systems, billing and customer care. We are impacted by this trend with our clients in utility services and issuer services. The provision of payment processing services, or merchant services, is dominated by our larger competitors that compete on pricing. As a result, we have chosen to not invest in expanding our merchant services business.
Credit Services.
The Credit Services segment primarily generates revenue from servicing fees from our securitization trusts, merchant discount fees, and net finance charges. Private label credit sales and average securitized portfolio are the two primary drivers of revenue for this segment.
Private Label Credit Sales: This driver represents the dollar value of private label card sales that occur at our clients' point of sale terminals or through catalogs or web sites. We are paid a percentage of these sales, referred to as merchant discount, from the retailers that utilize our private label program. Private label credit sales typically lead to higher portfolio balances as cardholders finance their purchases through our credit card bank.
Average Securitized Portfolio: This represents the average balance of outstanding receivables from our cardholders that have been securitized. Customers are assessed a finance charge based on their outstanding balance at the end of a billing cycle. There are many factors that drive the outstanding balances such as payment rates, charge-offs, recoveries and delinquencies. Management actively monitors all of these factors. Generally we securitize our receivables, which results in a sale for accounting purposes and effectively removes them from our balance sheet to one of our securitization trusts.
Credit services is affected by industry trends similar to Transaction Services. The growing trend of outsourcing of private label credit card programs leads to increased accounts and balances to finance. Additionally, economic trends can impact this segment. Interest expense is a significant component of operating costs. Over the last two years we have experienced a historically low interest rate environment. We have refinanced our recent bond maturities with instruments that lock in our effective 26 interest rate for five year terms. A low interest rate environment is usually indicative of a slower economic environment, which can negatively impact our net charge-offs, a significant cost of financing receivables. In the last five years, our net charge-offs have increased from 7.2% in 1999 to a peak of 8.4% in 2001 as the economy slowed during that period. Interest rates have continued to decrease since 2001, albeit at a slower pace, while we have been able to lower our net charge-offs to our current 2003 rate of 7.1%. Our expectation for 2004 is that we will experience relatively similar levels of net charge-offs and cost of funds as in 2003.
Marketing Services.
Marketing services is represented primarily by our AIR MILES Reward Program, which we believe to be the largest loyalty program in Canada. We primarily collect fees from our clients based on the number of AIR MILES reward miles issued and in limited circumstances the number of AIR MILES reward miles redeemed. All of the fees collected for AIR MILES reward miles issued are deferred and recognized over time. AIR MILES reward miles issued and AIR MILES reward miles redeemed are the two primary drivers of revenue for this segment, and as a result they are both indicators of the success of the program. These two drivers are also important in the revenue recognition process.
AIR MILES Reward Miles Issued: The number of AIR MILES reward miles issued depends upon the buying activity of the collectors at our participating sponsors. The fees collected from sponsors for the issuance of AIR MILES reward miles represents future revenue and earnings for us.
AIR MILES Reward Miles Redeemed: A majority of the revenue we recognize in this segment is derived from the redemptions of AIR MILES reward miles by collectors. Redemptions also show that collectors are attaining the rewards that are offered through our programs.
Our AIR MILES Reward Program tends not to be significantly impacted by economic swings as the majority of the sponsors are in non-discretionary categories such as grocery, petroleum and financial institutions. Additionally, we target the sponsor's most loyal customers, who are unlikely to change their spending patterns. We are also impacted by changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. The Canadian dollar sharply appreciated this year, which benefited our operating results. Our expectation is that the Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will be more stable in 2004 than in 2003 and remain at its current relative levels.
Year in Review Highlights Our 2003 results of operations were largely impacted by new and renewed agreements with significant clients, several capital market transactions and continued selective execution of our acquisition strategy. During 2003, we signed or renewed agreements with several significant clients:  In January2003, we commenced a multi-year renewal with Brylane, a top ten client.
In March2003, we entered into an agreement to provide utility services to Centrica and American Electric Power in Texas.
In April2003, we signed a renewal and expansion of services provided to ConocoPhillips, a top 15 client.
In April2003, we entered into an agreement with Jean Coutu Group to become a sponsor in our AIR MILES program.
In May2003, we entered into a agreements to start private label credit card programs for Eddie Bauer, Spiegel Catalog and Newport News.
In June2003, we entered into an agreement with American Home Furnishings to convert their existing private label credit card program.
27  In September2003, we entered into an agreement with Orlando Utility Commission to provide customer information solutions and related billing processes to utility customers.
In September2003, we entered into and completed an agreement with Stage Stores to convert their existing private label credit card program.
In October2003, we entered into an agreement with Fortunoff to convert their existing private label credit card program.
In November2003, we entered into an agreement with Shop At Home Network to start a private label credit card program.
In December2003, we signed renewals with Shell Canada and the MasterCard division of BMO Bank of Montreal.
Additionally, in 2003 we completed several significant capital market transactions:  In April2003, we completed a public offering of 10,350,000 shares of our common stock at $19.65 per share. Seven million of the shares were sold by Limited Commerce Corp. and the remaining 3,350,000 shares were sold by us.
In April2003, we used a portion of the net proceeds of the public offering to repay in full $52.0million of outstanding subordinated debt, plus accrued and unpaid interest, held by Welsh Carson.
In April2003, we entered into three new credit facilities to replace our existing facilities.
In June and August2003, we completed the sale of a total of $600.0million in asset backed notes for our securitization trusts.
In November2003, we facilitated a secondary public offering of 8,663,382 shares of our common stock at $26.95 per share on behalf of Limited Commerce Corp. and two affiliated entities of Welsh Carson. We received none of the proceeds from the secondary offering. Following this transaction, Limited Commerce Corp. no longer owns any of our capital stock.
Consistent with our strategy to complete small selective acquisitions, we completed three transactions in the utility services market for a total of approximately $51.7million:  In January2003, we purchased ExoLink Corporation.
In September2003, we purchased Conservation Billing Services,Inc., a provider of sub-metering services.
In December2003, we purchased Orcom Solutions,Inc., a provider of utility services to mid-tier utilities.
Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies that are described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our judgments and estimates in determination of our financial condition and operating results. Estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and, accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates, sometimes materially. Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important 28 to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require management's most subjective judgments. The most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below.
Securitization of credit card receivables.
We utilize a securitization program to finance substantially all of the credit card receivables that we underwrite. Our securitization trusts allow us to sell credit card receivables to the trusts on a daily basis. We use our off-balance sheet securitization program to lower our cost of funds and more efficiently use capital. In a securitization transaction, we sell credit card receivables originated by our Credit Services segment to a trust and retain servicing rights to those receivables, an equity interest in the trust, and an interest in the receivables. The securitization trusts are deemed to be qualifying special purpose entities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and are appropriately not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our interest in the trusts is represented on our consolidated balance sheets as seller's interest (our interest in the receivables) and due from securitizations (our retained interests and credit enhancement components).
In turn, the trusts issue bonds in the capital markets and notes in private transactions. The proceeds from the debt are used to fund the receivables, while cash collected from cardholders is used to finance new receivables and repay borrowings and related borrowing costs. The excess spread is remitted to us as finance charges, net.
Our retained interest, often referred to as an interest only strip, is recorded at fair value. Our interest only strip has historically been valued between 1.75% and 2.25% of average securitized receivables. The fair value of our interest only strip represents the present value of the anticipated cash flows we have retained over the estimated outstanding period of the receivables. This anticipated excess cash flow consists of the excess of finance charges and past-due fees net of the sum of the return paid to bond holders, estimated contractual servicing fees and credit losses. Because there is not a highly liquid market for these assets, we estimated the fair value of the interest only strip primarily based upon discount, payment and default rates, which is the method we assume that another market participant would use to purchase the interest only strip. The estimated market assumptions are applied based upon the underlying loan portfolio grouped by loan types, terms, credit quality, interest rates and geographic location, which are the predominant characteristics that affect payment and default rates.
Changes in the fair value of the interest only strip are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as additional gains related to new receivables originated and securitized or other comprehensive income related to mark to market changes. In recording and accounting for interest only strips, we made assumptions about rates of payments and defaults that we believe reasonably reflect economic and other relevant conditions that affect fair value. Due to subsequent changes in economic and other relevant conditions, the actual rates of payments and defaults generally differ from our initial estimates, and these differences could sometimes be material. If actual payment and default rates are higher than previously assumed, the value of the interest only strip could be impaired and the decline in the fair value recorded in earnings. Further sensitivity information is provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
AIR MILES Reward Program.
Because management has determined that the earnings process is not complete at the time an AIR MILES reward mile is issued, the recognition of revenue on all fees received based on issuance is deferred. We allocate the proceeds from issuances of AIR MILES reward miles into two components based on the relative fair value of the related element:  Redemption element . The redemption element is the larger of the two components. For this component, we recognize revenue at the time an AIR MILES reward mile is redeemed, or, for those AIR MILES reward miles that we estimate will go unredeemed by the collector base, known as "breakage," over the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile. The total amount of deferred revenue related to the redemption element is shown on the balance sheet as "Deferred RevenueRedemption." 29  Service element . For this component, which consists of marketing and administrative services provided to sponsors, we recognize revenue pro rata over the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile. The total amount of deferred revenue related to the service element is shown on the balance sheet as "Deferred RevenueService." Under certain of our contracts, a portion of the proceeds is paid to us at the issuance of AIR MILES reward miles and a portion is paid at the time of redemption. Under such contracts the proceeds received at issuance are initially deferred as service revenue and the revenue and earnings are recognized pro rata over the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile.
The amount of revenue recognized in a period is subject to the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile. Based on our historical analysis, we make a determination as to average life of an AIR MILES reward mile. The estimated life is actively monitored by management and subject to external influences that may cause actual performance to differ from estimates. The estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile is 42months.
We believe that the issuance and redemption of AIR MILES reward miles is influenced by the nature and volume of sponsors, the type of rewards offered, the overall health of the Canadian economy, the nature and extent of AIR MILES promotional activity in the marketplace and the extent of competing loyalty programs. These influences will primarily affect the average life of an AIR MILES reward mile. We do not believe that the estimated life will vary significantly over time, consistent with historical trends. The shortening of the life of an AIR MILES reward mile will accelerate the recognition of revenue and may affect the breakage rate. As of December31, 2003, we had $465.9million in deferred revenue that will be recognized in the future.
Inter-Segment Sales Our Transaction Services segment performs card processing and servicing activities related to our Credit Services segment. For this, our Transaction Services segment receives a fee equal to its direct costs before corporate overhead plus a margin. The margin is based on current market rates for similar services. This fee represents an operating cost to the Credit Services segment and a corresponding revenue for our Transaction Services segment. Inter-segment sales are eliminated upon consolidation. Revenues earned by our Transaction Services segment from servicing our Credit Services segment, and consequently paid by our Credit Services segment to our Transaction Services segment, are set forth opposite "Other and eliminations" in the tables presented in the annual comparisons below.
30 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, fair value loss on interest rate derivative, other expenses, depreciation, amortization and the impact from discontinued operations. Operating EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to EBITDA plus the change in deferred revenue less the change in redemption settlement assets. We have presented EBITDA and operating EBITDA because we use them to monitor compliance with the financial covenants in our credit agreements, such as debt-to-operating EBITDA and operating EBITDA to interest expense ratios. We also use EBITDA and operating EBITDA as an integral part of our internal reporting to measure the performance of our reportable segments and to evaluate the performance of our senior management. Therefore, we believe that EBITDA and operating EBITDA provide useful information to our investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations. EBITDA and operating EBITDA are not intended to be performance measures that should be regarded as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, either operating income or net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In addition, EBITDA and operating EBITDA are not intended to represent funds available for dividends, reinvestment or other discretionary uses, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The EBITDA and operating EBITDA measures presented in this Form10-K may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in our various agreements. The following sets forth a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and operating EBITDA: Year ended December 31, 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 (amounts in thousands) Net income (loss) $ (29,841 ) $ (21,323 ) $ (10,362 ) $ 23,659 $ 67,298 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (6,538 ) 1,841 9,700 18,060 41,684 Interest expense 42,785 38,870 30,097 21,215 17,281 Fair value loss on interest rate derivative   15,131 12,017 2,851 Other expenses(1)  2,477 6,025 834 4,275 Depreciation and other amortization 16,183 26,265 30,698 41,768 53,948 Amortization of purchased intangibles 61,617 49,879 43,506 24,707 20,613 Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes (7,688 )     Loss on disposal of discontinued operation, net of taxes 3,737     EBITDA 80,255 98,009 124,795 142,260 207,950 Plus change in deferred revenue 91,149 40,845 28,717 34,901 112,071 Less change in redemption settlement assets (63,472 ) (18,357 ) 1,677 (15,963 ) (48,978 ) Operating EBITDA $ 107,932 $ 120,497 $ 155,189 $ 161,198 $ 271,043 (1) For the years ended December31, 2000 and 2001, other expenses primarily relate to the write off of equity investments. For the years ended December 2002 and 2003, other expenses are debt related.
31 Results of Operations The accompanying management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gives effect to the restatement of the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December31, 2001 and 2002, and the results of operations for second and third quarters of 2003 as described in Note21 to the consolidated financial statements.
Year ended December31, 2002 compared to the year ended December31, 2003 Year ended December 31, 2002 Revenue EBITDA Depreciation & amortization Operating income (amounts in thousands) Transaction Services $ 538,361 $ 76,772 $ 44,627 $ 32,145 Credit Services 342,132 37,911 6,724 31,187 Marketing Services 231,721 27,577 15,124 12,453 Other and eliminations (245,626 )    Total $ 866,588 $ 142,260 $ 66,475 $ 75,785 Year ended December 31, 2003 Revenue EBITDA Depreciation & amortization Operating income (amounts in thousands) Transaction Services $ 614,540 $ 86,125 $ 51,508 $ 34,617 Credit Services 435,798 77,091 5,581 71,510 Marketing Services 290,180 44,734 17,472 27,262 Other and eliminations (291,374 )    Total $ 1,049,144 $ 207,950 $ 74,561 $ 133,389 Revenue.
Total revenue increased $182.5million, or 21.1%, to $1,049.1million for 2003 from $866.6million for 2002. The increase was due to a 14.2% increase in Transaction Services revenue, a 27.4% increase in Credit Services revenue and a 25.2% increase in Marketing Services revenue as follows:  Transaction Services.
Transaction Services revenue increased $76.2million, or 14.2%, primarily due to increases in the volume of statements generated and in the revenue per statement generated, partially offset by a decrease in total transactions processed. During 2003, utility services statements generated increased 79.7%. The increase in the number of statements generated by utility services was led by our new relationship with Centrica and American Electric Power consummated in the first quarter. The volume of full service private label statements generated increased 8.7%, primarily due to the addition of Spiegel Catalog, Eddie Bauer, Newport News, Stage Stores, and Fortunoff during 2003. In addition, the increase in utility services and full service private label statements led to an increase in revenue per statement of 4.6%. The decrease in total transactions processed was the result of pruning of non-core accounts during the third and fourth quarter of 2002.
Credit Services . Credit Services revenue increased $93.7million, or 27.4%, due to increases in servicing fees and finance charges, net, slightly offset by a decrease in other fees generated from our private label credit card program. Servicing fee income increased by $3.9million, or 8.5%, during 2003 due to an increase in the average outstanding balance of the securitized credit card receivables. Finance charges, net, increased $90.7million, or 44.5%, during 2003 as a result of a 11.5% higher average outstanding securitized portfolio. The increase in average outstanding 32 securitized portfolio is the result of new client signings and growth in our existing programs. The net yield on our retail portfolio for 2003 was approximately 240 basis points higher than in 2002. The increase in the net yield is largely related to an increase in collected yield in addition to lower financing costs as a result of refinancing of our public securitization bonds in June and August2003 and November2002.
Marketing Services.
Marketing Services revenue increased $58.5million, or 25.2%, primarily due to an increase in redemption revenue related to a 20.1% increase in the redemption of AIR MILES reward miles. Additionally, services revenue increased 21.7% as a result of a 9.5% increase in the number of AIR MILES reward miles issued and the corresponding recognition of deferred revenue balances. Changes in the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar accounted for approximately $30.0million of the $58.5million increase in our revenue, or 12.9%. As a result of the increased issuance activity and the increase in the Canadian dollar as of December31, 2003, our deferred revenue balance increased 31.7% to $465.9million at December31, 2003 from $353.8million at December31, 2002. The growth rate in the number of AIR MILES reward miles redeemed continues to outpace the growth rate in the number of AIR MILES reward miles issued, a positive indicator as to the success of the program. The increase in redemptions relates to the continued trend to offer more redemption options to our collectors, such as merchandise and certificates.
Operating Expenses.
Total operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $116.9million, or 16.1%, to $841.2million for 2003 from $724.3million for 2002. Total EBITDA margin increased to 19.8% for 2003 from 16.4% for 2002. The increase in EBITDA margin is due to increases in Marketing Services and Credit Services margins.
Transaction Services . Transaction Services operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $66.8million, or 14.5%, to $528.4million for 2003 from $461.6million for 2002, and EBITDA margin decreased to 14.0% for 2003 from 14.3% for 2002. The decrease in EBITDA margin was primarily driven by start-up costs related to new private label customers and the migration of a call center operation from a third-party vendor. Also contributing to the decrease in EBITDA margin, was a decrease in our merchant services business, primarily resulting from our reduction in the number of total transactions processed. Margin gains and volume growth from private label statements offset the majority of the decrease from merchant services.
Credit Services.
Credit Services operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $54.5million, or 17.9%, to $358.7million for 2003 from $304.2million for 2002, and EBITDA margin increased to 17.7% for 2003 from 11.1% for 2002. The increase in EBITDA margin is the result of lower net charge-offs and financing costs and an increase in private label credit sales and portfolio growth.
Marketing Services . Marketing Services operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $41.3million, or 20.2%, to $245.4million for 2003 from $204.1million for 2002, and EBITDA margin increased to 15.4% for 2003 from 11.9% for 2002. The increase is directly related to the increase in revenue. The increase in the Canadian dollar resulted in a 1.8% increase in EBITDA margin.
Depreciation and Amortization.
Depreciation and amortization increased $8.1million, or 12.2%, to $74.6million for 2003 from $66.5million for 2002. The increase is primarily due to an increase of $12.2million in depreciation and amortization from increased capital expenditures, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of purchased intangibles of $4.1million.
33 Operating Income.
Operating income increased $57.6million, or 76.0%, to $133.4million for 2003 from $75.8million for 2002. Operating income increased primarily from revenue gains, an increase in EBITDA margins and a decrease in purchased intangible amortization.
Interest Expense.
Interest expense decreased $3.9million, or 18.4%, to $17.3million for 2003 from $21.2million for 2002 due in part to the repayment of $52.0million of subordinated debt to Welsh Carson in 2003. Additionally, we had lower average debt outstanding and experienced lower interest rates as a result of our new credit facility.
Fair Value Loss on Derivatives.
During 2003, we incurred a $2.9million fair value loss on an interest rate swap compared to a $12.0million loss in 2002. Part of the fair value loss was associated with cash payments we made to counterparties of $11.1million and $9.4million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In accordance with SFAS No.133, fair value changes in derivative instruments that do not meet the accounting criteria for hedge treatment are recorded as part of earnings. The related derivative is a $200.0million notional amount interest rate swap that swaps a LIBOR based variable interest rate for a fixed interest rate, and expires in May2004.
Taxes.
Income tax expense increased $23.6million to $41.7million in 2003 from $18.1million in 2002 due to an increase in taxable income. The effective rate decreased to 38.3% in 2003 from 43.3% in 2002 due to a benefit from a change in Canadian corporate tax rates.
Transactions with Limited Brands.
Revenue from Limited Brands and its affiliates, which includes merchant and database marketing fees, increased $4.4million to $48.8million for 2003 from $44.4million for 2002. We generate a significant amount of additional revenue from our cardholders who are customers of Limited Brands and its affiliates. Limited Brands is no longer a stockholder, but is still a significant customer.
Year ended December31, 2001 compared to the year ended December31, 2002 Year ended December 31, 2001 Revenue EBITDA Depreciation & amortization Operating income/(loss) (amounts in thousands) Transaction Services $ 503,178 $ 70,067 $ 44,716 $ 25,351 Credit Services 289,420 29,159 3,470 25,689 Marketing Services 198,019 25,569 26,018 (449 ) Other and eliminations (216,898 )    Total $ 773,719 $ 124,795 $ 74,204 $ 50,591 Year ended December 31, 2002 Revenue EBITDA Depreciation & amortization Operating income (amounts in thousands) Transaction Services $ 538,361 $ 76,772 $ 44,627 $ 32,145 Credit Services 342,132 37,911 6,724 31,187 Marketing Services 231,721 27,577 15,124 12,453 Other and eliminations (245,626 )    Total $ 866,588 $ 142,260 $ 66,475 $ 75,785 Revenue.
Total revenue increased $92.9million, or 12.0%, to $866.6million for 2002 from $773.7million for 2001. The increase was due to a 7.0% increase in Transaction Services revenue, an 34 18.2% increase in Credit Services revenue and a 17.0% increase in Marketing Services revenue as follows:  Transaction Services.
Transaction Services revenue increased $35.2million, or 7.0%, primarily due to increases in the generation of statements and in the revenue per statement generated, partially offset by a decrease in transactions processed. The increase in statements generated includes a change in the mix of statements generated. During 2002, utility services statements increased 130.8%, while serviced-only private label statements declined 72.8%. The increase in the number of statements generated by utility services was led by a full year of statements for Georgia Natural Gas and Puget Sound Energy. The decline in serviced-only private label is associated with the deconversion of Charming Shoppes, which led to a decrease in statements generated in the first half of the year. Full service private label statements generated increased 7.5%, primarily due to the addition of Pottery Barn, Restoration Hardware, Crate& Barrel, and Ann Taylor during 2002. In addition, the increase in utility services and full service private label statements led to an increase in revenue per statement of 12.0%. The decrease in transactions processed was the result of pruning of non-core accounts, which led to a decrease in merchant services revenue in the third and fourth quarters of 2002.
Credit Services . Credit Services revenue increased $52.7million, or 18.2%, due to increases in merchant discount fees, servicing fees and finance charges, net. Servicing fee income increased by $5.3million, or 12.9%, during 2002 due to an increase in the average outstanding balance of the securitized credit card receivables. Finance charges, net, increased $35.2million, or 20.9%, during 2002 as a result of a 9.6% higher average outstanding securitized portfolio. The net yield on our retail portfolio for 2002 was approximately 80 basis points higher than in 2001. The increase in the net yield is largely related to lower net charge-offs in 2002, in addition to lower financing costs. The increase in merchant discount fees is related to the 21.6% increase in private label credit sales.
Marketing Services.
Marketing Services revenue increased $33.7million, or 17.0%, primarily due to an increase in redemption revenue related to a 27.9% increase in the redemption of AIR MILES reward miles. Additionally, services revenue increased 10.4% as a result of a 9.0% increase in the number of AIR MILES reward miles issued and the corresponding recognition of deferred revenue balances. As a result of the increased issuance activity, our deferred revenue balance increased 10.9% to $353.8million at December31, 2002 from $318.9million at December31, 2001.
Operating Expenses.
Total operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $75.4million, or 11.6%, to $724.3million for 2002 from $648.9million for 2001. Total EBITDA margin increased to 16.4% for 2002 from 16.1% for 2001. The increase in EBITDA margin is due to increases in Transaction Services and Credit Services margins, partially offset by a decrease in Marketing Services margins.
Transaction Services . Transaction Services operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $28.5million, or 6.6%, to $461.6million for 2002 from $433.1million for 2001, and EBITDA margin increased to 14.3% for 2002 from 13.9% for 2001. The increase in EBITDA margin was primarily driven by the increased statement volumes in utilities services in addition to operational efficiencies in merchant services as a result of our pruning of non-core accounts and reduction of related expenses.
Credit Services.
Credit Services operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $43.9million, or 16.9%, to $304.2million for 2002 from $260.3million for 2001, and EBITDA margin increased to 11.1% for 2002 from 10.1% for 2001. The increase in EBITDA margin is the result of lower net charge-offs and financing costs; excluding these factors, the increase in operating expenses is consistent with the increase in revenues.
35  Marketing Services . Marketing Services operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $31.7million, or 18.4%, to $204.1million for 2002 from $172.4million for 2001, and EBITDA margin decreased to 11.9% for 2002 from 12.9% for 2001. The decrease in EBITDA margin is primarily the result of an increase in marketing expense related to a brand refreshing campaign for the AIR MILES Reward Program in the fourth quarter of 2002.
Depreciation and Amortization.
Depreciation and amortization decreased $7.7million, or 10.4%, to $66.5million for 2002 from $74.2million for 2001. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in amortization of purchased intangibles of $18.8million related to the non-amortization of goodwill in 2002 in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.142. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization from additional capital expenditures.
Operating Income.
Operating income increased $25.2million, or 49.8%, to $75.8million for 2002 from $50.6million for 2001. Operating income increased primarily from revenue gains, an increase of EBITDA margins and a decrease in purchased intangible amortization.
Interest Expense.
Interest expense decreased $8.9million, or 29.6%, to $21.2million for 2002 from $30.1million for 2001 due in part to the repayment of $50.0million of subordinated debt to Welsh Carson and Limited Brands in 2002. Additionally, we had lower average debt outstanding and experienced lower interest rates.
Fair Value Loss on Derivatives.
During 2002, we incurred a $12.0million fair value loss on an interest rate swap compared to a $15.1million loss in 2001. Part of the fair value loss was associated with cash payments we made to counterparties of $9.4million and $5.3million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. In accordance with SFAS No.133, fair value changes in derivative instruments that do not meet the accounting criteria for hedge treatment are recorded as part of earnings. The related derivative is a $200.0million notional amount interest rate swap that swaps a LIBOR based variable interest rate for a fixed interest rate.
Taxes.
Income tax expense increased $8.4million to $18.1million in 2002 from $9.7million in 2001 due to an increase in taxable income.
Transactions with Limited Brands.
Revenue from Limited Brands and its affiliates, which includes merchant and database marketing fees, increased $0.9million to $44.4million for 2002 from $43.5million for 2001. Excluding the effect of the sale of Lane Bryant by Limited Brands in 2001, the increase would have been $4.1million. We generate a significant amount of additional revenue from our cardholders who are customers of Limited Brands and its affiliates. As of December31, 2003, Limited Brands is no longer a stockholder, but is still a significant customer.
Asset Quality Our delinquency and net charge-off rates reflect, among other factors, the credit risk of credit card receivables, the average age of our various credit card account portfolios, the success of our collection and recovery efforts, and general economic conditions. The average age of our credit card portfolio affects the stability of delinquency and loss rates of the portfolio. We continue to focus our resources on refining our credit underwriting standards for new accounts and on collections and post charge-off recovery efforts to minimize net losses. At December31, 2003, 46.9% of securitized accounts with balances and 41.1% of securitized receivables were less than 24months old. As of December31, 2003, our allowance for doubtful accounts related to on-balance sheet private label credit card receivables was $17.2million compared to $5.9million as of December31, 2002. The increase is primarily related to a greater percentage of on-balance sheet receivables as of December31, 2003.
36 Delinquencies.
A credit card account is contractually delinquent if we do not receive the minimum payment by the specified due date on the cardholder's statement. It is our policy to continue to accrue interest and fee income on all credit card accounts, except in limited circumstances, until the account balance and all related interest and other fees are charged off or paid after 90days. When an account becomes delinquent, we print a message on the cardholder's billing statement requesting payment. After an account becomes 30days past due, a proprietary collection scoring algorithm automatically scores the risk of the account rolling to a more delinquent status. The collection system then recommends a collection strategy for the past due account based on the collection score and account balance and dictates the contact schedule and collections priority for the account. If we are unable to make a collection after exhausting all in-house efforts, we engage collection agencies and outside attorneys to continue those efforts.
The following table presents the delinquency trends of our securitized credit card portfolio: December31, 2001 % of Total December31, 2002 % of Total December31, 2003 % of Total (dollars in thousands) Receivables outstanding $ 2,451,006 100 % $ 2,775,138 100 % $ 3,186,799 100 % Receivables balances contractually delinquent: 31 to 60 days $ 59,657 2.4 % $ 53,893 1.9 % 57,931 1.8 % 61 to 90 days 34,370 1.4 33,332 1.2 35,849 1.1 91 or more days 64,175 2.6 64,295 2.3 70,447 2.2 Total $ 158,202 6.4 % $ 151,520 5.5 % $ 164,227 5.2 % Net Charge-Offs.
Net charge-offs comprise the principal amount of losses from cardholders unwilling or unable to pay their account balances, as well as bankrupt and deceased cardholders, less current period recoveries. Net charge-offs exclude accrued finance charges and fees. The following table presents our net charge-offs for the periods indicated on a securitized basis. Average credit card portfolio outstanding represents the average balance of the securitized receivables at the beginning of each month in the year indicated.
Year ended December 31, 2001 2002 2003 (dollars in thousands) Average securitized portfolio $ 2,197,935 $ 2,408,444 $ 2,686,527 Net charge-offs 184,622 177,603 190,399 Net charge-offs as a percentage of average securitized portfolio 8.4 % 7.4 % 7.1 % We believe, consistent with our statistical models and other credit analyses, that our securitized net charge-off ratio will continue to fluctuate.
Age of Portfolio.
The following table sets forth, as of December31, 2003, the number of accounts with balances and the related balances outstanding, based upon the age of the securitized accounts: Age since origination Number of accounts Percentage of accounts Balances outstanding Percentage of balances outstanding (dollars in thousands) 0-11 Months 3,615 31.4 % $ 843,046 26.5 % 12-23 Months 1,783 15.5 466,153 14.6 24-35 Months 1,265 11.0 363,252 11.4 36-47 Months 969 8.4 291,135 9.1 48-59 Months 780 6.8 239,442 7.5 60+ Months 3,104 26.9 983,771 30.9 Total 11,516 100.0 % $ 3,186,799 100.0 % 37 Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities.
We have historically generated cash flows from operations, although that amount may vary based on fluctuations in working capital and the timing of merchant settlement activity. Our operating cash flow is seasonal, with cash utilization peaking at the end of December due to increased activity in our Credit Services segment related to holiday retail sales.
Year ended December 31, 2001 2002 2003 (dollars in thousands) Cash provided by operating activities before change in merchant settlement activity $ 111,169 $ 191,956 $ 98,524 Net change in merchant settlement activity 55,240 (69,387 ) 27,280 Cash provided by operating activities $ 166,409 $ 122,569 $ 125,804 Merchant settlement activity is driven by the number of days of float at the end of the period. For these purposes, "float" means the difference between the number of days we hold cash before remitting the cash to our merchants and the number of days the card associations hold cash before remitting the cash to us. As of December31, 2002 we had one day of float compared to two days of float as of December31, 2003.
We generated cash flow from operating activities before change in merchant settlement activity of $98.5million for the year ended December31, 2003 compared to $192.0million for the comparable period in 2002. The decrease in operating cash flows before change in merchant settlement activity is related to $100.0million in net portfolio acquisition by the credit services segment that has yet to be securitized off balance sheet. Merchant settlement activity fluctuates significantly depending on the day in which the period ends. We utilize our cash flow from operations for ongoing business operations, acquisitions and capital expenditures.
Investing Activities.
We use a significant portion of our cash flows from operations for acquisitions and capital expenditures. We utilized cash flow for investing activities of $256.7million for the year ended December31, 2003 compared to $192.6million for the comparable period in 2002. Significant components of investing activities are as follows:  Acquisitions.
We acquired the following businesses in 2003 for a total of $51.7million, net of cash acquired, compared to acquisitions totaling $35.9million in 2002: Business Month Acquired Segment Consideration ExoLink Corporation January 2003 Transaction Services Cash for Assets Conservation Billing Services, Inc.
September 2003 Transaction Services Cash for Common Stock Orcom Solutions, Inc.
December 2003 Transaction Services Cash for Common Stock  Payments to secure customer processing relationship.
During March2003, we entered into an agreement with Centrica plc and American Electric Power to provide billing and customer care services to over 800,000 accounts in the Texas marketplace. As part of this agreement we paid approximately $30.5million for the contract and back office operations.
Securitizations and Receivables Funding.
We generally fund all private label credit card receivables through a securitization program that provides us with both liquidity and lower borrowing costs. As of December31, 2003, we had over $3.1billion of securitized credit card receivables. Securitizations require credit enhancements in the form of cash, spread accounts and additional receivables. The credit enhancement is funded through the use of certificates of deposit issued through our subsidiary, World Financial Network National Bank. Net securitization activity 38 utilized $118.8million for the year ended December31, 2003 compared to $98.4million in 2002. We intend to utilize our securitization program for the foreseeable future.
Capital Expenditures.
Our capital expenditures for the year ended December31, 2003 were $47.0million compared to $42.4million for the prior year. This is consistent with our normal level of capital expenditures. We have no expectation that this will change in the foreseeable future.
Financing Activities.
Our cash flows provided by financing activities were $165.0million in 2003 compared to $15.7million used in financing activities in 2002. Our financing activities are primarily related to the following events in 2003:  refinancing of our credit facilities in April2003;  receipt of net proceeds of $61.9million from the issuance of equity securities in April2003;  repayment of $52.0million of subordinated debt with a portion of those proceeds; and  exercise of stock options.
Liquidity Sources.
In addition to cash generated by operating activities, we have four main sources of liquidity: our securitization program; certificates of deposit issued by World Financial Network National Bank; our credit facilities; and issuances of equity securities. We believe that internally generated funds and existing sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet current and anticipated financing requirements during the next 12months.
Securitization Program and Off-Balance Sheet Transactions.
Since January1996, we have sold, sometimes through WFN Credit Company, LLC and WFN Funding Company II, LLC, substantially all of the credit card receivables owned by our credit card bank, World Financial Network National Bank, to the WFN Trusts as part of our securitization program. This securitization program is the primary vehicle through which we finance our private label credit card receivables. The following table shows expected maturities for borrowing commitments of the WFN Trusts under our securitization program by year: 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Total (in thousands) Public notes $ 900,000 $  $  $ 600,000 $ 600,000 $ 2,100,000 Private conduits 1,289,595 250,000    1,539,595 Total $ 2,189,595 $ 250,000 $  $ 600,000 $ 600,000 $ 3,639,595 As public notes approach maturity, the notes will enter a controlled accumulation period, which typically lasts three months. During the controlled accumulation period, we will either need to arrange an additional private conduit facility or use our own balance sheet to finance the controlled accumulation until such time as we can issue a new public series in the public markets.
We continue to utilize conduits as a source of funding, including while our public asset backed transactions are being completed. A private conduit facility was put in place to fund the accumulation of the 1996-B notes that matured in June2003. To replace this conduit, the WFN Trusts completed a $600.0million offering of asset backed notes issued in multiple offerings as follows:  In June2003, the WFN Trusts issued $100.0million of ClassA-1 Series2003-A asset backed notes that have an interest rate not to exceed one-month LIBOR plus 0.42% per year and that will mature in May2008 and $40.0million of ClassC-1 Series2003-A asset backed notes that have an interest rate not to exceed one-month LIBOR plus 2.95% per year and that will mature in May2008.
39  In August2003, the WFN Trusts issued $368.0million of ClassA-2 Series2003-A asset backed notes that have an interest rate not to exceed one-month LIBOR plus 0.37% per year and that will mature in May2008, $51.0million of ClassB Series2003-A asset backed notes that have an interest rate not to exceed one-month LIBOR plus 1.10% per year and that will mature in May2008, and $41.0million of ClassC-2 Series2003-A asset backed notes that have an interest rate not to exceed one-month LIBOR plus 2.45% per year and that will mature in June2008.
The notes are rated AAA through BBB, or its equivalent, by each of Moody's Investors Service, Standard& Poor's and Fitch. The WFN Trusts entered into interest rate swaps that effectively fix the interest rates on the notes starting at 5.0% and averaging 4.8% over the term of the interest rate swap.
As of December31, 2003, the WFN Trusts had over $3.1billion of securitized credit card receivables. Securitizations require credit enhancements in the form of cash, spread deposits and additional receivables. The credit enhancement is principally based on the outstanding balances of the series issued by the WFN Trusts and by the performance of the private label credit cards in the securitization trust. During the period from November to January, the WFN Trusts are required to maintain a credit enhancement level of 6% of securitized credit card receivables. Certain of the WFN Trusts are required to maintain a level of between 4% and 6% for the remainder of the year. Accordingly, at December31, 2003 the WFN Trusts typically have their highest balance of credit enhancement assets. We intend to utilize our securitization program for the foreseeable future.
If World Financial Network National Bank were not able to regularly securitize the receivables it originates, our ability to grow or even maintain our credit services business would be materially impaired as we would be severely limited in our financing ability. World Financial Network National Bank's ability to effect securitization transactions is impacted by the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:  conditions in the securities markets in general and the asset backed securitization market in particular; and  conformity in the quality of credit card receivables to rating agency requirements and changes in those requirements; and  our ability to fund required overcollateralizations or credit enhancements, which we routinely utilize in order to achieve better credit ratings to lower our borrowing costs.
We believe that the conditions to securitize private label receivables are favorable for us. We plan to continue using our securitization program as our primary financing vehicle.
Once World Financial Network National Bank securitizes receivables, the agreement governing the transaction contains covenants that address the receivables' performance and the continued solvency of the retailer where the underlying sales were generated. In the event one of those or other similar covenants is breached, an early amortization event could be declared, in which case the trustee for the securitization trust would retain World Financial Network National Bank's interest in the related receivables, along with the excess interest income that would normally be paid to World Financial Network National Bank, until such time as the securitization investors are fully repaid. The occurrence of an early amortization event would significantly limit, or even negate, our ability to securitize additional receivables.
Certificates of Deposit.
We utilize certificates of deposit to finance the operating activities of our credit card bank subsidiary, World Financial Network National Bank, and to fund securitization enhancement requirements. World Financial Network National Bank issues certificates of deposit in denominations of $100,000 in various maturities ranging between three months and two years and with effective annual fixed rates ranging from 1.5% to 4.0%. As of December31, 2003, we had $200.4million of certificates of deposit outstanding. Certificate of deposit borrowings are subject to regulatory capital requirements.
40 Credit Facilities.
On April10, 2003, we entered into three new credit facilities to replace our prior credit facilities. The first facility provides for a $150.0million revolving commitment and matures in April2006. The second facility is a 364day facility and provides for an additional $150.0million revolving commitment that matures in April2004. The third facility provides for a $100.0million revolving commitment to Loyalty Management Group CanadaInc., a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, and matures in April2006. The covenants contained in the three credit facilities are substantially identical. We are in compliance with our covenants.
Advances under the credit facilities are in the form of either base rate loans or eurodollar loans. The interest rate on base rate loans fluctuates based upon the higher of (1)the interest rate announced by the administrative agent as its "prime rate" and (2)the Federal funds rate plus 0.5%, in each case with no additional margin. The interest rate on eurodollar loans fluctuates based upon the rate at which eurodollar deposits in the London interbank market are quoted plus a margin of 1.0% to 1.5% based upon the ratio of total debt under the credit facilities to consolidated Operating EBITDA, as each term is defined in the credit facilities. The credit facilities are secured by pledges of stock of certain of our subsidiaries and pledges of certain intercompany promissory notes.
At December31, 2003, we had borrowings of $179.8million outstanding under these credit facilities (with an average interest rate of 2.7%), we issued no letters of credit, and we had available unused borrowing capacity of approximately $220.2million. The credit facilities limit our aggregate outstanding letters of credit to $50.0million. We can obtain an increase in the total commitment under the credit facilities of up to $50.0million if we are not in default under the credit facilities, one or more lenders agrees to increase its commitment and the administrative agent consents.
We used the initial advances under the new credit facilities to refinance our prior credit facilities. We utilize our credit facilities and excess cash flows from operations to support our acquisition strategy and to fund working capital and capital expenditures.
Issuances of Equity.
On June13, 2001, we completed our initial public offering, which consisted of the sale of 14,950,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $12.00 per share. After deducting expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions, we received net offering proceeds of approximately $160.8million. We used proceeds of approximately $90.8million to repay in full the outstanding balance of a term loan and approximately $500,000 was used to repurchase a then outstanding warrant for 167,084 shares of our common stock. The remaining net proceeds were used to pay down additional debt and support our securitization program, acquisitions and other working capital requirements. In addition, simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering in June2001, we converted all outstanding shares of our SeriesA cumulative convertible preferred stock into approximately 11,199,340 shares of common stock.
In April2003, we completed a public offering of 10,350,000 shares of our common stock at $19.65 per share. Limited Commerce Corp. sold 7,000,000 of those shares and the remaining 3,350,000 shares were sold by us. The net proceeds to us from the offering were $61.9million after deducting offering expenses and our pro-rata underwriting discounts and commissions. Concurrently with the closing of the public offering, we used $52.7million of the net proceeds to repay in full $52.0million of debt outstanding, plus accrued interest, under a 10% subordinated note that we issued in September1998 to an affiliated entity of Welsh Carson.
In November2003, we facilitated a secondary public offering of 8,663,382 shares of common stock at $26.95 per share. 7,533,376 shares were sold by Limited Commerce Corp. and the remaining 1,130,006 shares were sold by Welsh Carson through two of its affiliated entities. We sold no stock and received none of the proceeds from the secondary offering. In connection with the secondary offering, we incurred approximately $450,000 in registration costs, which were expensed in the fourth quarter. As a result of the secondary offering, Limited Commerce Corp. is no longer a stockholder.
41 Contractual Obligations.
The following table highlights, as of December31, 2003, our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments by type and period: Total 2004 2005 & 2006 2007 & 2008 2009 & thereafter (dollars in thousands) Certificates of deposit $ 200,400 $ 195,800 $ 4,600 $  $  Credit facilities 179,789  179,789   Operating leases 116,742 37,061 47,971 22,875 8,835 Capital leases 10,984 5,649 4,440 858 37 Software licenses 107,569 18,863 35,679 34,488 18,539 Purchase obligations(1) 128,224 41,235 56,420 30,152 417 $ 743,708 $ 298,608 $ 328,899 $ 88,373 $ 27,828 (1) Purchase obligations include purchase commitments under our AIR MILES Reward Program, minimum payments under support and maintenance contracts and agreements to purchase other goods and services. The table excludes a contractual obligation of $1.4million contingent on the achievement of certain milestones.
We believe that we will have access to sufficient resources to meet these commitments.
Economic Fluctuations Although we cannot precisely determine the impact of inflation on our operations, we do not believe that we have been significantly affected by inflation. For the most part, we have relied on operating efficiencies from scale and technology, as well as decreases in technology and communication costs, to offset increased costs of employee compensation and other operating expenses.
Portions of our business are seasonal.
Our revenues and earnings are favorably affected by increased transaction volume and credit card balances during the holiday shopping period in the fourth quarter and, to a lesser extent, during the first quarter as credit card balances are paid down. Similarly, our petroleum related businesses are favorably affected by increased volume in the latter part of the second quarter and the first part of the third quarter as consumers make more frequent purchases of gasoline in connection with summer travel.
Regulatory Matters World Financial Network National Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or OCC. World Financial Capital Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by both the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, and the State of Utah. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. Under the FDIC's order approving World Financial Capital Bank's application for deposit insurance, World Financial Capital Bank must meet specific capital ratios and paid-in capital minimums, must maintain adequate allowances for loan losses and must operate within its three-year business plan. If World Financial Capital Bank fails to meet the terms of the FDIC's order, the FDIC may withdraw insurance coverage from World Financial Capital Bank, and the State of Utah may withdraw its approval of World Financial Capital Bank. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, World Financial Network National Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. World Financial Network National 42 Bank is limited in the amounts that it can dividend to us. World Financial Capital Bank is restricted from providing dividends to us at this time.
Quantitative measures established by regulations to ensure capital adequacy require World Financial Network National Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. Under the regulations, a "well capitalized" institution must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6%, a total capital ratio of at least 10% and a leverage ratio of at least 5% and not be subject to a capital directive order. An "adequately capitalized" institution must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4%, a total capital ratio of at least 8% and a leverage ratio of at least 4%, but 3% is allowed in some cases. Under these guidelines, World Financial Network National Bank is considered well capitalized. As of December31, 2003, World Financial Network National Bank's Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.6%, total capital ratio was 19.7% and leverage ratio was 42.0%, and World Financial Network National Bank was not subject to a capital directive order. World Financial Capital Bank, under the terms of the State of Utah's order must maintain Total Capital equal to or exceeding 10% of total assets during the first three years of operations and under the FDIC's order must maintain Tier 1 capital to total assets ratio of not less than 8%.
As part of a recent acquisition by World Financial Network National Bank, which acquisition required approval by the OCC, the OCC required World Financial Network National Bank to enter into an operating agreement with the OCC and a capital adequacy and liquidity maintenance agreement with us. The operating agreement requires World Financial Network National Bank to continue to operate in a manner consistent with its current practices, regulatory guidelines and applicable law, including those related to affiliate transactions, maintenance of capital and corporate governance. World Financial Network National Bank does not expect that the operating agreement will require any changes in World Financial Network National Bank's current operations. The capital adequacy and liquidity maintenance agreement memorializes our current obligations to World Financial Network National Bank.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In April2003, the FASB issued SFAS No.149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." The statement amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under Statement 133. The statement is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after June30, 2003. We have adopted this statement and it did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In May2003, the FASB issued SFAS No.150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." SFAS No.150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within the scope of SFAS No.150 as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). Many of those instruments were previously classified as equity. SFAS No.150 is generally effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June15, 2003. We have adopted this statement and it did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
43 In January 2003 and December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No.46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" FIN No.46 and its revision, FIN No.46R, respectively. FIN No.46R clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No.51, "Consolidated Financial Statements" to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support.
FIN No.46R requires the adoption of either FIN No.46 or FIN No.46R by the first period ending after December15, 2003 for Special Purpose Entities, however, FIN No.46R must be adopted no later than the first period ending after March15, 2004. Non-SPEs are required to be accounted for under the provisions of FIN No.46R no later than the first period ending after March15, 2004. We do not currently believe that any material entities will be consolidated as a result of applying the provisions of FIN No.46R.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. Our primary market risks include off-balance sheet risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and redemption reward risk.
Off-Balance Sheet Risk.
We are subject to off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, including commitments to extend credit and through our securitization program. We sell substantially all of our credit card receivables to World Financial Network Credit Card Master Note Trust, a qualifying special purpose entity. The trust enters into interest rate swaps to reduce the interest rate sensitivity of the securitization transactions. The securitization program involves elements of credit, market, interest rate, legal and operational risks in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet through our retained interests in the securitization and the interest only strips.
Interest Rate Risk.
Interest rate risk affects us directly in our lending and borrowing activities. Our total interest incurred was approximately $124.6million for 2003, which includes both on- and off-balance sheet transactions. Of this total, $17.3million of the interest expense for 2003 was attributable to on-balance sheet indebtedness and the remainder to our securitized credit card receivables, which are financed off-balance sheet. To manage our risk from market interest rates, we actively monitor the interest rates and the interest sensitive components both on- and off-balance sheet to minimize the impact that changes in interest rates have on the fair value of assets, net income and cash flow. To achieve this objective, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates by matching asset and liability repricings and through the use of fixed-rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements. In addition, we enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and treasury locks to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt. We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for trading or other speculative purposes. At December31, 2003, approximately 2.7% of our outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 2.0%. An additional 67.5% of our outstanding debt at December31, 2003 was locked at an effective interest rate of 4.5% through interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks with notional amounts totaling $2.3billion.
The approach we use to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis which we believe best reflects the risk inherent in our business. This approach calculates the impact on pretax income from an instantaneous and sustained increase in interest rates of 1.0%. In 2003, a 1.0% increase in interest rates would have resulted in an annual decrease to pretax income of approximately $5.9million. Conversely, a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase to pretax 44 income. Our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of financial instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions.
Credit Risk.
We are exposed to credit risk relating to the credit card loans we make to our clients' customers. Our credit risk relates to the risk that consumers using the private label credit cards that we issue will not repay their revolving credit card loan balances. We have developed credit risk models designed to identify qualified consumers who fit our risk parameters. To minimize our risk of loan write-offs, we control approval rates of new accounts and related credit limits and follow strict collection practices. We monitor the buying limits as well as set pricing regarding fees and interest rates charged.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk.
We are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. and the Canadian dollar through our significant Canadian operations. We do not hedge our net investment exposure in our Canadian subsidiary.
Redemption Reward Risk.
Through our AIR MILES Reward Program, we are exposed to potentially increasing reward costs associated primarily with travel rewards. To minimize the risk of rising travel reward costs, we:  have supply agreements with airlines in addition to Air Canada;  are seeking new supply agreements with additional airlines;  periodically alter the total mix of rewards available to collectors with the introduction of new merchandise rewards, which are typically lower cost per AIR MILES reward mile than air travel;  allow collectors to obtain certain travel rewards using a combination of reward miles and cash or cash alone in addition to using AIR MILES reward miles alone; and  periodically adjust the number of miles required to redeem a reward.

53 INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Independent Auditors' Report Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December31, 2002 and 2003 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity for the years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements F-1 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT To the Stockholders of Alliance Data Systems Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alliance Data Systems Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December31, 2002 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and the financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Alliance Data Systems Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2002 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2001 the Company changed its method of accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities to conform to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.133, as amended. Additionally, in 2002, the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets to conform to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, No.142.
As discussed in Note21 to the consolidated financial statements, the accompanying 2001 and 2002 consolidated financial statements have been restated.

F-6 ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION Description of the Business Alliance Data Systems Corporation ("ADSC" or, including its wholly owned subsidiaries, the "Company") is a leading provider of transaction services, credit services and marketing services in North America. The Company focuses on facilitating and managing transactions between its clients and their customers through multiple distribution channels including in-store, catalog and the Internet. Through the Credit Services and Marketing Services segments, the Company assists its clients in identifying and acquiring new customers and helps to increase the loyalty and profitability of its clients' existing customers.
The Company operates in three reportable segments: Transaction Services, Credit Services and Marketing Services. Transaction Services encompasses card processing, billing and payment processing and customer care for specialty and petroleum retailers (issuer services), customer information system hosting, customer care and billing and payment processing for regulated and de-regulated utilities (utility services) and point-of-sale services (merchant services). Credit Services provides private label receivables financing. Credit Services generally securitizes the credit card receivables that it underwrites from its private label programs. Marketing Services provides loyalty programs, such as the AIR MILES Reward Program and other marketing services.
2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ADSC and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Due from Card Associations and Merchant Settlement Obligations Due from card associations and merchant settlement obligations result from the Company's merchant services and associated settlement activities. Due from card associations is generated from credit card transactions, such as MasterCard, Visa and American Express, at merchant locations. The Company records corresponding settlement obligations for amounts payable to merchants.
Credit Card Receivables Credit card receivables are generally securitized immediately or shortly after origination. As part of its securitization agreements, the Company is required to retain an interest in the credit card receivables, which is referred to as seller's interest. Seller's interest is carried at fair value and credit card receivables are carried at lower of cost or market less an allowance for doubtful accounts. In its capacity as a servicer of the credit card receivables, the Company receives a servicing fee from the World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust, World Financial Network Credit Card Master Note Trust, World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust II and World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust III ("WFN Trusts"). Management estimates the cost incurred in servicing the credit card receivables approximates the service fees received, and therefore has not recorded a servicing asset or liability as of December31, 2002 and 2003.
Redemption Settlement Assets These securities relate to the redemption fund for the AIR MILES Reward Program and are held in trust for the benefit of funding redemptions by collectors. These securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Debt securities that the Company does not have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as securities available-for-sale.
F-7 Property and Equipment Furniture, fixtures, computer equipment and software, and leasehold improvements are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed on a straight-line basis, using estimated lives ranging from three to 15years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the remaining lives of the respective leases or the remaining useful lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter. Software development (costs to create new platforms for certain of the Company's information systems) and conversion costs (systems, programming and other related costs to allow conversion of new client accounts to the Company's processing systems) are capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position ("SOP") 98-1 "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use" and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the length of the associated contract or benefit period, which generally ranges from three to five years.
Revenue Recognition Transaction and Marketing Services The Company earns transaction fees, which are principally based on the number of transactions processed or statements generated and are recognized as such services are performed. In general, the Company does not enter into license sales for its products or services. In cases where we enter into license sales, revenue is recognized in accordance with SOP 97-2 "Software Revenue Recognition" and related literature.
AIR MILES Reward Program The Company allocates the proceeds received from sponsors for the issuance of AIR MILES reward miles based on relative fair values between the redemption element of the award ultimately provided to the collector (the "Redemption element") and the service element (the "Service element"). The Service element consists of direct marketing and support services provided to sponsors.
The fair value of the Service element is based on the estimated fair value of providing the services on a third-party basis. The revenue related to the Service element of the AIR MILES reward miles is initially deferred and amortized over the period of time beginning with the issuance of the AIR MILES reward miles and ending upon their expected redemption (the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile).
The fair value of the Redemption element of the AIR MILES reward miles issued is determined based on separate pricing offered by the Company as well as other objective evidence. The revenue related to the Redemption element is deferred until the collector redeems the AIR MILES reward miles or over the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile in the case of AIR MILES reward miles that the Company estimates will go unused by the collector base ("breakage"). The Company currently estimates breakage to be one-third of AIR MILES reward miles issued.
Financing charges, net Financing charges, net, represents gains and losses on securitization of credit card receivables and interest income on seller's interest less a provision (credit) for doubtful accounts of $(9.0) million, $6.6million and $20.0million for the years ended December31, 2001, 2002, and 2003, respectively.
The Company records gains or losses on the securitization of credit card receivables on the date of sale based on cash received, the estimated fair value of assets sold and retained, and liabilities incurred in the sale. The anticipated excess cash flow essentially represents an interest only ("I/O") strip, consisting of the excess of finance charges and past-due fees over the sum of the return paid to F-8 certificate holders and credit losses over the estimated outstanding period of the receivables. The amount initially allocated to the I/O strip at the date of a securitization reflects the allocated original basis of the relative fair values of those interests. The amount recorded for the I/O strip is reduced for distributions on the I/O strip, which the Company receives from the related trust, and is adjusted for changes in the fair value of the I/O strip, which are reflected in other comprehensive income. Because there is not a highly liquid market for these assets, management estimates the fair value of the I/O strip primarily based upon discount, payment and default rates, which is the method we assume that another market participant would use to purchase the I/O strip. The estimated market assumptions are applied based upon the underlying loan portfolio grouped by loan types, terms, credit quality, interest rates, and geographic location, which are the predominant characteristics that affect payment and default rates.
In recording and accounting for the I/O strip, management makes assumptions about rates of payments and defaults, which reflect economic and other relevant conditions that affect fair value. Due to subsequent changes in economic and other relevant conditions, the actual rates of payments and defaults would generally differ from our initial estimates, and these differences could sometimes be material. If actual payment and default rates are higher than previously assumed, the value of the I/O strip could be impaired and the decline in the fair value would be recorded in earnings.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Prior to January1, 2002, goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from acquisitions were amortized using the straight-line method over periods up to 25years. In 2002, under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No.142, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are no longer amortized, but are reviewed at least annually for impairment or more frequently if circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred, using the market comparable and discounted cash flow methods. Separable intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over those useful lives.
F-9 Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is based only on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, excluding any dilutive effects of options or other dilutive securities. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive common shares (dilutive stock options and other dilutive securities outstanding during the year). Potentially dilutive common shares were 6.0million for 2001 and none in 2002 and 2003. However, as the Company generated net losses, potentially dilutive common shares, composed of incremental common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants and upon conversion of SeriesA preferred stock, are not included in diluted net loss per share because such shares are anti-dilutive.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2001 2002 2003 (in thousands, except per share amounts) Numerator Net income (loss) $ (10,362 ) $ 23,659 $ 67,298 Preferred stock dividends (3,240 )   Net income (loss) available to common stockholders $ (13,602 ) $ 23,659 $ 67,298 Denominator Weighted average shares 64,555 74,422 78,003 Weighted average effect of dilutive securities: Net effect of dilutive stock options  2,274 2,310 Denominator for diluted calculation 64,555 76,696 80,313 Basic Net income (loss) per share $ (0.21 ) $ 0.32 $ 0.86 Diluted Net income (loss) per share $ (0.21 ) $ 0.31 $ 0.84 Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Currency Translation The assets and liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries outside the U.S., primarily Canada, are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet dates. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Gains and losses resulting from currency transactions are recognized currently in income, and those resulting from translation of financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
F-10 Stock Compensation Expense At December31, 2003, the Company had three stock-based employee compensation plans. The Company accounts for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No.25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees", and related Interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income for stock options, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", to stock-based employee compensation.
Year Ended December 31, 2001 2002 2003 (in thousands, except per share amounts) Net income (loss), as reported $ (10,362 ) $ 23,659 $ 67,298 Add: Stock-based employee compensation expense included in reported net income, net of related tax effects 1,000 1,916 3,725 Deduct: Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all stock option awards, net of related tax effects (10,760 ) (14,642 ) (15,057 ) $ (20,122 ) $ 10,933 55,966 Net income (loss) per share: Basic-as reported $ (0.21 ) $ 0.32 $ 0.86 Basic-pro forma $ (0.31 ) $ 0.15 $ 0.72 Diluted-as reported $ (0.21 ) $ 0.31 $ 0.84 Diluted-pro forma $ (0.31 ) $ 0.14 $ 0.70 The Board of Directors of the Company adopted the 2003 Long Term Incentive Plan on April4, 2003 and the stockholders approved it at the Company's 2003 annual meeting of stockholders on June10, 2003. The plan reserves 6,000,000 shares of common stock for grants of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards and performance shares to officers, employees, non-employee directors and consultants performing services for the Company or its affiliates.
Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are provided for differences arising in the timing of income and expenses for financial reporting and for income tax purposes using the asset/liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statements' carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, using enacted tax rates.
Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets and other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or intangibles may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
F-11 Derivative Instruments The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest and foreign exchange rate changes. Effective January1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, which requires that all derivative instruments be reported on the balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative instrument is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are either recognized in net income or in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in net income. For derivatives that do not qualify as hedges under SFAS No.133, the change in fair value is recorded as part of earnings. It is the policy of the Company to execute such instruments with creditworthy banks and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. See Note16 for more information regarding derivatives.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards In April2003, the FASB issued SFAS No.149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." The statement amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under Statement 133. The statement is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after June30, 2003. The Company has adopted this statement and it did not have a material impact on its financial statements.
In May2003, the FASB issued SFAS No.150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." SFAS No.150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within the scope of SFAS No.150 as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). Many of those instruments were previously classified as equity. SFAS No.150 is generally effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June15, 2003. The Company has adopted this statement and it did not have a material impact on its financial statements.
In January 2003 and December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No.46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" FIN No.46 and its revision, FIN No.46R, respectively. FIN No.46R clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No.51, "Consolidated Financial Statements" to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support.
FIN No.46R requires the adoption of either FIN No.46 or FIN No.46R by the first period ending after December15, 2003 for Special Purpose Entities ("SPEs"), however, FIN No.46R must be adopted no later than the first period ending after March15, 2004. Non-SPEs are required to be accounted for under the provisions of FIN No.46R no later than the first period ending after March15, 2004. The Company does not currently believe that any material entities will be consolidated as a result of applying the provisions of FIN No.46R.
Reclassifications For purposes of comparability, certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.
F-12 3.ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS During the past three years the Company completed the following acquisitions: Business Month Acquired Consideration 2003: ExoLink Corporation.
January 2003 Cash for Assets Conservation Billing Services, Inc.
September 2003 Cash for Common Stock Orcom Solutions, Inc.
December 2003 Cash for Common Stock 2002: Loyalty One, Inc.
January 2002 Cash for Common Stock Enlogix Group September 2002 Cash for Equity Targeted Marketing Services December 2002 Cash for Assets 2001: Utilipro, Inc.
February 2001 Cash for Assets ConneXt, Inc.
August 2001 Cash for Assets MailBox Capital Corp.
September 2001 Cash for Assets All of the above acquisitions are accounted for in the Transaction Services segment. The acquisitions were accounted for as purchases and, accordingly, the operations of the acquired companies were included in the consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition as set forth above. Pro forma information for acquisitions is not presented as the impact was not material.
The terms of certain of the Company's acquisition agreements provide for additional consideration to be paid if the acquired entity's results of operations exceed certain targeted levels, or if certain other conditions are met. Targeted levels are generally set substantially above the historical experience of the acquired entity at the time of acquisition. Such additional consideration is paid in cash.
The following table summarizes the purchase price for the acquisitions, and the allocation thereof: 2001 2002 2003 (in thousands) Identifiable intangible assets $ 15,424 $ 17,752 $ 28,896 Goodwill 63,219 26,196 22,765 Other net assets (liabilities) acquired 10,334 (8,057 ) (5 ) Purchase price $ 88,977 $ 35,891 $ 51,656 The Company does not anticipate any significant adjustments to the purchase price allocations.
During the third quarter of 2003, the Company sold its software development operations in New Zealand to an employee. The operations had previously generated approximately $1.0million in annual revenue. The Company is entitled to receive consideration from the buyer contingent on future operating results measured against predetermined thresholds. Goodwill of $1.9million related to the New Zealand operations has been retained by the Company in its transaction processing segment due to integration of the operations across the segment, as provided for under SFAS No.142. The loss on disposition was not significant. The New Zealand operations are not presented as a discontinued operation due to their insignificance.
F-13 4.REDEMPTION SETTLEMENT ASSETS Redemption settlement assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and securities available-for-sale and are designated for settling redemptions by collectors of the AIR MILES Reward Program in Canada under certain contractual relationships with sponsors of the AIR MILES Reward Program. These assets are primarily denominated in Canadian dollars. Realized gains and losses from the sale of investment securities were not material. The principal components of redemption settlement assets, which are carried at fair value, are as follows: December 31, 2002 December 31, 2003 Unrealized Unrealized Cost Gains Losses Fair value Cost Gains Losses Fair Value (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 17,680 $  $  $ 17,680 $ 21,593 $  $  $ 21,593 Government bonds 9,801 83  9,884 40,383 475  40,858 Corporate bonds 138,364 365  138,729 152,950  (130 ) 152,820 Total $ 165,845 $ 448 $  $ 166,293 $ 214,926 $ 475 $ (130 ) $ 215,271 5.PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment consist of the following: December 31, 2002 2003 (in thousands) Software development and conversion costs $ 107,824 $ 123,114 Computer equipment and purchased software 49,023 71,395 Furniture and fixtures 53,658 60,610 Leasehold improvements 43,822 48,592 Capital leases  8,034 Construction in progress 4,113 5,342 Total 258,440 317,087 Accumulated depreciation (138,802 ) (183,341 ) Property and equipment, net $ 119,638 $ 133,746 6.SECURITIZATION OF CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES The Company regularly securitizes its credit card receivables to the WFN Trusts. During the initial phase of a securitization reinvestment period, the Company generally retains principal collections in exchange for the transfer of additional credit card receivables into the securitized pool of assets. During the amortization or accumulation period of a securitization, the investors' share of principal collections (in certain cases, up to a maximum specified amount each month) is either distributed to the investors or held in an account until it accumulates to the total amount due, at which time it is paid to the investors in a lump sum. The Company's outstanding securitizations are scheduled to begin their amortization or accumulation periods at various times between 2004 and 2008.
F-14 The following table shows the maturities of borrowing commitments as of December31, 2003 for the WFN Trusts by year: 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Total (in thousands) Public notes $ 900,000 $  $  $ 600,000 $ 600,000 $ 2,100,000 Private conduits 1,289,595 250,000    1,539,595 Total $ 2,189,595 $ 250,000 $  $ 600,000 $ 600,000 $ 3,639,595 "Due from securitizations" consists of: December 31, 2002 2003 (in thousands) Spread deposits $ 104,068 $ 163,225 I/O strips 49,503 58,431 Residual interest in securitization trust 39,919 55,002 Excess funding deposits 42,400 4,120 $ 235,890 $ 280,778 The Company is required to maintain minimum interests ranging from 4% to 6% of the securitized credit card receivables. This requirement is met through seller's interest and is supplemented through the excess funding deposits. Excess funding deposits represent cash amounts deposited with the trustee of the securitizations. Residual interest in securitization represents a subordinated interest in the cash flows of the WFN Trusts.
The spread deposits and I/O strips are initially recorded at their allocated carrying amount based on relative fair value. Fair value is determined by computing the present value of the estimated cash flows, using the dates that such cash flows are expected to be released to the Company, at a discount rate considered to be commensurate with the risks associated with the cash flows. The amounts and timing of the cash flows are estimated after considering various economic factors including payment rates, delinquency, default and loss assumptions. I/O strips, seller's interest and other interests retained are periodically evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of those assets.
Fair values of I/O strips and other interests retained are based on a review of actual cash flows and on the factors that affect the amounts and timing of the cash flows from each of the underlying credit card receivable pools. Based on this analysis, assumptions are validated or revised as deemed necessary, the amounts and the timing of anticipated cash flows are estimated and fair value is determined. The Company has one collateral type, private label credit card receivables.
F-15 At December31, 2003, key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in the assumptions are as follows: Assumption Impact on fair value of 10% change Impact on fair value of 20% change (in thousands) Fair value of I/O strip $ 58,431 Weighted average life 8 months Discount rate 9.0 % $ 129 $ 256 Expected yield, net of dilution 14.4 % 21,274 40,604 Interest expense 1.8 % 228 456 Net charge-offs rate 8.7 % 8,064 16,166 These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the figures indicate, changes in fair value based on a 10percent variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in an assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in this table the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption; in practice, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities.
Spread deposits, carried at estimated fair value, represent deposits that are held by a trustee or agent and are used to absorb shortfalls in the available net cash flows related to securitized credit card receivables if those available net cash flows are insufficient to satisfy certain obligations of the WFN Trusts. The fair value of spread deposits is based on the weighted average life of the underlying securities and the discount rate. The discount rate is based on a risk adjusted rate paid on the series. The amount required to be deposited is approximately 5.5% of the investor's interest in the WFN Trusts. Spread deposits are generally released proportionately as investors are repaid, although some spread deposits are released only when investors have been paid in full. None of these spread deposits were required to be used to cover losses on securitized credit card receivables in the three-year period ended December31, 2003.
The table below summarizes certain cash flows received from and paid to securitization trusts: Year Ended December 31, 2001 2002 2003 (in millions) Proceeds from collections reinvested in previous credit card securitizations $ 3,768.2 $ 4,979.1 $ 5,801.0 Proceeds from new securitizations 900.0 600.1 600.0 Servicing fees received 41.9 46.9 50.5 Other cash flows received on retained interests 134.4 192.0 286.4 F-16 The tables below present quantitative information about the components of total credit card receivables managed, delinquencies and net charge-offs: December 31, 2002 2003 (in millions) Total principal of credit card receivables managed $ 2,797.3 $ 3,302.7 Less credit card receivables securitized 2,775.1 3,186.8 Credit card receivables held 22.2 115.9 Principal amount of credit card receivables 90 days or more past due 64.8 72.5 Year Ended December 31, 2001 2002 2003 (in thousands) Net charge-offs including billed, unpaid finance charges and fees $ 254,698 $ 270,243 $ 299,295 F-17 7.INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL Intangible assets consist of the following: December 31, 2003 Gross Assets Accumulated Amortization Net Amortization Life and Method (in thousands) Premium on purchased credit card portfolios $ 42,142 $ (6,774 ) $ 35,368 3-10 yearsstraight line Customer contracts and lists 131,487 (46,308 ) 85,179 3-20 yearsstraight line Noncompete agreements 4,300 (3,399 ) 901 1-5 yearsstraight line Collector database 53,991 (31,706 ) 22,285 15%declining balance Total intangible assets $ 231,920 $ 88,187 $ 143,733 December 31, 2002 Gross Assets Accumulated Amortization Net Amortization Life and Method (in thousands) Premium on purchased credit card portfolios $ 16,566 $ (7,740 ) $ 8,826 3 yearsstraight line Customer contracts and lists 77,876 (35,112 ) 42,764 3-20 yearsstraight line Noncompete agreements 4,300 (2,295 ) 2,005 1-5 yearsstraight line Sponsor contracts 36,132 (35,900 ) 232 5 yearsdeclining balance Collector database 44,373 (22,801 ) 21,572 15%declining balance Total intangible assets $ 179,247 $ 103,848 $ 75,399 During the third quarter of 2003, the Company completed the acquisition and conversion of approximately $223.6million of receivables associated with Stage Stores,Inc.'s portfolio of approximately 800,000 active private label credit card accounts, and has assumed overall operation of Stage Stores' private label credit card program. The Company paid approximately $236.1million for this portfolio. The preliminary purchase price allocation resulted in identifiable intangible assets of $27.0million that are being amortized over approximately 10years.
The Company capitalizes initial payments for contracts associated with customer processing relationships. In March2003, the Company acquired the contract for utility processing with Centrica and American Electric Power.
F-18 The estimated amortization expense related to intangible assets for the next five years is as follows: For Years Ending December 31, (in thousands) 2004 $ 25,747 2005 25,182 2006 24,316 2007 19,591 2008 17,974 Goodwill The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December31, 2003, are as follows: Transaction Services Credit Services Marketing Services Total (in thousands) Beginning balance $ 281,942 $  $ 147,778 $ 429,720 Goodwill acquired during year 22,765   22,765 Effects of foreign currency translation   32,031 32,031 Other, primarily final purchase price adjustments (101 )   (101 ) Ending balance $ 304,606 $  $ 179,809 $ 484,415 On January1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No.142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. In accordance with the standard, the Company performed a fair value based impairment test on its goodwill and determined that the fair value exceeded the recorded value as of January1, 2002. SFAS No.142 also provides that an entity may select a subsequent date, after adoption of the standard, to serve as the annual review date. The Company has selected July31 as its annual assessment date. Accordingly, the Company completed the most recent annual impairment test for goodwill on July31, 2003 and determined that no impairment exists. No further testing of goodwill impairments will be performed until July31, 2004, unless circumstances exist that indicate that an impairment may have occurred.
F-19 Pro forma net income (loss) and net income per share for the year ended December31, 2001, adjusted to eliminate historical amortization of goodwill, net of tax, and comparable amounts for the years ended December31, 2002 and 2003 are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2001 2002 2003 (in thousands, except per share amounts) Reported income (loss) $ (10,362 ) $ 23,659 $ 67,298 Goodwill amortization, net of tax 14,571   Adjusted net income $ 4,209 $ 23,659 $ 67,298 Basic net income (loss) per share: Reported income (loss) $ (0.21 ) $ 0.32 $ 0.86 Goodwill amortization, net of tax 0.23   Adjusted net income $ 0.02 $ 0.32 $ 0.86 Diluted net income (loss) per share: Reported income (loss) $ (0.21 ) $ 0.31 $ 0.84 Goodwill amortization, net of tax 0.21   Adjusted net income $  $ 0.31 $ 0.84 8.DEFERRED REVENUE A reconciliation of deferred revenue for the AIR MILES Reward Program is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2002 2003 (in thousands) Deferred RevenueService Beginning balance $ 97,574 $ 103,039 Cash proceeds 61,129 69,800 Revenue recognized (51,730 ) (62,958 ) Effects of foreign currency translation (3,934 ) 22,860 Ending balance $ 103,039 $ 132,741 Deferred RevenueRedemption Beginning balance $ 225,953 $ 250,765 Cash proceeds 107,390 137,310 Revenue recognized (86,039 ) (112,769 ) Effects of foreign currency translation 3,461 57,828 Ending balance $ 250,765 $ 333,134 F-20 9.DEBT Debt consists of the following: December 31, 2002 2003 (in thousands) Certificates of deposit $ 96,200 $ 200,400 Subordinated notes 52,000  Credit facility 139,500 179,789 Other 5,211 9,962 292,911 390,151 Less: current portion (184,993 ) (200,790 ) Long term portion $ 107,918 $ 189,361 Certificates of Deposit Terms of the certificates of deposit range from three months to 24months with annual interest rates ranging from 2.0% to 6.1% at December31, 2002 and from 1.5% to 4.0% at December31, 2003. Interest is paid monthly and at maturity.
Subordinated Notes In April2003, the Company repaid a subordinated note with its largest stockholder in the principal amount of $52.0million. Such note bore annual interest at 10% payable semi-annually.
Credit Facility On April10, 2003, the Company entered into three new credit facilities to replace its prior credit facilities. The first facility provides for a $150.0million revolving commitment and matures in April2006. As of December31, 2003, $35.0million was available under this facility. The second facility is a 364-day facility and provides for an additional $150.0million revolving commitment that matures in April2004. As of December31, 2003, no amounts had been drawn against this facility. The third facility provides for a $100.0million revolving commitment to Loyalty Management Group CanadaInc., a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, and matures in April2006. As of December31, 2003, $35.2million was available under this facility. The covenants contained in the three credit facilities are substantially identical to each other and to the covenants contained in the prior credit facilities. The Company is in compliance with its covenants.
Advances under the credit facilities are in the form of either base rate loans or eurodollar loans. The interest rate on base rate loans fluctuates based upon the higher of (1)the interest rate announced by the administrative agent as its "prime rate" or (2)the Federal funds rate plus 0.5%, in each case with no additional margin. The interest rate on eurodollar loans fluctuates based upon the rate at which eurodollar deposits in the London interbank market are quoted plus a margin of 1.0% to 1.5% based upon the ratio of total debt under the credit facilities to Consolidated Operating EBITDA, as each term is defined in the credit facilities. The credit facilities are secured by pledges of stock of certain subsidiaries and pledges of certain intercompany promissory notes.
Other The Company has other minor borrowings, primarily capital leases, with varying interest rates.

In addition, the Company has approximately $395.8million of state NOL's, which expire at various times through 2023. The utilization of $7.9million of the $51.7million federal NOL's is subject to limitations under Section382 F-23 of the Internal Revenue Code on account of changes in the equity ownership. NOL's are subject to a valuation allowance established for the tax benefit associated with their respective unrealizable federal and state NOL's. The valuation allowance relates primarily to state NOL's and reduces deferred tax assets to an amount that represents management's best estimate of the amount of such deferred tax assets that more likely than not will be realized.
The Canadian corporate income tax rates for years beginning in 2001 were decreased. The Company recorded $5.7million and $4.1million of income tax expense in 2001 and 2002, respectively, to reduce the net deferred tax assets in Canada related to the lower income tax rates. In 2003 the Canadian corporate income tax rate was increased for the 2004 tax year. Therefore, in 2003 the Company recorded $2.7million of income tax benefit to increase the deferred tax assets in Canada related to the higher income tax rates.
11.STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY In April2003, the Company completed a public offering of 10,350,000 shares of common stock at $19.65 per share. Limited Commerce Corp. sold 7,000,000 of these shares and the remaining 3,350,000 shares were sold by the Company. The net proceeds to the Company from the offering were $61.9million after deducting offering expenses and its pro-rata underwriting discounts and commissions. Concurrently with the closing of the public offering, the Company used $52.7million of the net proceeds to repay in full $52.0million of debt outstanding, plus accrued interest, under a 10% subordinated note that the Company had issued in September1998 to an affiliated entity of Welsh Carson.
In November2003, the Company facilitated a secondary public offering of 8,663,382 shares of the Company's common stock at $26.95 per share. 7,533,376 shares were sold by the Company's second largest stockholder, Limited Commerce Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Limited Brands, which together with its retail affiliates is our largest customer, and the remaining 1,130,006 shares were sold by the Company's largest stockholder, Welsh Carson, through two of its affiliated entities. The Company sold no stock and received none of the proceeds from the secondary offering. In connection with the secondary offering, the Company incurred approximately $450,000 in registration costs, which were expensed in the fourth quarter. As a result of the secondary offering, Limited Commerce Corp. is no longer a stockholder of the Company.
12.STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS Certain of the Company's employees have been granted stock options under the Company's equity compensation plans. The purpose of such plans is to benefit and advance the interests of the Company by rewarding certain employees for their contributions to the financial success of the Company and thereby motivating them to continue to make such contributions in the future. The stock options generally vest over three years and expire 10 years after the date of grant. Terms of all awards are determined by the Board of Directors or the compensation committee of the Board of Directors or its designee at the time of award.
F-24 The fair value of each option grant utilized for required disclosures is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: Year Ended December 31, 2001 2002 2003 Expected dividend yield    Risk-free interest rate 5.0 % 3.5 % 3.2 % Expected life of options (years) 4.0 4.0 4.0 Assumed volatility 56.2 % 48.0 % 33.9 % Weighted average fair value $ 5.86 $ 7.28 $ 7.54 The following table summarizes stock option activity under the Company's equity compensation plans: Outstanding Exercisable Options Weighted average exercise price Options Weighted average exercise price (in thousands, except per share amounts) Balance at January 1, 2001 4,883 $ 12.45 Granted 2,844 12.13 Exercised (238 ) 10.80 Cancelled (970 ) 13.07 Balance at December 31, 2001 6,519 $ 12.34 2,353 $ 11.34 Granted 1,485 17.59 Exercised (664 ) 11.73 Cancelled (319 ) 13.25 Balance at December 31, 2002 7,021 $ 13.48 3,418 $ 12.04 Granted 1,733 24.05 Exercised (1,393 ) 12.54 Cancelled (289 ) 14.65 Balance at December 31, 2003 7,072 $ 16.20 4,109 $ 16.20 F-25 The following table summarizes information concerning currently outstanding and exercisable stock options at December31, 2003: Outstanding Exercisable Range of exercise prices Options Remaining contractual life (Years) Weighted average exercise price Options Weighted average exercise price (In thousands, except per share amounts) $9.00 to $12.00 2,652 6.2 $ 10.99 2,267 $ 10.82 $12.01 to $15.00 2,137 7.4 $ 14.93 1,631 $ 14.97 $15.01 to $22.00 320 8.6 $ 18.21 110 $ 18.05 $22.01 to $29.00 1,963 9.2 $ 24.28 101 $ 24.56 7,072 4,109 The stock based employee compensation plans also provided for the granting of performance-based restricted stock awards to certain officers of the Company. As of December31, 2003, performance-based restricted stock awards representing an aggregate of 328,432 shares had been granted and were outstanding with 327,480 shares no longer subject to restrictions. The restrictions on the shares subject to these grants will not lapse unless specified performance measures tied to either cash earnings per share or return on stockholders' equity are met. If these performance targets are met, some of these restrictions on the shares will lapse at the end of a three year period. However, the Company's Board of Directors may accelerate the lapsing of such restrictions if certain annual cash earnings per share performance targets are met. During 2001, 2002 and 2003, the Company recognized stock compensation expense of $1.8million, $2.9million and $5.9million, respectively.
13.EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company maintains a 401(k) profit sharing plan, which covers all eligible U.S. employees. Participants can, in accordance with Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") guidelines, set aside both pre and post tax savings in this account. In addition to their own savings, the Company contributes to plan participants' accounts in three different ways. First, each pay period the Company matches dollar for dollar on the first three percent set aside by the participant. Second, in addition to the Company match, participants are eligible once a year at the discretion of the Board of Directors for a match based on the second three percent set aside by the plan participant. Third, the Company contributes to each plan participant's account in the form of a retirement contribution that is formula based, factoring in age and years of service with the Company. The maximum annual retirement contribution an employee could potentially receive is 12% of their eligible pay. The participants in the plan can direct their contributions and the Company's matching contribution to nine investment options, including the Company's common stock. Participant contributions vest immediately and the Company's contributions vest based on a five year vesting service schedule. Company contributions for associates age 65 or older vest immediately. Contributions for the years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 were $6.9million, $8.3million and $9.3million, respectively. The Company also provides a Deferred Profit Sharing Plan for its Canadian employees after one year of service. Company contributions range from one to four percent of earnings, based on years of service.
F-26 The Alliance 401(k) and Retirement Savings Plan was amended effective January1, 2004 to better benefit the majority of Company associates. The new plan is an IRS approved safe harbor plan design that eliminates the need for discrimination testing. Eligible associates can participate in the plan immediately upon joining the Company and after six months of employment begin receiving Company matching contributions. On the first three percent of savings, the Company matches dollar-for-dollar. An additional fifty cents for each dollar associates contribute is matched for savings between four percent and five percent of pay. All Company matching contributions are immediately vested. In addition to the Company match, ADSC annually may make an additional contribution based on the profitability of the Company. This contribution, subject to Board of Directors approval, is based on a percentage of pay and is subject to a separate five year vesting schedule.
In February2001, the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan and reserved 1,500,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the plan. In accordance with IRS regulations, the plan permits our eligible employees and those of our designated subsidiaries to purchase the common stock of the Company at a 15% discount to the fair market value through payroll deductions. No employee may purchase more than $25,000 in stock under the plan in any calendar year. The fair market value is determined each quarter as the lesser of the closing price on the first business day of the quarter or the last business day of the quarter. Approximately 266,700 shares of common stock have been purchased under the plan since its adoption, with approximately 133,300 shares purchased in 2003.
The Company also maintains a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP"). The SERP provides an opportunity for a select group of management and highly compensated employees to defer on a pre-tax basis a portion of their regular compensation and bonuses payable for services rendered and to receive certain employer contributions.
14.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES AIR MILES Reward Program The Company has entered into certain contractual arrangements that result in a fee being billed to sponsors upon redemption of AIR MILES reward miles. The Company has obtained revolving letters of credit from certain of these sponsors for the Company's benefit that expire at various dates. These letters of credit total $93.5million at December31, 2003, which exceeds the estimated amount of the obligation to provide travel and other rewards. The Company currently has an obligation to fund redemption of AIR MILES reward miles as they are redeemed by collectors. The Company believes that the redemption settlement assets are sufficient to meet that obligation.
The Company has entered into certain long-term arrangements to purchase tickets from airlines and other suppliers in connection with redemptions under the AIR MILES Reward Program. These long-term arrangements allow the Company to make purchases at set prices. As a part of the agreement, the Company is required to pay annual minimums of approximately $9.6million to $10.6million. On April1, 2003, Air Canada filed for bankruptcy protection, from which it has not yet emerged, under the Canadian Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act in order to restructure its debt and operations. Air Canada is in the process of reducing its fleet size to match current and anticipated capacity requirements. In connection with Air Canada's bankruptcy proceedings, the Company entered into a new supply agreement with Air Canada effective December15, 2003. If Air Canada sharply reduces its fleet capacity and route network, the Company may not be able to satisfy collectors' demands for airline tickets. Tickets from other airlines, if available, could be more expensive than a F-27 comparable ticket under the Company's Air Canada supply agreement, and the routes offered by the other airlines may be inadequate, inconvenient or undesirable to the redeeming collectors. As a result, collector satisfaction with the AIR MILES Reward Program may be adversely affected by a reduced route network in Canada and the Company may experience higher air travel redemption costs.
Leases The Company leases certain office facilities and equipment under noncancellable operating leases and is generally responsible for property taxes and insurance related to such facilities. Lease expense was $56.9million, $47.3million and $48.2million for the years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively.
Future annual minimum rental payments required under noncancellable operating and capital leases, some of which contain renewal options, as of December31, 2003 are (in thousands): Year: Operating leases 2004 $ 37,061 2005 26,627 2006 21,344 2007 15,133 2008 7,742 Thereafter 8,835 Total $ 116,742 Year: Capital leases 2004 $ 5,649 2005 3,251 2006 1,189 2007 577 2008 281 Thereafter 37 Total 10,984 Less amount representing interest (1,022 ) Total present value of minimum lease payments $ 9,962 Regulatory Matters WFNNB is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, WFNNB must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as F-28 calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.
Before WFNNB can pay dividends to ADSC, it must obtain prior regulatory approval if all dividends declared in any calendar year would exceed its net profits for that year plus its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any transfers to surplus. In addition, WFNNB may only pay dividends to the extent that retained net profits, including the portion transferred to surplus, exceed bad debts. Moreover, to pay any dividend, WFNNB must maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. Further, if a regulatory authority believes that WFNNB is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound banking practice, which, depending on its financial condition, could include the payment of dividends, the authority may require, after notice and hearing, that WFNNB cease and desist from the unsafe practice.
Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require WFNNB to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk weighted assets (as defined) and of Tier 1 capital to average assets (as defined) ("total capital ratio", "Tier 1 capital ratio" and "leverage ratio", respectively). Under the regulations, a "well capitalized" institution must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6%, a total capital ratio of at least 10% and a leverage ratio of at least 5% and not be subject to a capital directive order. An "adequately capitalized" institution must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4%, a total capital ratio of at least 8% and a leverage ratio of at least 4%, but 3% is allowed in some cases. Under these guidelines, WFNNB is considered well capitalized. As of December31, 2003, WFNNB's Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.6%, total capital ratio was 19.7% and leverage ratio was 42.0%, and WFNNB was not subject to a capital directive order.
Cardholders The Company's Credit Services segment is active in originating private label credit cards in the United States. The Company reviews each potential customer's credit application and evaluates the applicant's financial history and ability and perceived willingness to repay. Credit card loans are made primarily on an unsecured basis. Cardholders reside throughout the United States and are not significantly concentrated in any one area.
Holders of credit cards issued by the Company have available lines of credit, which vary by cardholders that can be used for purchases of merchandise offered for sale by clients of the Company. These lines of credit represent elements of risk in excess of the amount recognized in the financial statements. The lines of credit are subject to change or cancellation by the Company. As of December31, 2003, WFNNB had approximately 27.4million cardholders, having unused lines of credit averaging $831 per account.
Other As part of the agreement with Centrica plc, the Company entered into a securities account control agreement in which $10.8million was deposited for the benefit of CPL Retail Energy L.P. and WTU Retail Energy L.P. in case of non-performance on the contract.
F-29 15.FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit through charge cards and interest rate swaps. Such instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. The contract or notional amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of the Company's involvement in particular classes of financial instruments.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments were as follows: December 31, 2002 2003 Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value (in thousands) Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 30,439 $ 30,439 $ 67,745 $ 67,745 Due from card associations 27,294 27,294 7,855 7,855 Trade receivables 89,097 89,097 125,396 125,396 Seller's interest and credit card receivables, net 147,899 147,899 271,396 271,396 Redemption settlement assets 166,293 166,293 215,271 215,271 Due from securitizations 235,890 235,890 280,778 280,778 Financial liabilities Accounts payable 72,586 72,586 71,727 71,727 Merchant settlement obligations 49,063 49,063 56,904 56,904 Derivatives 13,040 13,040 4,887 4,887 Debt 292,911 292,911 390,151 390,151 The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair values of financial instruments as disclosed herein: Cash and cash equivalents, due from card associations, trade receivables, accounts payable, and merchant settlement obligations The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short maturity.
Seller's interest and credit card receivables The carrying amount of credit card receivables approximates fair value due to the short maturity, and the average interest rates approximate current market origination rates.
Redemption settlement assets Fair value for securities are based on quoted market prices.
Due from securitizations The spread deposits and I/O strips are recorded at their fair value. The carrying amount of excess funding deposits approximates its fair value due to the relatively short maturity period and average interest rates, which approximate current market rates.
Derivatives The fair value was estimated based on the cost to the Company to terminate the agreements.
Debt The fair value was estimated based on the current rates available to the Company for debt with similar remaining maturities.
F-30 16.DERIVATIVES The following briefly outlines the terms of borrowing related derivative financial instruments as of December31, 2003: Outstanding Notional Amount Maturity Date Variable rate received Fixed rate paid Interest rate derivative $ 200,000,000 May 15, 2004 LIBOR 6.720 % The Company utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to enhance its ability to manage risks that exist as part of ongoing business operations. Effective January1, 2001, with the adoption of SFAS No.133, the Company recognizes all derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value. The estimated fair value of the derivatives is based primarily on dealer quotations. The Company presently uses derivatives to mitigate cash flow risks with respect to changes in interest rates. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as a hedge of a forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge) or as a hedge of a change in fair value (fair value hedge). Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge are generally recorded immediately in earnings along with the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item. Amounts on the balance sheet are recorded as a component of "Other liabilities." Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is not designated as a hedge are recorded immediately in earnings. Derivative instruments are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The Company does not enter into contracts for speculative purposes.
The Company's policy is to minimize its cash flow exposure to adverse changes in interest rates. The Company's objective is to engage in risk management strategies that provide adequate downside protection. The Company does not believe that its derivative financial instruments expose it to more than a nominal amount of credit risk, as the counterparties are established, well-capitalized financial institutions with a major rating agency credit rating of "A" or better. The credit risk inherent in these agreements represents the possibility that a loss may occur from the non-performance of a counterparty to the agreements.
SFAS No.133, as amended, specifies criteria that must be met in order to apply any of the three forms of hedge accounting. The Company uses derivatives to hedge exposures when it makes economic sense to do so, including circumstances in which the hedging relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. The Company has an interest rate swap agreement, which serves to effectively convert the variable rates on debt related to World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust to fixed rate amounts but which does not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No.133, as amended. Under SFAS No.133, as amended, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market through earnings. The aggregate notional amount of the interest rate swap agreement was $200.0million. The swap term ends mid-2004.
Upon adoption of SFAS No.133, as amended, the Company recorded a transition adjustment to other comprehensive income of $4.0million, net of tax, to recognize the fair value loss for derivatives that existed at that time. The Company recognized approximately $13.0million, $10.2million, and $1.1million, before tax, in additional fair value losses related to this agreement for the years ended F-31 December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. During the year ending December31, 2004, approximately $0.7million, net of tax, of losses in other comprehensive income (loss) related to the interest rate swap are expected to be reclassified as interest expense.

The Company's chief operating decision making group is the Executive Committee, which consists of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Presidents of the divisions, and Executive Vice Presidents. The operating segments are reviewed separately because each operating segment represents a strategic business unit that generally offers different products and serves different markets.
The Company operates in three reportable segments: Transaction Services, Credit Services and Marketing Services.
Transaction Services encompasses card processing, billing and payment processing and customer care for specialty and petroleum retailers (issuer services), customer information system hosting, customer care and billing and payment processing for regulated and de-regulated utilities (utility services) and point-of-sale services (merchant services).
Credit Services provides private label receivables financing. Credit Services generally securitizes the credit card receivables that it underwrites from its private label programs.
Marketing Services provides loyalty programs such as the AIR MILES Reward Program and other marketing services.
The Transaction Services segment performs card processing and servicing activities related to the Credit Services segment. For this, the Transaction Services segment receives a fee equal to its direct costs before corporate overhead plus a margin. The margin is based on current market rates for similar services. This fee represents an operating cost to the Credit Services segment and a corresponding revenue for the Transaction Services segment. Inter-segment sales are eliminated upon consolidation. Revenues earned by the Transaction Services segment from servicing the Credit Services segment, and consequently paid by the Credit Services segment to the Transaction Services segment, are set forth opposite "Other and eliminations" in the tables below.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are generally the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Corporate overhead is allocated across the segments.
F-34 Interest expense and income taxes are not allocated to the segments in the computation of segment operating profit for internal evaluation purposes.
