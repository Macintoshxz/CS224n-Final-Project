Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules 192 Signatures 196 Financial Statement Schedules S-1 PartI Item1.Business The Allstate Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November5, 1992 to serve as the holding company for Allstate Insurance Company. Its business is conducted principally through Allstate Insurance Company, Allstate Life Insurance Company and their affiliates (collectively, including The Allstate Corporation, "Allstate"). Allstate is engaged in the personal property and casualty insurance business and the life insurance, retirement and investment products business. It conducts its business primarily in the United States.
The Allstate Corporation is the largest publicly held personal lines insurer in the United States. Widely known through the "You're In Good Hands With Allstate" slogan, Allstate provides insurance products to more than 16million households and has approximately 13,600 exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists in the United States and Canada. Allstate is the second-largest personal property and casualty insurer in the United States on the basis of 2003 statutory premiums earned. In addition, it is the nation's 12th largest life insurance business on the basis of 2003 ordinary life insurance in force and 19th largest on the basis of 2003 statutory admitted assets.
Allstate has four business segments: Allstate Protection Discontinued Lines and Coverages Allstate Financial Corporate and Other In this annual report on Form10-K, we occasionally refer to statutory financial information that has been prepared in accordance with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") Accounting Practices and Procedure Manual. All domestic U.S. insurance companies are required to prepare statutory-basis financial statements in accordance with the Manual. As a result, industry data is available on a widespread basis that enables comparisons between insurance companies, including competitors that are not subject to the requirement to publish financial statements on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"). We frequently use industry publications containing statutory financial information to assess our competitive position.
Allstate's goal is to become better, bigger and broader in personal property and casualty insurance and in life insurance, retirement and investment products.
To achieve this goal, Allstate will help customers feel better protected today and better prepared for tomorrow by delivering on the Good Hands Promise. The Good Hands Promise is made up of five planks that reflect what Allstate stands for:  Have competitive prices  Be easy to do business with  Offer products and services to help meet customer needs  Provide a knowledgeable and experienced team  Establish relationships that value customers In pursuit of our goal to become better, bigger and broader, we intend to maintain discipline in pricing, underwriting, capital, expense and risk management in order to create long-term shareholder value. We may also engage in selective business start-ups, acquisitions and alliances.
1 ALLSTATE PROTECTION SEGMENT Products and Distribution Our Allstate Protection segment accounted for 93% of Allstate's 2004 consolidated insurance premiums and contract charges. In this segment, we sell principally private passenger auto and homeowners insurance, primarily through agencies. These products are marketed under the Allstate, Encompass SM and Deerbrook brand names.
Allstate brand auto and homeowners insurance products are sold primarily through Allstate exclusive agencies and, to a lesser extent, through independent agencies in areas not served by exclusive agencies. Encompass brand auto and homeowners insurance products as well as Deerbrook brand auto insurance products are sold through independent agencies.
In states where we have implemented The Good Hands Network, consumers can also purchase certain Allstate brand personal insurance products and obtain service through our Customer Information Centers and, in many of those states, over the Internet.
Our broad-based network of approximately 11,900 Allstate exclusive agencies in approximately 10,400 locations in the U.S. produced approximately 80% of the Allstate Protection segment's written premiums in 2004. The rest was generated primarily by approximately 13,700 independent agencies. We are among the five largest providers of personal property and casualty insurance products through independent agencies in the United States, based on statutory written premium information published byA.M. Best for 2003 and our analysis of publicly available GAAP financial statements of our principal competitors in the independent agency channel.
We also sell a variety of other personal property and casualty insurance products, including landlords, personal umbrella, renters, condominium, residential fire, manufactured housing, boat owners and selected commercial property and casualty and we participate in the "involuntary" or "shared" private passenger auto insurance business in order to maintain our licenses to do business in many states. Through Allstate Motor Club,Inc. we also provide travel plans and emergency road service.
Competition The markets for personal private passenger auto and homeowners insurance are highly competitive. The following charts provide the market shares of our principal competitors in the U.S. by direct written premium for the year ended December31, 2003 (the most recent date such competitive information is available) according to A. M. Best.
Private Passenger Auto Insurance Homeowners Insurance Insurer Market Share Insurer Market Share State Farm 19.4 % State Farm 22.8 % Allstate* 10.9 % Allstate* 12.2 % Progressive 6.7 % Farmers 7.7 % Farmers 5.0 % Nationwide 4.7 % Geico 5.0 % USAA 3.7 % Nationwide 4.7 % Travelers 3.6 % * Allstate's market shares, above, are the sum of the market shares reported byA.M. Best for Allstate Insurance Group and for the personal lines insurance business of CNA Insurance Companies, which Allstate acquired in 1999.
In the personal property and casualty insurance market, we compete principally on the basis of the recognition of our brands, the scope of our distribution system, price, the breadth of our product offerings, product features, customer service, claim handling, and use of technology. In addition, our proprietary database of underwriting and pricing experience enables Allstate to use "tiered pricing," to divide the market into segments, to appropriately price risks and to cross sell products within our 2 customer base. "Tiered pricing" is the term that we use to describe our sophisticated process for segmenting a market.
Tiered pricing and related underwriting and marketing programs use a number of risk evaluation factors. For auto insurance these factors include, to the extent legally permissible, loss history, driving record, car year and make, marital status, and insurance scoring based on credit report information. For property insurance these factors include, to the extent legally permissible, loss history, property condition, proximity to a fire department, and insurance scoring based on credit report information.
Our primary focus in using tiered pricing has been on acquiring and retaining new business. The program is designed to enhance Allstate's competitive position with respect to "high lifetime value" market segments while maintaining or improving profitability. "Lifetime value" is the discounted value of a customer's future cash flow stream. To estimate a customer's lifetime value score, we analyze characteristics about the customer (for example, age, marital status and driving record) and characteristics about the product the customer has purchased (for example, coverages, limits, and descriptors of the asset insured) on the basis of historic data patterns and trends. Because future loss and retention patterns of customers vary significantly, the distribution of lifetime values for a large group of customers will vary from very negative to very positive. "High lifetime value" generally refers to customers who potentially present favorable prospects for profitability over the course of their relationships with us.
Geographic Markets The principal geographic markets for our auto, homeowners and other personal property and casualty products are in the United States. Through various subsidiaries, we are authorized to sell various types of personal property and casualty insurance products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. We also sell personal property and casualty insurance products in Canada through a distribution system similar to that used in the United States.
The following table reflects, in percentages, the principal geographic distribution of premiums earned for the Allstate Protection segment for the year ended December31, 2004. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than five percent of the premiums earned for the segment.
Texas 10.9 % California 10.6 % New York 10.5 % Florida 9.7 % Our underwriting strategy for homeowners insurance is to target customers whose risk of loss provides Allstate with the best opportunity for profitable growth. This includes managing exposure on policies in geographic areas where the potential loss from catastrophes exceeds acceptable levels.
Additional Information Information regarding the last three years' revenues and income from operations attributable to the Allstate Protection segment is contained in Note18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Note18 also includes information regarding the last three years' identifiable assets attributable to our property-liability operations, which includes our Allstate Protection segment and our Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment. Note18 is incorporated in this PartI, Item1 by reference.
Information regarding the amount of premium earned for Allstate Protection segment products for the last three years is set forth in PartII, Item7Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, page38, in the table regarding premiums earned by brand. That table is incorporated in this PartI, Item1 by reference.
3 ALLSTATE FINANCIAL SEGMENT Products and Distribution Our Allstate Financial segment provides life insurance, retirement and investment products to individual and institutional customers. Our principal products are deferred and immediate fixed annuities, variable annuities, interest-sensitive and traditional life insurance, and supplemental accident and health insurance. Our principal institutional product is funding agreements backing medium term notes. The table on page5 lists our major distribution channels for this segment, with the associated products and targeted customers.
As the table indicates, we sell Allstate Financial products to individuals through multiple intermediary distribution channels, including Allstate exclusive agencies, independent agents, banks, broker-dealers, and specialized structured settlement brokers. We have distribution relationships with over half of the 75 largest banks, most of the national broker-dealers, a number of regional brokerage firms and many independent broker-dealers. We sell products through independent agents affiliated with approximately 160 master brokerage agencies. Independent workplace enrolling agents and Allstate exclusive agencies also sell our supplemental accident and health insurance products to employees of small and medium size firms. We sell funding agreements to unaffiliated trusts used to back medium term notes issued to institutional and individual investors.

In addition, with respect to variable annuity and variable life insurance products in particular, we compete on the basis of the variety of fund managers and choices of funds for our separate accounts and the management and performance of those funds within our separate accounts. With regard to funding agreements, we compete principally on the basis of our financial strength and ratings.
The market for life insurance, retirement and investment products continues to be highly fragmented and competitive. As of December31, 2004, there were approximately 770 groups of life insurance companies in the United States, most of which offered one or more similar products. Based on information contained in statements filed with state insurance departments, as of December31, 2003, the Allstate Financial segment ranked 12th based on ordinary life insurance in force and 19th based on statutory admitted assets. In addition, because many of these products include a savings or investment component, our competition includes domestic and foreign securities firms, investment advisors, mutual funds, banks and other financial institutions. Competitive pressure is growing due to several factors, including cross marketing alliances between unaffiliated businesses, as well as consolidation activity in the financial services industry.
Our website for financial professionals, accessallstate.com, won DALBAR's Communications Seal in 2004. DALBAR,Inc., an independent financial services research organization, recognized accessallstate.com for providing a means by which financial professionals can easily and conveniently develop and manage their business online.
Geographic Markets We sell life insurance, retirement and investment products throughout the United States. Through subsidiaries, we are authorized to sell various types of these products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. We sell funding agreements in the United States and in the Cayman Islands.
The following table reflects, in percentages, the principal geographic distribution of statutory premiums and annuity considerations for the Allstate Financial segment for the year ended December31, 2004, based on information contained in statements filed with state insurance departments. Approximately 99.0% of the statutory premiums and annuity considerations generated in Delaware represent deposits received in connection with funding agreements sold to trusts domiciled in Delaware. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than five percent of the statutory premiums and annuity considerations.
Delaware 25.2 % New York 8.8 % California 8.2 % Florida 5.6 % Additional Information Information regarding the last three years' revenues and income from operations attributable to the Allstate Financial segment is contained in Note18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Note18 also includes information regarding the last three years' identifiable assets attributable to the Allstate Financial segment. Note18 is incorporated in this PartI, Item1 by reference.
Information regarding premiums and contract charges for Allstate Financial segment products for the last three years is set forth in PartII, Item7Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 6 Condition and Results of Operations, page62, in the table that summarizes premiums and contract charges by product.

OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS Our Corporate and Other segment is comprised of holding company activities and certain non-insurance operations. Note18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contains information regarding the revenues, income from operations, and identifiable assets attributable to our Corporate and Other segment over the last three years.
Our Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other business in run-off.

Note18 is incorporated in this PartI, Item1 by reference.
RESERVE FOR PROPERTY-LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS EXPENSE The following information regarding reserves applies to all of our property-liability operations, encompassing both the Allstate Protection segment and the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.
7 Reconciliation of Claims Reserves The following tables are summary reconciliations of the beginning and ending property-liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves, displayed individually for each of the last three years. The first table presents reserves on a gross (before reinsurance) basis. The end of year gross reserve balances are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The second table presents reserves on a net (after reinsurance) basis. The total net property-liability insurance claims and claims expense amounts are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Year Ended December 31, GROSS ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Gross reserve for property-liability claims and claims expense, beginning of year $ 17,714 $ 16,690 $ 16,500 Incurred claims and claims expense Provision attributable to the current year 18,994 17,183 17,237 Change in provision attributable to prior years 448 704 765 Total claims and claims expense 19,442 17,887 18,002 Claim payments Claims and claims expense attributable to current year 11,494 10,240 10,690 Claims and claims expense attributable to prior years 6,324 6,623 7,122 Total payments 17,818 16,863 17,812 Gross reserve for property-liability claims and claims expense, end of year as shown on 10-K loss reserve development table $ 19,338 $ 17,714 $ 16,690 Year Ended December 31, NET ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Net reserve for property-liability claims and claims expense, beginning of year $ 15,980 $ 15,018 $ 14,833 Incurred claims and claims expense Provision attributable to the current year 18,073 17,031 16,972 Change in provision attributable to prior years (230 ) 401 685 Total claims and claims expense 17,843 17,432 17,657 Claim payments Claims and claims expense attributable to current year 10,989 10,195 10,598 Claims and claims expense attributable to prior years 6,073 6,275 6,874 Total payments 17,062 16,470 17,472 Net reserve for property-liability claims and claims expense, end of year as shown on 10-K loss reserve development table (1) $ 16,761 $ 15,980 $ 15,018 (1) Reserves for claims and claims expense are net of reinsurance of $2.58billion, $1.73billion, and $1.67billion at December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
8 The year-end 2004 gross reserves of $19.34billion for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense, as determined under GAAP, were $3.72billion more than the net reserve balance of $15.62billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory authorities. The principal differences are reinsurance recoverables from third parties totaling $2.58billion that reduce reserves for statutory reporting and are recorded as assets for GAAP reporting, and a liability for the reserves of the Canadian subsidiaries for $840million. Remaining differences are due to variations in requirements between GAAP, and statutory reporting.
As the tables above illustrate, Allstate's net reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of 2003 decreased in 2004 by $230million, compared to reestimates of the gross reserves of an increase of $448million. Net reserve reestimates in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were lower than the gross reserve reestimates due to reinsurance cessions on gross reserve reestimates.
Loss Reserve Reestimates The following Loss Reserve Reestimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of the last eleven calendar years. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows retroactive reestimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of Allstate's expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established, and indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims. The table also presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation period, with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable. The Loss Reserve Reestimates table is cumulative and, therefore, ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years.

The decrease in net reserves established for December31, 2003 reflects favorable reestimates as more fully discussed below.
The following table is derived from the Loss Reserve Reestimates table and summarizes the effect of reserve reestimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations for the ten-year period ended December31, 2004.

The favorable severity trend during this period was primarily the result of favorable injury severity trends, as compared to our anticipated trends. Favorable injury severity trends were largely due to more moderate medical cost inflation and the mitigating effects of our loss management programs.
The impacts of more moderate medical cost inflation have emerged over time as actual claim settlements validate its magnitude. Beginning in the early 1990s, lower medical cost inflation rates, as evidenced by the consumer price index ("CPI") published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for medical costs, have contributed to lower actual claim settlements than prior estimates. From 1991 through 1995, the medical CPI averaged 6.3%, and from 1996 through 2000, the average declined to 3.4%. The medical CPI is considered a viable indicator of the direction of claim costs because it is a measure of the change in various costs for medical services and supplies, including doctors' fees, emergency care, therapy and rehabilitation, and pharmaceuticals, all of which are covered claims for insureds. In 2004, the medical CPI increased to 4.4%, and most recent economic forecasts anticipate further increases in medical inflation. If this occurs, future reserve reestimates could be adversely impacted if actual results exceed reserve estimates.
Our loss management programs over time have had a mitigating effect in a variety of aspects on injury severity trends. We have been improving the claim adjudication processes by implementing programs to accomplish better investigation of claims, consistent handling of soft tissue injury claims, 11 more accurate valuation of damages, and more effective negotiation and defense practices. These improvements have also involved hiring additional staff, providing increased training, creating specialized units of expert employees to handle specific types of claims, and focusing attention and resources on handling specific types of claims such as soft tissue injury claims, claims with attorney involvement, and claims in litigation. These programs were intended to create an improved culture, focused on expert, efficient, and effective claim process management. Since 1993, growth of Allstate's injury claim costs has compared favorably to published insurance industry competitor results. We believe this experience is substantially due to the claim adjudication process improvements, and is an additional factor contributing to reductions in reserve estimates. While changes to the claim settlement process have mitigated increases in severity trends on closed claims, these changes can impact historical patterns of losses, introducing a greater degree of statistical variability in actuarial reserve estimates for the remaining outstanding claims.
In 2004, we decreased our reserve estimates for prior years. Favorable reserve estimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was less than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates. Decreased reserve reestimates for Allstate Protection more than offset increased estimates of losses primarily related to asbestos and environmental liabilities in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.
In 2003 and 2002, we increased our reserve estimates for prior years. Unfavorable reserve reestimates in 2003, were due to favorable Allstate Protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than previous estimates, offset by unfavorable increases primarily related to asbestos and other discontinued lines. Unfavorable reserve reestimates in 2002 were due to claim severity and late reported losses for Allstate Protection that were greater than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates and to increased estimates of losses primarily related to asbestos and environmental liabilities in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.
In 2001, we increased our reserve estimates for prior years due to greater volume of late reported weather related losses than expected from the end of the year 2000 which were reported in the year 2001, additional incurred losses on the 1994 Northridge earthquake, adverse results of class action and other litigation, upward reestimates of property losses and upward reestimates of losses in the Encompass and Canadian businesses For additional information regarding reserves, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsProperty-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves." REGULATION Allstate is subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the state level. The method, extent and substance of such regulation varies by state but generally has its source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to a state regulatory agency. In general, such regulation is intended for the protection of those who purchase or use insurance products issued by our subsidiaries, not the holders of securities issued by The Allstate Corporation. These rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters including insurance company licensing and examination, agent and adjuster licensing, price setting, trade practices, policy forms, accounting methods, the nature and amount of investments, claims practices, participation in shared markets and guaranty funds, reserve adequacy, insurer solvency, transactions with affiliates, the payment of dividends, and underwriting standards. Some of these matters are discussed in more detail below. For a discussion of statutory financial information, see Note15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of regulatory contingencies, see Note13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Notes13 and 15 are incorporated in this PartI, Item1 by reference.
In recent years the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny. Legislation that would provide for federal chartering of insurance companies has been proposed. In 12 addition, state legislators and insurance regulators continue to examine the appropriate nature and scope of state insurance regulation. We cannot predict whether any specific state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of the insurance business or what effect any such measures would have on Allstate.
Catastrophe Exposure Management.
Allstate continues to evaluate its exposure to catastrophes and our countrywide catastrophe risk management strategies for hurricanes and earthquakes. Following the 2004 hurricane season, the state of Florida has taken actions that could negatively impact our level of homeowners premiums written and our profitability, including changing to seasonal hurricane deductibles, discouraging insurance companies from increasing rates and not allowing non-renewal of policies. Separately, we are advancing proposals for legislative reform in Florida. We cannot predict what will emerge from the legislative process.
Agent and Broker Compensation.
A number of states are considering new legislation or regulations regarding the compensation of agents and brokers by insurance companies. The rules that would be imposed if these proposals were adopted range in nature from disclosure requirements to rules that would impose new duties on insurance agents and brokers in dealing with customers. Because these proposals are in the early stages of development, we cannot predict their potential impact on our business.
Limitations on Dividends By Insurance Subsidiaries.
As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, The Allstate Corporation relies on dividends from Allstate Insurance Company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations, including the payment of principal and interest on debt. Allstate Insurance Company is regulated as an insurance company in Illinois and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by Illinois law. For additional information regarding those restrictions, see PartII, Item5 of this report. The laws of the other jurisdictions that generally govern our insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends and in some jurisdictions the laws may be more restrictive.
Holding Company Regulation.
The Allstate Corporation and Allstate Insurance Company are insurance holding companies subject to regulation throughout the jurisdictions in which their insurance subsidiaries do business. In the U.S., these subsidiaries are organized under the insurance codes of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas. Generally, the insurance codes in these states provide that the acquisition or change of "control" of a domestic insurer or of any person that controls a domestic insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulator. In general, a presumption of "control" arises from the ownership, control, possession with the power to vote, or possession of proxies with respect to, ten percent or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurer or of a person that controls a domestic insurer. In addition, certain state insurance laws require pre-acquisition notification to state agencies of a change in control with respect to a non-domestic insurance company licensed to do business in that state. While such pre-acquisition notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control, such statutes do authorize certain remedies, including the issuance of a cease and desist order with respect to the non-domestic insurer if certain conditions exist, such as undue market concentration. Thus, any transaction involving the acquisition of ten percent or more of The Allstate Corporation's common stock would generally require prior approval by the state insurance departments in California, Illinois, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas. The prior approval of the Florida insurance department would be necessary for the acquisition of five percent or more. Moreover, notification would be required in those other states that have adopted pre-acquisition notification provisions and where the insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business. Such approval requirements may deter, delay or prevent certain transactions affecting the ownership of The Allstate Corporation's common stock.
13 Price Regulation.
Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file price schedules, policy or coverage forms, and other information with the state's regulatory authority. In many cases, such price schedules, policy forms or both must be approved prior to use. While they vary from state to state, the objectives of the pricing laws are generally the same: a price cannot be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.
The speed with which an insurer can change prices in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends, in part, on whether the pricing laws are (i)prior approval, (ii)file-and-use, or (iii)use-and-file laws. In states having prior approval laws, the regulator must approve a price before the insurer may use it. In states having file-and-use laws, the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator's approval to use a price, but the price must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used. A use-and-file law requires an insurer to file prices within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them. Approximately one half of the states, including California and New York, have prior approval laws. Under all three types of pricing laws, the regulator has the authority to disapprove a price subsequent to its filing.
An insurer's ability to adjust its prices in response to competition or to increasing costs is often dependent on an insurer's ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its pricing or proposed pricing meets the requirements of the pricing laws. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer's discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite, an insurer can manage its risk of loss by charging a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer's ability to charge a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance, the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites. When a state significantly restricts both underwriting and pricing, it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability.
Changes in Allstate's claim settlement process may require Allstate to actuarially adjust loss information used in its pricing process. Some state insurance regulatory authorities may not approve price increases that give full effect to these adjustments.
From time to time, the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators and special interest groups to reduce, freeze or set prices at levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses. Homeowners insurance comes under similar pressure, particularly as regulators in states subject to high levels of catastrophe losses struggle to identify an acceptable methodology to price for catastrophe exposure. We expect this kind of pressure to persist. In addition, our use of insurance scoring based on credit report information for underwriting and pricing regularly comes under attack by regulators, legislators and special interest groups in various states. The result could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects the profitability of the Allstate Protection segment. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding pricing.
Involuntary Markets.
As a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states, we are required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Underwriting results related to these arrangements, which tend to be adverse, have been immaterial to our results of operations.
Guaranty Funds.
Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, in order to cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies.
Investment Regulation.
Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that limit the amount of investment in certain categories. Failure to 14 comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non-conforming investments as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus. Further, in some instances, these rules require divestiture of non-conforming investments. As of December31, 2004 the investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries complied with such laws and regulations in all material respects.
Exiting Geographic Markets; Canceling and Non-Renewing Policies.
Most states regulate an insurer's ability to exit a market. For example, some states limit a private passenger auto insurer's ability to cancel and non-renew policies. Some states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department and not disapproved on the grounds that it could lead to market disruption. Regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer's ability to exit unprofitable markets.
Variable Life Insurance, Variable Annuities and Registered Fixed Annuities.
The sale of variable life insurance, variable annuities and registered fixed annuities with market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the federal and state level, including regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers.
Broker-Dealers, Investment Advisors and Investment Companies.
The Allstate entities that operate as broker-dealers, registered investment advisors and investment companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers and/or, in some cases, state securities administrators.
Regulation and Legislation Affecting Consolidation in the Financial Services Industry.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 permits mergers that combine commercial banks, insurers and securities firms within one holding company group. In addition, it allows grandfathered unitary thrift holding companies, including our parent company, to engage in activities that are not financial in nature. The ability of banks to affiliate with insurers may materially adversely affect our business by substantially increasing the number, size and financial strength of potential competitors.
Banking.
The Allstate Corporation is a diversified savings and loan holding company for Allstate Bank, a federal stock savings bank and a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). The principal supervisory authority for the diversified savings and loan holding company activities and the bank is the Office of Thrift Supervision. The bank is also subject to the authority of the FDIC and other federal financial regulators implementing various laws applicable to banking.
Privacy Regulation.
Federal law and the laws of some states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of customer information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. Federal law and the laws of some states also regulate disclosures of customer information. Congress, state legislatures and regulatory authorities are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information.
Asbestos.
Recently, President Bush announced his support of efforts to pass meaningful federal reform to address asbestos claims and litigation. Congress has considered such legislation in the past, but unified support among various defendant and insurer groups considered essential to any possible reform has been lacking. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos.
Environmental.
Environmental pollution clean-up of polluted waste sites is the subject of both federal and state regulation. The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("Superfund") and comparable state statutes ("mini-Superfund") govern the clean-up and 15 restoration of waste sites by "Potentially Responsible Parties" (PRPs). Superfund and the mini-Superfunds (Environmental Clean-up Laws or ECLs) establish a mechanism to pay for clean-up of waste sites if PRPs fail to do so and to assign liability to PRPs. The extent of liability to be allocated to a PRP is dependent on a variety of factors. By some estimates, there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to clean-up, but the exact number is unknown. The extent of clean-up necessary and the process of assigning liability remain in dispute. The insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues arising out of the clean-up of waste sites by insured PRPs and insured parties' alleged liability to third parties responsible for the clean-up. The insurance industry, including Allstate, is disputing many such claims. Key coverage issues include whether Superfund response, investigation and clean-up costs are considered damages under the policies, trigger of coverage, applicability of several types of pollution exclusions, proper notice of claims, whether administrative liability triggers the duty to defend, appropriate allocation of liability among triggered insurers, and whether the liability in question falls within the definition of an "occurrence." Identical coverage issues exist for clean-up and waste sites not covered under Superfund. To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues. Allstate's exposure to liability with regard to its insureds that have been, or may be, named as PRPs is uncertain. Comprehensive Superfund reform proposals have been introduced in Congress, but only modest reform measures have been enacted.

In the twelve-month period ending December31, 2004, Allstate Insurance Company paid dividends of $2.49billion. Based on the greater of 2004 statutory net income or 10% of statutory surplus, the maximum amount of dividends that Allstate Insurance Company will be able to pay without prior Illinois Department of Insurance approval at a given point in time in 2005 is $3.86billion, less dividends paid during the preceding twelve months measured at that point in time. Notification and approval of intercompany lending activities is also required by the Illinois Department of Insurance for those transactions that exceed formula amounts based on statutory admitted assets and statutory surplus.

Previously, the trust preferred securities were reported in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust and the dividends reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trust. The impact of deconsolidation was to increase long-term debt and decrease mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust by $200million. Prior periods have not been restated to reflect this change.
(2) We use operating ratios to measure the profitability of our Property-Liability results. We believe that they enhance an investor's understanding of our profitability. They are calculated as follows: Claims and claims expense ("loss") ratiothe ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned. Loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses; Expense ratiothe ratio of amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned; Combined ratiothe ratio of claims and claims expense, amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. The difference between 100% and the combined ratio represents underwriting income as a percentage of premiums earned.

It should be read in conjunction with the 5-year summary of selected financial data, consolidated financial statements and related notes found under PartII, Item 6 and Item 8 contained herein. Further analysis of our insurance segments is provided in Property-Liability Operations (which includes the Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments) and in Allstate Financial Operations (which represents the Allstate Financial segment) sections of Management's Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A"). The segments are consistent with the way in which we use financial information to evaluate business performance and to determine the allocation of resources.
The most important matters that we monitor to evaluate the financial condition and performance of our company include:  For Allstate Protection: written premium growth, changes in the number of policies in force, price changes, claim frequency and severity trends, catastrophes, expenses and underwriting results;  For Allstate Financial: premiums, deposits, gross margin including investment and benefit margins, the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, expenses, operating income, and invested assets;  For Investments: credit quality/experience, stability of long-term returns, cash flows and asset and liability duration;  For financial condition: our financial strength ratings, operating leverage and debt leverage; and  For product distribution: profitably growing distribution partner relationships and Allstate agent sales of all products and services.
Net income increased in 2004 over 2003 due to higher Property-Liability net income. Net income increased in 2003 compared to 2002 due to higher Property-Liability and Allstate Financial net income. For further discussion of the results of our insurance segments, see the Property-Liability and Allstate Financial Highlights sections of this MD&A.
2004 HIGHLIGHTS  Net income increased 17.6% to $3.18billion and net income per diluted share increased to $4.54.
Total revenues reached a record $33.94billion, an increase of 5.6% compared to last year.
Property-Liability premiums earned increased 5.3% to $25.99billion. The combined ratio improved 1.6 points to 93.0.
Pre-tax catastrophe losses in 2004 totaled $2.47billion, primarily due to multiple hurricanes in the third quarter of 2004, with an impact to the combined ratio of 9.5 points, compared to $1.49billion in 2003, with a combined ratio impact of 6.0 points.
Allstate Financial investments increased 15.3% due to the investment of cash provided by operating and financing activities, which included record annual contractholder fund deposits.
The $1.5billion share repurchase program was completed in December2004 and a total of $1.35billion in shares were repurchased during the year. We announced a $4.0billion share repurchase program to be completed in 2006.
Book value per share increased 9.2% to $31.72.
Return on equity improved 0.8 points to 15.0%.

It is reasonably likely that changes in these assumptions and estimates could occur from period to period and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. A brief summary of each of these critical accounting policies follows. For a more complete discussion of the effect of these policies on our consolidated financial statements, and the judgments and estimates relating to these policies, see the referenced sections of the MD&A. For a complete summary of our significant accounting policies see Note2 of the consolidated financial statements.
Investment Valuation The fair value of publicly traded fixed income and equity securities is based on independent market quotations, whereas the fair value of non-publicly traded securities is based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models which use internally developed ratings and independent third party data as inputs or independent third party pricing sources. Factors used in our internally 24 developed models, such as liquidity risk associated with privately-placed securities, are difficult to independently observe and to quantify. Because of this, judgment is required in developing certain of these estimates and, as a result, the estimated fair value of non-publicly traded securities may differ from amounts that would be realized upon an immediate sale of the securities.
Periodic changes in fair values of investments classified as available for sale are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and are not reflected in the operating results of any period until reclassified to net income upon the consummation of a transaction with an unrelated third party, or when declines in fair values are deemed other than temporary. The assessment of other than temporary impairment of a security's fair value is performed on a case-by-case basis considering a wide range of factors. There are a number of assumptions and estimates inherent in assessing impairments and determining if they are other than temporary, including 1)our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; 2)the expected recoverability of principal and interest; 3)the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities; 4)the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects of the issuer, including relevant industry conditions and trends, and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices; and 5)the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position, including market conditions which could affect liquidity. Additionally, once assumptions and estimates are made, any number of changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to later determine that an impairment is other than temporary, including 1)general economic conditions that are worse than previously assumed or that have a greater adverse effect on a particular issuer than originally estimated; 2)changes in the facts and circumstances related to a particular issuer's ability to meet all of its contractual obligations; and 3)changes in facts and circumstances or new information that we obtain which causes a change in our ability or intent to hold a security to maturity or until it recovers in value. Changes in assumptions, facts and circumstances could result in additional charges to earnings in future periods to the extent that losses are realized. The charge to earnings, while potentially significant to net income, would not have a significant effect on shareholders' equity since the majority of our portfolio is held at fair value and as a result, any related unrealized loss, net of deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducement costs and tax, would already be reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity.
For a more detailed discussion of the risks relating to changes in investment values and levels of investment impairment, and the potential causes of such changes, see Note5 of the consolidated financial statements and the Investments, Market Risk, Enterprise Risk Management and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A.
Derivative Instrument Hedge Effectiveness In the normal course of business, we primarily use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risk and in conjunction with asset/liability management, particularly in the Allstate Financial segment. The fair value of exchange traded derivative contracts is based on independent market quotations, whereas the fair value of non-exchange traded derivative contracts is based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models which use independent third party data as inputs or independent third party pricing sources.
When derivatives meet specific criteria, they may be designated as accounting hedges and accounted for as fair value, cash flow, foreign currency fair value, or foreign currency cash flow hedges. When designating a derivative as an accounting hedge, we formally document the hedging relationship, risk management objective and strategy. The documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and the assumptions used to assess how effective the hedging instrument is in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value attributable to the hedged risk. In the case of a cash flow hedge, this documentation includes the exposure to changes 25 in the hedged transaction's variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. We do not exclude any component of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument from the effectiveness assessment. At each reporting date, we confirm that the hedging instrument continues to be highly effective in offsetting the hedged risk. The determination of whether a hedging instrument is effective both at its inception and on an on-going basis requires a significant degree of judgment. For further discussion of these policies and quantification of the impact of these estimates and assumptions, see Note6 of the consolidated financial statements and the Investments, Market Risk, Enterprise Risk Management and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A.
Deferred Policy Acquisition Cost ("DAC") Amortization We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring business. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business are deferred and recorded as an asset on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
DAC related to property-liability contracts is amortized to income as premiums are earned, generally over periods of six to twelve months. The amortization methodology for DAC for Allstate Financial policies and contracts includes significant assumptions and estimates.
DAC related to traditional life insurance is amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the estimated revenues on such business. Assumptions relating to estimated premiums, investment income and realized capital gains and losses, as well as to all other aspects of DAC are determined based upon conditions as of the date of policy issuance and are generally not revised during the life of the policy. Any deviations from projected business in force, resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected levels, and any estimated premium deficiencies, change the rate of amortization in the period such events occur.
DAC related to interest-sensitive life, variable annuities and investment contracts is amortized in proportion to the incidence of the present value of estimated gross profits ("EGP") over the estimated lives of the contracts. Generally, the amortization period ranges from 15-30years. However, an assumption for the rate of contract surrenders is also used, which results in the majority of the DAC being amortized over the surrender charge period. EGP consists of estimates of the following components: benefit margins primarily from mortality, including guaranteed minimum death, income and accumulation benefits; investment margin including realized capital gains and losses; and contract administration, surrender and other contract charges, less maintenance expenses.
For variable annuity and life contracts, the most significant assumptions involved in determining EGP are the expected separate accounts fund performance after fees, surrender rates, lapse rates, and investment and mortality margins. Our long-term assumption of separate accounts fund performance net of fees is approximately 8%. Whenever actual separate accounts fund performance, based on the two most recent years, varies from 8%, we project performance levels over the next five years such that the mean return over that seven-year period equals the long-term 8% assumption. This process is referred to as "reversion to the mean" and is commonly used by the life insurance industry. Although the use of a reversion to the mean assumption is common within the industry, the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary between companies. For example, when applying this assumption we do not allow the mean future rates of return after fees projected over the five-year period to exceed 12.75% or fall below 0%. Revisions to EGPs result in changes in the cumulative amounts expensed as a component of amortization of DAC in the period in which the revision is made. This is commonly known as "DAC unlocking".
26 For quantification of the impact of these estimates and assumptions on Allstate Financial, see the Allstate Financial Segment and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A and Note2 of the consolidated financial statements.
Reserve for Property-Liability Insurance Claims and Claims Expense Estimation The Property-Liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of the reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense. These reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including claims that have been incurred but not reported ("IBNR"), as of the reporting date.
Allstate Protection reserve estimates are based on known facts and interpretations of circumstances, internal factors including our experience with similar cases, historical trends involving claim payment patterns, loss payments, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs and product mix. In addition, the reserve estimates are influenced by external factors including law changes, court decisions, changes to regulatory requirements, economic conditions, and public attitudes. In the normal course of business, we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters, appraisers, engineers, inspectors, other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non-catastrophe related claims. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process.
Because reserves are estimates of losses that have occurred, including IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The highest degree of uncertainty in estimating incurred losses is associated with reserves for the current accident year because the current accident year contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled, and that must be estimated as of the current reporting date. That proportion diminishes in subsequent years.
The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts, which are based on our best estimates. We regularly update our reserve estimates as new information becomes available and as events unfold that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims. Changes in prior year reserve estimates, which may be material, are reported in property-liability insurance claims and claims expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period such changes are determinable.
We believe our net loss reserves are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws and regulations. We calculate and record a single best reserve estimate, in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards, for each line of insurance, its components (coverages and perils), and state, for reported losses and for IBNR losses. The aggregation of these estimates forms the reserve liability recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Based on our products and coverages, historical experience, and stochastic modeling of actuarial chain ladder methodologies used to develop reserve estimates, we estimate that the potential variability of our Allstate Protection reserves, within a reasonable probability of other possible outcomes, may be plus or minus 4.3%, or plus or minus $400million in net income. Although this evaluation reflects the most likely outcomes, it is possible the final outcome may fall below or above these amounts.
Establishing Discontinued Lines and Coverages net loss reserves for asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than those presented by other types of claims. Among the complications are lack of historical data, long reporting delays, uncertainties as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure, unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage, unresolved legal issues regarding the determination, availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits, evolving and expanding theories of liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, the availability and collectibility of recoveries from reinsurance, retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements, estimations of the extent and timing of any contractual 27 liability, and other uncertainties. There are complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered, or were ever intended to be covered, and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage; what types of losses are covered; whether there is an insurer obligation to defend; how policy limits are determined; how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted; and whether clean-up costs represent insured property damage. We believe these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future, and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in material changes in loss reserves.
Management believes its net loss reserves for environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws and regulation. Due to the uncertainties and factors described above, management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be required.
For further discussion of these policies and quantification of the impact of reserve estimates, reserve reestimates and assumptions, see Notes 7 and 13 of the consolidated financial statements and the Catastrophe Losses, Property-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A.
Reserve for Life-Contingent Contract Benefits Estimation Long-term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields, mortality, morbidity, policy terminations and expenses are used when establishing the reserve for life-contingent contract benefits. These assumptions, which for traditional life insurance are applied using the net level premium method, include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by such characteristics as type of coverage, year of issue and policy duration. Future investment yield assumptions are determined at the time the policy is issued based upon prevailing investment yields as well as estimated reinvestment yields. Mortality, morbidity and policy termination assumptions are based on our experience and industry experience prevailing at the time the policies are issued. Expense assumptions include the estimated effects of inflation and expenses to be incurred beyond the premium-paying period.
For further discussion of these policies see Note8 of the consolidated financial statements and the Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors section of the MD&A.
PROPERTY-LIABILITY 2004 HIGHLIGHTS  Premiums written, an operating measure that is defined and reconciled to premiums earned on page32, reached a record $26.53billion during 2004. Compared to last year, premiums written increased 5.3% due to increases in the number of policies in force ("PIF") for the Allstate brand standard auto of 5.5% and homeowners of 6.4% and higher average premiums. Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners new business premiums increased 19.6% and 19.8%, respectively compared to December31, 2003.
Underwriting income for Property-Liability was $1.83billion in 2004 compared to $1.33billion in 2003, with a combined ratio improvement of 1.6 points to 93.0. These improvements were the result of higher premiums earned, favorable claim frequencies excluding catastrophes, and favorable Allstate Protection reserve reestimates partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and increased severity of current year claims.
Catastrophe losses in 2004 totaled $2.47billion compared to $1.49billion in 2003. The effect of catastrophe losses on the loss ratio was 9.5 and 6.0 points in 2004 and 2003, respectively.
28  As a result of profit improvement actions, the Encompass brand combined ratio improved 8.2 points in 2004 to 93.7, while Encompass brand standard auto PIF declined 5.8% compared to December31, 2003.
PROPERTY-LIABILITY OPERATIONS Overview Our Property-Liability operations consist of two business segments: Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages. Allstate Protection is comprised of two brands, the Allstate brand and Encompass brand. The Encompass brand name replaced the name Ivantage beginning in the third quarter of 2004. Allstate Protection is principally engaged in the sale of personal property and casualty insurance, primarily private passenger auto and homeowners insurance, to individuals in the United States and Canada. Discontinued Lines and Coverages includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run-off. These segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources.
Underwriting income (loss), a measure that is not based on GAAP and is reconciled to net income on page30, is calculated as premiums earned, less claims and claims expense ("losses"), amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges, as determined using GAAP. We use this measure in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of the Property-Liability insurance operations separately from investment results. It is also an integral component of incentive compensation. It is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance. Underwriting income (loss) should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of the business. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
The table below includes GAAP operating ratios we use to measure our profitability. We believe that they enhance an investor's understanding of our profitability. They are calculated as follows:  Claims and claims expense ("loss") ratiothe ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned. Loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses.
Expense ratiothe ratio of amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned.
Combined ratiothe ratio of claims and claims expense, amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. The difference between 100% and the combined ratio represents underwriting income as a percentage of premiums earned.
Effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on combined ratiothe ratio of claims and claims expense and other costs and expenses in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment to Property-Liability premiums earned. The sum of the effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on the combined ratio and the Allstate Protection combined ratio on page40 is equal to the Property-Liability combined ratio.
We have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the GAAP operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between fiscal periods.
Effect of catastrophe losses on loss ratiothe percentage of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expenses to premiums earned.
29  Effect of restructuring and related charges on expense ratiothe percentage of restructuring and related charges to premiums earned.
Summarized financial data, a reconciliation of underwriting income to net income and GAAP operating ratios for our Property-Liability operations for the years ended December31, are presented in the following table.

We are seeking, through the utilization of our distribution channels, Tiered Pricing and consumer marketing, to attract and retain high lifetime value customers who will potentially provide favorable prospects for profitability over the course of their relationship with us. We continue to enhance technology to integrate our distribution channels, improve customer service, facilitate the introduction of new products and services and reduce infrastructure costs related to supporting agencies and handling claims. We have aligned agency and management compensation and the overall strategies of the Allstate brand to best serve our customers by basing certain incentives on Allstate brand profitability and growth and sales of Allstate Financial products. Beginning in 2003, we implemented and maintained a broader marketing approach throughout the U.S. These actions and others are designed to optimize the effectiveness of our distribution and service channels by increasing the productivity of the Allstate brand's exclusive agencies and The Good Hands Network.
The Encompass brand business sells private passenger auto and homeowners insurance to individuals through independent agencies. Encompass brand includes standard auto and homeowners products with the Encompass SM brand name and non-standard auto products with the Deerbrook brand name. Our strategy for the Encompass brand focuses on growing profitably, and growing in select markets, in part by using Tiered Pricing. The integration of Encompass policies onto Allstate systems has resulted in a different counting process for PIF. As a result, percent changes in PIF and average premium and the renewal ratio are subject to some distortion until the integration has been in place for a full year.
Our sophisticated process for segmenting a market ("Tiered Pricing"), and underwriting are designed to enhance both our competitive position and profit potential, and produce a broader range of premiums that is more refined than the range generated by the standard/non-standard model. Tiered Pricing includes our Strategic Risk Management ("SRM") program which considers, to the extent legally permissible, insurance scoring based on information that is obtained from credit reports as well as a number of other risk evaluation factors. At the same time, we continue to expand the number of tiers with successive rating program releases, resulting in a diminishing capacity to draw meaningful comparisons to historical presentations.
Our rating plans for private passenger auto insurance are no longer consistently segregated into standard plans and non-standard plans. In some states, we have implemented Tiered Pricing and modified our underwriting criteria in a way that allows us to write what may be considered both standard and non-standard business with one tiered-rating plan, which may also be considered a standard rating plan designed to accommodate non-standard risks. As we continue to use Tiered Pricing and underwriting, the distinctions between standard and non-standard will become less important in certain states. For this reason we are shifting our managerial focus to auto, which is the sum of standard auto and non-standard auto. We also believe it is useful for investors to analyze auto results that aggregate our standard and non-standard business. However, we will continue to provide results for standard and non-standard auto. Generally, standard auto customers are expected to have lower risks of loss than non-standard auto customers.
Substantially all of new and approximately 65% of renewal business written for Allstate brand auto uses Tiered Pricing. For Allstate brand homeowners, approximately 65% of new and 35% of renewal business written uses Tiered Pricing. For Allstate brand auto and homeowners business written under Tiered Pricing, our results indicate an increase in retention and a shift toward more customers who we consider high lifetime value and who generate more favorable loss results.
31 Another element of our strategy for our homeowners insurance business is to target customers whose risk of loss provides the best opportunity for profitable growth, including managing exposure on policies in areas where the potential loss from catastrophes exceeds acceptable levels. This includes a continual reevaluation of our countrywide catastrophe risk management strategies for hurricanes and earthquakes. Homeowners product pricing is typically intended to establish returns that we deem acceptable over a long-term period. Losses, including losses from catastrophic events and weather-related losses (such as wind, hail, lightning, freeze and water losses not meeting our criteria to be declared a catastrophe), are accrued on an occurrence basis within the policy period. Therefore, in any reporting period, loss experience from catastrophic events and weather-related losses may contribute to negative or positive underwriting performance relative to the expectations we incorporated into the products' pricing. Accordingly, homeowners products are more capital intensive than other personal lines products.
Allstate Protection's goal is to achieve pricing targets comprising a competitive combined ratio and return on equity. Our primary strategies to achieve this goal include continuing our efforts to seek approval for rate changes for all Allstate Protection products in all jurisdictions where we believe such changes are needed and can be obtained based on rate indicators, such as our projected claim frequency and severity experience and expense levels, and to pursue other actions affecting our profitability such as improving our underwriting and claims processes.
Premiums written, an operating measure, is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period. Premiums earned is a GAAP measure. Premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro-rata basis over the policy period. The portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Since the Allstate brand policy periods are typically 6months for auto and 12months for homeowners, Encompass auto and homeowners policy periods are typically 12months and Deerbrook auto policy periods are typically 6months, rate changes taken during 2004 and 2003 will generally be recognized in premiums earned over a period of 6 to 24months. During this period, premiums written at a higher rate will cause an increase in the balance of unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
32 The following table shows the unearned premium balance at December31 and the timeframe in which we expect to recognize these premiums as earned.

The increase in Allstate brand standard auto PIF in 2004 when compared to 2003 is primarily the result of increases in new business due to the implementation of a broader marketing approach in most of the U.S. and an increased renewal ratio, which management believes is related to reduced rate activity and improved customer loyalty. Although growth in new business remains above prior year, this trend leveled off during 2004. Sequential growth of Allstate brand standard auto PIF for the last four quarters has averaged 1.4% each quarter. New business comparisons also reflect the July2003 implementation of our new rating plan in the California market. The increase in the Allstate brand standard auto average premium in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily due to higher average renewal premiums. The rate of increase in average premium has declined in 2004 due to the decrease in rate activity. The reduced level of rate changes in the current year are due to declines in frequency and severity as discussed in the Underwriting Results section. The increase in the Allstate brand standard auto average premium in 2003 34 when compared to 2002 is primarily due to higher average renewal premiums. Higher average renewal premiums resulted from rate actions taken in the last three years and, to a lesser degree, a normal shift by policyholders to newer and more expensive autos. The increases in new business premiums, PIF and the renewal ratio in 2003 compared to 2002 are due to an improved loss ratio driving more modest need for rate increases and to the implementation of a broader marketing approach in most of the U.S.
Encompass brand standard auto new business premiums written increased in 2004 when compared to 2003 and renewal business premiums written decreased in 2004 when compared to 2003 primarily due to increases in new PIF and rate activity, the effect of which is declining due to the decrease in rate change activity. Encompass brand standard auto premiums written increased in 2003 when compared to 2002 primarily due to profit improvement actions resulting in increased average premium per policy, partially offset by fewer PIF. Increased average premiums per policy were related to rate actions taken during the last three years. We expect the rate of decline in Encompass brand standard auto PIF to moderate. Our improved profitability has positioned us to pursue growth opportunities in this channel.

Declines in Allstate brand non-standard auto renewal business premiums during 2004 and 2003 were due to a decline in PIF. Renewal PIF declined because new business production was insufficient to make up for an inherently low renewal ratio in this business, and new business PIF declined due to continued agent focus on our standard auto business. In 2004, the increase in average premium declined due to the decrease in rate activity.
35 Encompass brand (Deerbrook) non-standard premiums written have decreased slightly in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to declines in new business. Deerbrook non-standard renewal business premiums increased in 2003 due to the re-entry of Deerbrook in the non-standard market during 2002.

The Allstate brand homeowners PIF increase in 2004 compared to 2003 is the result of the increases in new business due to a broader marketing approach in most of the U.S. and an increased renewal ratio, which management believes is related to reduced rate activity and increased customer loyalty. Due to recent hurricanes, beginning in September2004, we have curtailed our acceptance of new business in Florida, which will continue to adversely impact our growth in new business premiums. Sequential growth of Allstate brand homeowners PIF for the last four quarters has averaged 1.6% each quarter. The increases in average premium during 2004 and 2003 were primarily due to higher average renewal premiums in both years. Higher average renewal premiums were related to increasing home values, along with rate actions taken in the current and prior year. The reduced level of rate changes in the current year are due to declines in frequency and severity as discussed in the Underwriting Results section. The Allstate brand homeowners PIF increase in 2003 compared to 2002 was the result of the increased competitiveness of our underwriting practices, products and rates in the homeowners market.
Encompass brand homeowners new business premiums written increased in 2004 compared to 2003 due to increases in PIF and average premium. Increases in Encompass brand homeowners average premium were due to rate actions taken during the current and prior year.

The increase in underwriting income was the result of increased premiums earned, declines in auto and homeowners claim frequency (rate of claim occurrence) excluding catastrophes and favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses, increased operating costs and expenses and increased current year claim severity (average cost per claim). For further discussion and quantification of the impact of reserve estimates, reserve reestimates and assumptions, see the Property-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A.
Claims and claims expense during 2004 includes estimated catastrophe losses of $2.00billion, net of recoveries from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund ("FHCF"), related to hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. This estimate includes net losses on personal lines auto and property policies and net losses on commercial policies. For a further discussion of catastrophe losses, see page42.
Allstate Protection generated underwriting income of $1.90billion during 2003 compared to $497million in 2002. The increase in underwriting income was the result of increased premiums earned, declines in auto and homeowners claim frequency and favorable prior year reserve reestimates, partially offset by increased catastrophe losses, increased operating costs and expenses and increased current year claim severity.
38 Changes in auto current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the medical and auto repair sectors of the economy. We mitigate these effects through various loss management programs. Injury claims are affected largely by medical cost inflation while physical damage claims are affected largely by auto repair cost inflation and used car prices. Our rate of increase in incurred injury claim severity during 2004 and 2003 was lower than the relevant medical cost indices. We believe our claim settlement initiatives, such as improvements to the claim settlement process, medical management programs, the use of special investigative units to detect fraud and handle suspect claims, litigation management and defense strategies, as well as various loss management initiatives underway, contribute positively to the mitigation of injury severity trends. However, auto injury claim severity could offset the success of these programs; therefore, we will continue to pursue claim mitigation programs.
For auto physical damage coverages, we monitor our rate of increase in average cost per claim against a weighted average of the Body Work price index and the Used Car price index. In 2004, our rate of increase in incurred physical damage current year claim severity was generally lower than the weighted index. In 2003, our rate of increase in incurred physical damage current year claim severity was generally higher than the weighted index. We believe that results were favorably impacted by the application of enhanced claim settlement practices for auto physical damage claims. Accordingly, we continue to pursue various loss management initiatives that we expect to contribute positively to the mitigation of physical damage severity trends. However, during 2003 the increase in auto physical damage claim severity more than offset the success of these programs.
Changes in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials, the cost of construction and property repair services, the cost of replacing home furnishings and other contents, the types of claims that qualify for coverage, deductibles and other economic and environmental factors. In 2004 and 2003, we experienced an increase in homeowners severity compared to prior year. We employ various loss management programs to mitigate the effect of these factors; however, homeowners severity may increase, offsetting the success of these programs. We have also taken numerous actions that we expect to contribute to profitable trends in the homeowners loss ratio.

These declines were due to higher premiums earned, favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years and lower claim frequency, partially offset by higher current year claim severity. Standard auto claim frequency in the fourth quarter of 2004 increased slightly over the prior year quarter due to weather related events in the last two weeks of 2004; however, our underlying frequency trends remain favorable. In 2003, the Allstate brand standard auto loss ratio declined 4.8 points and the Encompass brand standard auto loss ratio declined 9.7 points when compared to 2002. The declines in 2003 were due to higher premiums earned, lower claim frequency and favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and claim severity.
Non-standard auto loss ratio declined 11.7 points for the Allstate brand and 8.9 points for Encompass brand in 2004 when compared to 2003. These declines were due to favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years and lower claim frequency, partially offset by higher current year claim severity. In 2003, the Allstate brand non-standard loss ratio declined 6.8 points and the Encompass brand non-standard loss ratio declined 24.3 points. These declines were due to lower claim frequency, favorable reserve 40 reestimates and higher premiums earned in Encompass brand, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and higher claim severities.
Auto loss ratio declined 6.3 points for the Allstate brand and 8.1 points for the Encompass brand in 2004 when compared to 2003. These declines were due to favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years, lower claim frequency and higher premiums earned for Allstate brand, partially offset by higher current year claim severity. In 2003, the Allstate brand auto loss ratio declined 5.0 points and the Encompass brand auto loss ratio declined 9.9 points when compared to 2002. These declines were due to higher premiums earned and lower claim frequency and favorable reserve reestimates, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and claim severity.
Homeowners loss ratio increased 4.2 points for the Allstate brand and declined 13.0 points for the Encompass brand in 2004 when compared to 2003. These fluctuations were due to higher catastrophes partially offset by higher premiums earned, favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years and lower claim frequency, excluding catastrophes for the Allstate brand, and higher current year claim severity. In 2003, the Allstate brand loss ratio declined 12.6 points and the Encompass brand loss ratio increased 1.6 points when compared to 2002. These fluctuations were due to higher premiums earned, lower claim frequency and favorable reserve reestimates for the Allstate brand, including lower than anticipated losses in Texas related to mold claims, offset by increased catastrophe losses, higher claim severity and higher reserve reestimates for Encompass brand. Allstate brand incurred losses related to mold claims in Texas were negligible in 2003 compared to losses of $326million in 2002.
For homeowners, we implemented programs such as market or state-specific product designs, rate increases, underwriting and rating changes, discontinuation of specific coverages, specific policy language clarifying coverage for mold claims and loss management initiatives to improve the profitability of this business. Because of the success of these programs we returned this business to profitability in 2003, although volatility in underwriting results during 2004 was caused by catastrophes.
Expense ratio for Allstate Protection increased in 2004 compared to 2003 due to higher amortization of DAC resulting from higher agent incentives and increases in marketing expense. Higher agent incentives were based on higher underlying profitability and increases in premium written. Expense ratio for Allstate Protection increased in 2003 compared to 2002 due to higher agent incentives, marketing expenditures, charitable contributions and employee-related expenses.
The impact of specific costs and expenses on the expense ratio is included in the following table.
Allstate brand Encompass brand 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 Amortization of DAC 14.5 13.9 13.3 19.6 19.1 19.8 Other costs and expenses 9.2 9.3 8.7 9.0 9.9 12.6 Restructuring and related charges 0.2 0.3 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.1 Total expense ratio 23.9 23.5 22.5 29.0 29.3 32.5 The expense ratio for the standard auto and homeowners businesses generally approximate the total Allstate Protection expense ratio of 24.3 in 2004, 23.9 in 2003 and 23.3 in 2002. The expense ratio for the non-standard auto business generally is lower than the total Allstate Protection expense ratio due to lower agent commission rates and higher average premiums for non-standard auto as compared to standard auto. The Encompass brand expense ratio is higher on average than the expense ratio of the Allstate brand due to higher commission rates and licensing fees paid to CNA Financial Corporation.
41 Allstate Protection underwriting income was impacted by restructuring charges. For a more detailed discussion of these charges, see Note12 of the consolidated financial statements. Net income was also favorably impacted in 2003 by adjustments for prior year tax liabilities totaling $69million.
DAC We establish a DAC asset for costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business, principally agents' remuneration, premium taxes, certain underwriting and direct mail solicitation expenses. For the Allstate Protection business, DAC is amortized to income consistent with the timeframes in which premiums are earned.
The balance of DAC for each product type at December31, is included in the following table.

We define a "catastrophe" as an event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of $1million and involves multiple first party policyholders, or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset, per-event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event. Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including earthquakes, volcanoes, wildfires, tornadoes, hailstorms, hurricanes, tropical storms, high winds and winter storms. We are also exposed to human-made catastrophic events, such as certain acts of terrorism or industrial accidents. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted.
Over time we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high levels of natural catastrophes. Actions we have taken to limit our exposure include purchase of reinsurance in certain states; restricting the amount and location of new business; limiting the availability of certain policy coverages; placing policies with third parties; and increasing our participation in catastrophe pools. However, the impact of these actions may be diminished by the growth in insured values, the effect of state insurance laws and regulations and by the effect of competitive considerations. We have also requested and received rate increases and have expanded the use of hurricane, tropical cyclone and earthquake deductibles in certain regions that are subject to high levels of catastrophes.
We consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes to be major metropolitan centers near the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States, and the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to earthquakes to be California, areas surrounding the New Madrid fault system in the Midwest and faults in and surrounding Seattle, Washington and Charleston, South Carolina. For further disclosure of our participation in the FHCF, Citizens Property Insurance Corporation and the California Earthquake Authority ("CEA"), which limit our exposure to catastrophes in certain areas, see Notes 9 and 13 of the consolidated financial statements.
42 We include catastrophe losses in property-liability claims and claims expense. As a result, catastrophe losses affect both our underwriting results and loss ratios. During 2004, catastrophe losses totaled $2.47billion, compared to catastrophe losses of $1.49billion in 2003 and $731million in 2002. Of the $2.47billion of catastrophe losses incurred during 2004, $2.00billion related to hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, which struck portions of Florida, the southeastern seaboard, and other parts of the United States.
Estimates of losses from hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne at December31, 2004 are shown in the table below: (in millions) Personal Lines Gross Losses FHCF Recoveries Net Losses Charley (August13) $ 756 ($ 323 ) $ 433 Frances (September3) 650 (235 ) 415 Ivan (September14) 576 (47 ) 529 Jeanne (September25) 330  330 Subtotal $ 2,312 ($ 605 ) 1,707 Commercial 393 (98 ) 295 Total Loss Estimate $ 2,705 $ (703 ) $ 2,002 Since our preliminary provision for losses of $1.64billion, net of recoveries from the FHCF, as of September30, 2004, we revised our provision for these four hurricane losses to $2.00billion, net of recoveries from the FHCF, as of December31, 2004. Estimates of losses for these storms were increased due to increased estimates of claim severity on personal lines and commercial property claims in Florida. When the initial estimates for these storms were prepared in the third quarter, these storms had only recently occurred, very few losses had been paid, and due to the extensive devastation and massive scale of these storms, it was not possible to gain access to and physically inspect a sufficiently large portion of claims. During the fourth quarter, property inspections were completed by claim adjusters and, consequently, we were able to develop more accurate assessments of the actual cost of physical damages. A significant amount of these losses have been paid.
Estimates of gross qualifying personal property losses for Charley, Frances and Ivan have exceeded the $312million per occurrence FHCF retention, thus permitting reimbursement of 90% of qualifying losses above the retention. For Jeanne, estimated qualifying property losses are $279million, which is below the FHCF retention. Estimates of qualifying commercial habitational property losses for Charley and Frances have exceeded the $30million per occurrence FHCF retention. For Ivan and Jeanne, estimated qualifying commercial habitational property losses are $27million and $14million, respectively, which are below the FHCF retention. For all of the storms, any adverse development of losses not qualifying for FHCF reimbursement will adversely impact net income if and when determined.
The current estimates of losses for these storms have a much greater degree of certainty than previous estimates, which were prepared shortly after these storms occurred. However, there are still factors and complications that may cause future development of these estimates to be either favorable or unfavorable. Among other things, there are still claims to be reported; we are still evaluating the impact in communities that were hit by more than one hurricane; and our evaluation of losses is complicated by the fact that property damage resulted from both flooding, which Allstate policies do not cover, and high winds, which Allstate policies typically do cover. In addition, because of increased demand for services and supplies in the areas affected by the hurricanes and the length of time required to repair the 43 damage, our loss estimates may not accurately reflect inflated costs of repair. Finally, the net loss estimates could be affected by the amount of FHCF reimbursements actually received.
Historical Catastrophe Experience In the last 13years, the average annual impact of catastrophes on our Property-Liability loss ratio was 6.5 pts. However, this average does not reflect the impact of some of the more significant actions we have taken to limit our catastrophe exposure. Consequently, we think it is useful to consider the impact of catastrophes after excluding losses that are now substantially covered by the CEA, FHCF or placed with a third party. The average annual impact of all catastrophes, excluding losses from Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki and losses from California earthquakes, on our Property-Liability loss ratio was 4.4 during the last 13years. Comparatively, the average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio over the last 12years, excluding losses from Hurricane Andrew, California earthquakes and Hawaii hurricanes during that period was 16.3 points, with an impact of 16.2 in areas bordering the eastern and gulf coasts with hurricane exposure and an impact of 16.5 in all other areas.
Allstate Protection Outlook  We expect to see continued growth of Allstate brand auto premiums written due to increased PIF resulting from increases in the number and productivity of agents representing us, increased advertising effectiveness and higher customer loyalty partially offset by consistent average gross premiums.
We will continue to review our homeowners business in order to determine its potential for future profitability. Our review may result in actions designed to limit our catastrophe risk such as increased purchases of reinsurance, increased rates or limitations on new business writings.
As a result of the four hurricanes in Florida and their very adverse financial impacts and in an effort to mitigate our exposure to catastrophe risk, we are currently evaluating various actions that could negatively impact the level of homeowners premiums written and profitability. The actions under consideration include continued suspension of writing new business, purchasing additional reinsurance and other actions to reduce exposure to hurricanes, including placing policies with third parties, increasing rates, and advancing proposals for legislative reform. Additionally, the state of Florida has taken other actions that could negatively impact our level of homeowners premiums written and profitability, including changing to seasonal hurricane deductibles, discouraging insurance companies from increasing rates and not allowing non-renewal of policies.
We expect to experience premium growth in the Encompass brand during 2005 since we have attained profitability in this business.
We expect that volatility in the level of catastrophes or claim frequency we experience will contribute to variation in our underwriting results.
We will continue to examine our expenses for additional areas where costs may be reduced. Any reductions in costs we achieve, however, may be offset by the costs of other new initiatives, such as increased expenditures for technology. We expect advertising expenses in 2005 to be comparable to 2004 expenses, which were approximately $275million, but will be more focused on our target customers. In addition, other factors may increase our expenses, including an adverse market impact on net periodic pension cost, increases in other benefit expenses and guaranty fund assessments.
44 DISCONTINUED LINES AND COVERAGES SEGMENT Overview The Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run-off. We have assigned management of this segment to a designated group of professionals with expertise in claims handling, policy coverage interpretation and exposure identification. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises in this segment.
Summarized underwriting results for the years ended December31, are presented in the following table.
(in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Premiums written $ 4 $ 12 $ 7 Premiums earned $ 6 $ 13 $ 10 Claims and claims expense (635 ) (574 ) (233 ) Other costs and expenses (9 ) (10 ) (11 ) Underwriting loss $ (638 ) $ (571 ) $ (234 ) During 2004, the underwriting loss was primarily due to reestimates of asbestos reserves totaling $463million, and an increase of $136million in the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance. The cost of administering claims settlements totaled $22million, $23million and $39million for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
During 2003, the underwriting loss was also primarily due to our annual review of reserves for asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines exposures, resulting in an increase in reserves totaling $514million, including increases for asbestos of $442million, $34million due to new information received for two manufacturing insureds in bankruptcy, and $38million for an excess insurance policyholder who submitted new and unanticipated claims that were for previously not designated, and therefore unexpected, coverage years.
See the Property-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves for a more detailed discussion.
Discontinued Lines and Coverages Outlook  We may continue to experience asbestos losses in the future. These losses could be due to the potential adverse impact of new information relating to new and additional claims or the impact of resolving unsettled claims based on unanticipated events such as litigation or legislative, judicial and regulatory actions. Because of our annual "ground up" review, we believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on available information, technology, laws and regulations.
PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTMENT RESULTS Net investment income increased 5.7% in 2004 when compared to last year, after increasing 1.3% in 2003 when compared to 2002. These increases were due to higher portfolio balances resulting from positive cash flows from operations and investment activities and higher income from partnerships, partially offset by lower portfolio yields.
45 The following table presents the average pre-tax investment yields (1) for the year ended December31.
2004 2003 2002 Fixed income securities: tax-exempt 5.4 % 5.5 % 5.6 % Fixed income securities: tax-exempt equivalent 7.9 7.8 8.0 Fixed income securities: taxable 5.2 5.5 6.5 Equity securities 4.6 4.4 3.9 Mortgage loans 5.5 7.7 5.8 Total portfolio 5.1 5.3 5.6 (1) Pre-tax yield is calculated as annualized investment income (including dividend income in the case of equity securities) divided by the average of the beginning and end of period investment balances. Amortized cost basis is used to calculate the average investment balance for fixed income securities and mortgage loans. Cost is used for equity securities.
Net realized capital gains and losses, after-tax were $397million in 2004 compared to $192million in 2003 and $(314)million in 2002. The following table presents the factors driving the net realized capital gains and losses results.

Investment Outlook  The Property-Liability investment portfolio relies upon positive cash flows to support investment purchases. Cash flows available for investment can be impacted by volatility in underwriting results and the level of dividends paid by Allstate Insurance Company ("AIC") to The Allstate Corporation. The amount of cash flow available to invest directly impacts the amount of Property-Liability net investment income.
Allstate expects to experience lower investment yields due, in part, to the reinvestment of proceeds from security prepayments, calls and maturities, and the investment of cash flows from operations in securities yielding less than the average portfolio rate.
PROPERTY-LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS EXPENSE RESERVES Underwriting results of Property-Liability are significantly influenced by estimates of property-liability claims and claims expense reserves. We describe our reserve process in the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A and Note7 of the consolidated financial statements. These reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including IBNR claims, as of the reporting date.
46 Reserves are established for claims as they occur for each line of business based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle the claims. The actual loss results are compared to prior estimates and differences are recorded as reserve reestimates. The primary actuarial technique used to estimate reserves and provide for losses is a "chain ladder" estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses (paid losses plus individual case reserves set by claim adjusters) for an accident year or a report year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time. An accident year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims occurred. A report year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims are reported. Both classifications are used to prepare estimates of required reserves for payments to be made in the future.
In the chain ladder estimation technique, a ratio (development factor) is calculated which compares current results to results in the prior period for each accident year. A three-year or two-year average development factor, based on historical results, is usually multiplied by the current experience to estimate the development of losses of each accident year from the current time period into the next time period. The development factors for the next time periods for each accident year are compounded over the remaining calendar years to calculate an estimate of ultimate losses for each accident year. Occasionally, unusual aberrations in loss patterns are caused by factors such as changes in claim reporting, settlement patterns, unusually large losses, process changes, legal or regulatory changes, and other influences. In these instances, analyses of alternate development factor selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors, and actuarial judgment is applied to make appropriate development factor assumptions needed to develop a best estimate of ultimate losses. Paid losses are then subtracted from estimated ultimate losses to determine the indicated reserves. The difference between indicated reserves and recorded reserves is the amount of reserve reestimate.
Reserves are reestimated quarterly. When new development factors are calculated from actual losses, and they differ from estimated development factors used in previous reserve estimates, assumptions about losses and required reserves are revised based on the new development factors. Changes to reserves are recorded in the period in which development factor changes result in reserve reestimates.
Over one thousand actuarial estimates of the types described above are prepared each quarter to monitor losses for each line of insurance, major components of losses (such as coverages and perils), major states or groups of states and for reported losses and IBNR. Often, several different estimates are prepared for each detailed component, incorporating alternative analyses of changing claim settlement patterns and other influences on losses, from which we select our best estimate for each component, occasionally incorporating additional analyses and actuarial judgment, as described above. These estimates also incorporate the historical impact of inflation into reserve estimates, the implicit assumption being that a multi-year average development factor represents an adequate provision. Based on our review of these estimates, our best estimate of required reserves for each state/line/coverage component is recorded for each accident year, and the required reserves for each component are summed to create the reserve balances carried on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
The facts and circumstances leading to our reestimate of reserves relate to revisions to the development factors used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid. Reestimates occur because actual losses are different than that predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates. At December31, 2004, the impact of a reserve reestimation resulting in a one percent increase in net reserves would be a decrease of approximately $110million in net income. A reserve reestimation resulting in a one percent decrease in net reserves would increase net income by approximately $110million. For a further description of our reserving policies and the potential variability in our reserve estimates, see the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A.
47 For Allstate Protection, at each reporting date the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates of losses arises from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding accident year. The greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because, at the end of the current accident year, the percentage of losses that have not been reported or settled and that consequently must be estimated, is higher than it will be as time elapses. Most of these losses relate to damaged property such as automobiles and to medical care for injuries from accidents. During the first year after the end of an accident year, a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled. When accident year losses paid through the end of the first year following the accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates, the trends inherent in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly. Consequently, this is the point in time at which we tend to make our largest reestimates of losses for an accident year. After the second year, the losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle, such as those involving serious injuries or litigation. Private passenger auto insurance provides a good illustration of the uncertainty of future loss estimates: our typical annual percentage payout of reserves (estimated losses) for an accident year is approximately 45% in the first year after the end of the accident year, 25% in the second year, 10% in the third year, 10% in the fourth year, and the remaining 10% thereafter.

Auto reserve reestimates in 2002 were primarily due to increasing severity trends for automobile repair and medical costs of $55million for Encompass brand operations and $17million for Canadian operations, partially offset by reduced reserve reestimates for the Allstate brand.
Homeowners reserve reestimates in 2004 were primarily due to late reported loss development that was better than expected. Homeowners reserve reestimates in 2003 were primarily due to severity development that was greater than expected and additional losses from the 1994 Northridge earthquake, partially offset by the release of reserves due to lower than anticipated losses in Texas related to mold claims.
Homeowners reserve reestimates in 2002 were primarily due to claim severity and late reported losses that were greater than the level anticipated in previous reserve estimates. This resulted in reserve reestimates including $78million related to IBNR, $95million related to claim severity and $169million related to mold claims in Texas. In addition, reserves were increased $25million for settlement of losses remaining from the 1994 Northridge earthquake. In March2002, a new Texas homeowner policy form was implemented that restricted mold coverage from what had been provided by a previous broad state-mandated policy form. As a result, coverage provided and the incidence of losses for mold diminished in the second half of the year. Reserve reestimates in 2003 and 2002 for the 1994 Northridge earthquake losses were to provide for higher than anticipated losses resulting from settlement of class action litigation and due to greater than expected additional losses and expenses caused by coverage afforded due to the passage of California's Senate Bill 1899 in 1999.
Other lines reserve reestimates in 2004, 2003, and 2002 were primarily the result of claim severity development different than anticipated in previous estimates.

This was primarily due to auto injury severity development that was better than expected and late reported loss development that was better than expected due to lower frequency trends in recent years.
The Allstate brand experienced $209million of favorable prior year reserve reestimates in 2003. This was primarily due to auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than expected and the release of reserves due to lower than anticipated losses in Texas related to mold claims.
The Allstate brand experienced $386million of unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates in 2002. This was primarily due to $338million of homeowners reestimates resulting from claim severity development and late reported losses that were greater than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates, including $169million related to mold claims in Texas and $25million for settlement of losses remaining from the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Reestimates of reserves from prior years for auto and other businesses were $48million for the year, of which $20million was for Canadian business reserves. These reestimates were primarily due to increasing inflationary pressures on auto severities and for some of the small non-auto products.
These trends are primarily responsible for revisions to loss development factors, as previously described, used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid. Because these trends cause actual losses to differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates, reserves are revised as actuarial studies validate new trends, based on the indications of updated development factor calculations.
51 The impact of these reestimates on the Allstate brand underwriting income (loss) is shown in the table below.

Reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined. Using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment, this detailed and comprehensive "ground up" methodology determines reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure (e.g. claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure) presented by individual policyholders.
Reserve reestimates for the Discontinued Lines and Coverages, as shown in the table below, were increased primarily for asbestos in 2004 and 2003, and for asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines losses in 2002.
2004 2003 2002 (in millions) Jan 1 Reserves Reserve Reestimate Jan 1 Reserves Reserve Reestimate Jan 1 Reserves Reserve Reestimate Asbestos Claims $ 1,079 $ 463 $ 635 $ 520 $ 675 $ 121 Environmental Claims 257  304 2 343 26 Other Discontinued Lines 501 172 491 52 476 84 Total Discontinued Lines and Coverages $ 1,837 $ 635 $ 1,430 $ 574 $ 1,494 $ 231 Underwriting (loss) income (638 ) (571 ) (234 ) Reserve reestimates as a % of underwriting (loss) income (99.5 )% (100.5 )% (98.7 )% Reserve additions for asbestos in 2004, totaling $463million, were primarily for products-related coverage. This increase essentially was a result of a continuing level of increased claim activity being reported by excess insurance policyholders with existing active claims, and reestimates of liabilities for increased assumed reinsurance cessions, as ceding companies (other insurance carriers) also experienced increased claim activity. Increased claim activity over prior estimates has also resulted in an 52 increased estimate for future claims reported. These trends are consistent with the trends of other carriers in the industry, which we believe are related to increased publicity and awareness of coverage, ongoing litigation, potential congressional activity and bankruptcy actions. During 2004, reserve reestimates, including an increase in the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables, included $150million for other discontinued lines exposures in run-off, and $22million related to the cost of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run-off exposures.
Reserve additions for asbestos in 2003, totaling $520million, were primarily for products-related coverage. This increase essentially was a result of more claimants being reported by excess insurance policyholders with existing active claims and new claims being reported in our assumed reinsurance business. This trend is consistent with the trends of other carriers in the industry. We believe it is related to increased publicity and awareness of coverage, ongoing litigation, potential congressional activity and bankruptcy actions. During 2003, reserve reestimates included $29million for other discontinued lines exposures in run-off, and $23million related to the cost of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run-off exposures.
In 2002, asbestos reserves were increased by $121million primarily due to final settlement of exposure to an insured and adverse reestimates on other estimated asbestos losses due to an increase in claims from smaller more peripheral exposures. Pending asbestos claims related to excess policies issued to manufacturers that have filed for bankruptcy protection also increased to a minor extent. Reserve reestimates also included $45million for other discontinued lines exposures in run-off and $39million related to the cost of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run-off exposures.
Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises principally from assumed reinsurance coverage written during the 1960s through the mid-1980s, including reinsurance on primary insurance written on large United States companies, and from direct excess insurance written from 1972 through 1985, including substantial excess general liability coverages on Fortune 500 companies. Additional exposure stems from direct primary commercial insurance written during the 1960s through the mid-1980s. Other discontinued lines exposures primarily relate to general liability and product liability mass tort claims, such as those for medical devices and other products.
In 1986, the general liability policy form used by us and others in the property-liability industry was amended to introduce an "absolute pollution exclusion," which excluded coverage for environmental damage claims, and to add an asbestos exclusion. Most general liability policies issued prior to 1987 contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage. General liability policies issued in 1987 and thereafter contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage and annual aggregate limits for all coverages. Our experience to date is that these policy form changes have limited the extent of our exposure to environmental and asbestos claim risks.
Our exposure to liability for asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines losses manifests differently depending on whether it arises from assumed reinsurance coverage, direct excess insurance, or direct primary commercial insurance. The direct insurance coverage we provided that covered asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines was substantially "excess" in nature.
Direct excess insurance and reinsurance involve coverage written by us for specific layers of protection above retentions and other insurance plans. The nature of excess coverage and reinsurance provided to other insurers limits our exposure to loss to specific layers of protection in excess of policyholder retention or primary insurance plans. Our exposure is further limited by the significant reinsurance that we have purchased on our excess business.
53 Our assumed reinsurance business involved writing generally small participations in other insurers' reinsurance programs. The reinsured losses in which we participate may be a proportion of all eligible losses or eligible losses in excess of defined retentions. The majority of our assumed reinsurance exposure, approximately 85%, is for excess of loss coverage, while the remaining 15% is for pro-rata coverage.
Our direct primary commercial insurance business did not include coverage to large asbestos manufacturers. This business comprises a cross section of policyholders engaged in many diverse business sectors located throughout the country.
The table below summarizes reserves and claim activity for asbestos and environmental claims before (Gross) and after (Net) the effects of reinsurance for the past three years.
2004 2003 2002 (in millions, except ratios) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Asbestos claims Beginning reserves $ 1,583 $ 1,079 $ 904 $ 635 $ 929 $ 675 Incurred claims and claims expense 971 463 800 520 180 121 Claims and claims expense paid (127 ) (78 ) (121 ) (76 ) (205 ) (161 ) Ending reserves $ 2,427 $ 1,464 $ 1,583 $ 1,079 $ 904 $ 635 Annual survival ratio 19.1 18.8 13.1 14.2 4.4 3.9 3-year survival ratio 16.1 13.9 11.1 10.9 5.3 5.1 Environmental claims Beginning reserves $ 315 $ 257 $ 393 $ 304 $ 444 $ 343 Incurred claims and claims expense 1   2 34 26 Claims and claims expense paid (35 ) (25 ) (78 ) (49 ) (85 ) (65 ) Ending reserves $ 281 $ 232 $ 315 $ 257 $ 393 $ 304 Annual survival ratio 8.1 9.1 4.0 5.2 4.6 4.7 3-year survival ratio 4.3 5.0 4.3 5.0 5.4 5.1 Combined environmental and asbestos claims Annual survival ratio 16.7 16.4 9.5 10.7 4.5 4.2 3-year survival ratio 12.5 11.2 8.8 8.9 5.3 5.1 Percentage of IBNR in ending reserves 61.6 % 59.9 % 53.5 % The survival ratio is calculated by taking our ending reserves divided by payments made during the year. This is a commonly used but extremely simplistic and imprecise approach to measuring the adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserve levels. Many factors, such as mix of business, level of coverage provided and settlement procedures have significant impacts on the amount of environmental and asbestos claims and claims expense reserves, claim payments and the resultant ratio. As payments result in corresponding reserve reductions, survival ratios can be expected to vary over time.
In 2004 and 2003, the asbestos survival ratios improved due to higher reserve balances and relatively low payments. In 2004, the environmental survival ratios improved due to lower claim payments paid, while in 2003 the ratios declined slightly due to a lower reserve balance.
54 The total commutations, policy buy-backs, and settlement agreements and the survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims for 2004, 2003 and 2002 excluding these commutations, policy buy-backs, and settlement agreements, are represented in the following table.
2004 2003 2002 (in millions, except ratios) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Asbestos claims Commutations, policy buy-backs & settlement agreements $ 32 $ 22 $ 54 $ 33 $ 118 $ 102 Annual survival ratio 25.2 25.5 22.7 24.2 9.5 10.3 3-year survival ratio 31.7 28.4 21.9 22.2 11.0 12.5 Environmental claims Commutations, policy buy-backs & settlement agreements $ 22 $ 14 $ 42 $ 24 $ 29 $ 22 Annual survival ratio 21.7 20.7 8.4 10.0 6.6 6.9 3-year survival ratio 9.7 10.0 7.7 8.4 9.7 9.5 Combined environmental and asbestos claims Total commutations, policy buy-backs & settlement agreements $ 54 $ 36 $ 96 $ 57 $ 147 $ 124 Annual survival ratio 24.8 24.7 17.7 19.0 8.4 8.9 3-year survival ratio 25.6 22.6 16.7 16.9 10.6 11.3 Our three-year net average survival ratio excluding commutations, policy buy-backs, and settlement agreements is viewed to be another measure of current reserve adequacy. Now at 28.4years for asbestos as of December31, 2004, we consider it to represent a strong reserve position. A one-year increase in the three-year average asbestos survival ratio at December31, 2004 would require an after-tax increase in reserves of approximately $34million.
Our net asbestos reserves by type of exposure and total reserve additions are shown in the following table.
December31, 2004 December31, 2003 December31, 2002 (in millions) Active Policy- holders Net Reserves % of Reserves Active Policy- holders Net Reserves % of Reserves Active Policy- holders Net Reserves % of Reserves Direct policyholders: Primary 52 $ 23 2 % 52 $ 28 3 % 40 $ 16 2 % Excess 322 297 20 286 201 19 240 87 14 Total 374 320 22 % 338 229 22 % 280 103 16 % Assumed reinsurance 222 15 191 17 173 27 IBNR claims 922 63 659 61 359 57 Total net reserves $ 1,464 100 % $ 1,079 100 % $ 635 100 % Total reserve additions $ 463 $ 514 (1) $ 121 (1) Excludes a $6million increase in the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables.
During the last three years, 211 direct primary and excess policyholders reported new claims, and 99 policyholders were closed, increasing the number of active policyholders by 112 during the period. The 112 increase comprised 36 from 2004, 58 from 2003 and 18 from 2002. The increase of 36 from 2004 55 included 64 new policyholders reporting new claims and 28 policyholders' claims were closed. Reserve additions for asbestos for the year ended December31, 2004, totaled $463million and included the following factors:  Direct primary insurance net reserves decreased by $5million. We were not a significant direct primary insurer and did not insure any of the large asbestos manufacturers on a direct primary insurance basis.
Direct excess insurance net reserves increased by $96million for policyholders with existing active claims. The increase in existing active claims was attributable to an increase in the number of claims filed against direct excess insureds.
Assumed reinsurance net reserves increased by $31million for increased cessions as ceding companies (other insurance carriers) also experienced increased claim activity. Many of the insureds that reported claims to us on their direct excess insurance coverages also reported claims to carriers included in our assumed reinsurance exposure. The number of reported new claims is shown in the following table.
Year ended December31,2004 Year ended December31,2003 Year ended December31,2002 New Claims (1) 361 265 197 (1) New claims are defined as the aggregate number of policyholders with claims reported by all ceding companies.
IBNR net reserves increased by $263million in anticipation of continued claims activity. At December31, 2004 IBNR represented 63.0% of total asbestos reserves, 2 points higher than at December31, 2003. IBNR reserves are estimated to provide for probable future unfavorable reserve development of known claims and future reporting of additional unknown claims from current and new direct active insurance policyholders and ceding companies.
Our non-products case reserves represent approximately 3.9% of total asbestos case reserves. We do not anticipate significant changes in this percentage as insureds' retentions associated with excess insurance programs and assumed reinsurance exposure are seldom exceeded. We did not write direct primary insurance on policyholders with the potential for significant non-products-related loss exposure.
For environmental exposures, a comprehensive "ground up" review, using processes similar to those used for the asbestos review, is also conducted in the third quarter of each year. The analysis performed in 2004 and 2003 produced essentially no change in reserve estimates. Environmental loss emergence in 2002 was primarily due to losses from one large reinsurance contract and a few other direct losses. In past years environmental reestimates have been favorable.
Pending, new, total closed and closed without payment claims for asbestos and environmental exposures for the years ended December31, are summarized in the following table.
Number of Claims 2004 2003 2002 Asbestos Pending, beginning of year 8,210 6,900 6,426 New 1,959 2,267 1,165 Total closed (1,539 ) (957 ) (691 ) Pending, end of year 8,630 8,210 6,900 Closed without payment 805 594 444 56 Environmental Pending, beginning of year 6,100 7,352 8,486 New 1,125 954 845 Total closed (1,450 ) (2,206 ) (1,979 ) Pending, end of year 5,775 6,100 7,352 Closed without payment 1,006 1,776 1,442 Our reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures could be affected by tort reform, class action litigation, and other potential legislation and judicial decisions. Environmental exposures could also be affected by a change in the existing federal Superfund law and similar state statutes. There can be no assurance that any reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair, effective and cost-efficient system for settlement of asbestos or environmental claims. We are unable to determine the effect, if any, that such legislation will have on results of operations or financial position.
Reserves for Other Discontinued Lines provide for remaining loss and loss expense liabilities related to business no longer written by us, other than asbestos and environmental, and are presented in the following table.
(in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Other mass torts $ 205 $ 234 $ 236 Workers' compensation 152 132 137 Commercial and other 274 135 118 Other discontinued lines $ 631 $ 501 $ 491 Other mass torts describes excess and reinsurance general liability coverage provided for cumulative injury losses other than asbestos and environmental. Workers' compensation and commercial and other include run-off from discontinued primary, excess and reinsurance commercial insurance operations of various coverage exposures other than asbestos and environmental. Reserves are based on considerations similar to those previously described, as they relate to the characteristics of specific individual coverage exposures.
We believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on assessments of pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure (e.g. claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure) presented by individual policyholders, assuming no change in the legal, legislative or economic environment. Another comprehensive "ground up" review will be completed in the third quarter of 2005, as well as assessments each quarter to determine if any intervening significant events or developments require an interim adjustment to reserves.
Property-Liability Reinsurance Ceded We participate in various reinsurance mechanisms, including industry pools and facilities, and have purchased reinsurance to mitigate long-tail liability lines, including environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures. We retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers.
57 The impacts of reinsurance on our reserve for claims and claims expense at December31 are summarized in the following table, net of allowances we have established for uncollectible amounts.
Gross claims and claims expense reserves Reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid claims, net (in millions) 2004 2003 2004 2003 Industry pools and facilities $ 2,217 $ 902 $ 1,596 $ 829 Asbestos and environmental 2,708 1,898 1,045 636 Other including allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables 14,413 14,914 86 439 Total Property-Liability $ 19,338 $ 17,714 $ 2,727 $ 1,904 When purchasing reinsurance, we evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer, as well as the terms and price of coverage. Estimating amounts of reinsurance recoverables is also impacted by the uncertainties involved in the establishment of loss reserves. We believe the recoverables are appropriately established; however, as our underlying reserves continue to develop, the amount ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded. We regularly evaluate the reinsurers and the respective amounts recoverable, and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed.
Adverse developments in the insurance industry have recently led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers, causing amounts recoverable from them and future claims ceded to them to be considered a higher risk. Recently there has also been consolidation activity between some of our carriers and potential carriers in the industry, which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer companies. In addition, over the last several years the industry has increasingly segregated asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities with dedicated capital. Regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported these actions. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, that these developments will have on the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables in the future.
The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance relates to Discontinued Lines and Coverages reinsurance recoverables and was $230million and $101million at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These amounts represent 16.9% and 8.6%, respectively of the related reinsurance recoverable balances. The increase in 2004 is due to potential uncollectible reinsurance related to the asbestos reserve increase and the refinement of our bad debt allowance to provide a greater allowance for companies who have reorganized to segregate asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities with dedicated capital.
58 The ten largest reinsurance recoverable balances are shown in the following table at December31, net of allowances we have established for uncollectible amounts.

We enter into certain inter-company insurance and reinsurance transactions for the Property-Liability operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
ALLSTATE FINANCIAL 2004 HIGHLIGHTS  Allstate Financial revenues increased 0.6% in 2004 compared to 2003. Increased net investment income, higher contract charges and improved realized capital gains and losses, were offset by lower premiums resulting from the disposal of substantially all of our direct response distribution business and a decline in premiums on immediate annuities with life contingencies.
Income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after-tax, increased 30.7% in 2004 compared to 2003 as higher revenues and lower contract benefits and operating costs and expenses were partially offset by higher interest credited and DAC amortization. Net income decreased to $246million in 2004 from $305million in 2003. This decrease was attributable to a $175million after-tax charge related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for Statement of Position No.03-1, "Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain 59 Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts" ("SOP 03-1"), which was adopted on January1, 2004.
Total investments increased 15.3% in 2004 due to the investment of cash provided by operating and financing activities, which included record annual contractholder fund deposits.
Contractholder fund deposits totaled $13.88billion for 2004 compared to $10.63billion in 2003. The increase of $3.25billion was primarily attributable to deposits from fixed annuities, interest-sensitive life policies and institutional funding agreements.
When comparing 2004 to 2003, the disposal of substantially all of our direct response distribution business resulted in the following impacts to the Consolidated Statements of Operations: (in millions) Favorable (unfavorable): Total revenues $ (233 ) Contract benefits 122 Amortization of DAC 37 Operating costs and expenses 73 Loss on disposition of operations 24 Income tax expense (8 ) Net income $ 15 ALLSTATE FINANCIAL SEGMENT Overview and Strategy The Allstate Financial segment is a major provider of life insurance, retirement and investment products to individual and institutional customers.

Contract charges are revenues generated from interest-sensitive life, variable annuities, fixed annuities and institutional products for which deposits are classified as contractholder funds or separate accounts liabilities. Contract charges are assessed against the contractholder account values for maintenance, administration, cost of insurance and surrender prior to contractually specified dates. As a result, changes in contractholder funds and separate accounts liabilities are considered in the evaluation of growth and as indicators of future levels of revenues.
61 The following table summarizes premiums and contract charges by product.
(in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Premiums Traditional life $ 321 $ 388 $ 403 Immediate annuities with life contingencies 316 413 416 Accident and health and other 408 564 552 Total premiums 1,045 1,365 1,371 Contract charges Interest-sensitive life 729 688 672 Fixed annuities 52 37 32 Variable annuities 246 206 212 Institutional products  8 6 Total contract charges 1,027 939 922 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges $ 2,072 $ 2,304 $ 2,293 The following table summarizes premiums and contract charges by distribution channel.
(in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Premiums Allstate agencies $ 395 $ 319 $ 278 Independent agents 356 373 351 Specialized brokers 243 390 415 Direct marketing 51 283 327 Total premiums 1,045 1,365 1,371 Contract charges Allstate agencies 462 440 429 Independent agents 301 279 271 Broker dealers 199 172 183 Banks 35 15 14 Specialized brokers 27 30 25 Direct marketing 3 3  Total contract charges 1,027 939 922 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges $ 2,072 $ 2,304 $ 2,293 Total premiums decreased 23.4% in 2004 compared to 2003. The decrease was primarily due to the disposal of substantially all of our direct response distribution business, which resulted in lower accident and health and other premiums and traditional life premiums. Additionally, 2004 reflects lower premiums on immediate annuities with life contingencies as underwriting actions taken in 2003 reduced the maximum premium received on individual contracts sold.
Total premiums decreased 0.4% in 2003 compared to 2002. The decrease was primarily the result of the discontinuance of the majority of our direct response business in 2003, lower traditional life and immediate annuity premium, partially offset by higher premiums from supplemental accident and health and other products sold through the workplace.
62 Contract charges increased 9.4% in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase was primarily due to higher contract charges on interest-sensitive life and variable annuities. The increase in the interest-sensitive life contract charges was attributable to in-force business growth resulting from deposits and credited interest more than offsetting contract charges, surrenders and benefits. Higher variable annuity contract charges were the result of increased average account values during 2004, reflecting positive investment results during 2003 and 2004. Variable annuity contract charges, as a percent of average separate account values, increased to 175 basis points in 2004 from 166 basis points in 2003 driven by increases in fees charged for our variable annuity benefits on the Allstate Advisor product in addition to a higher percentage of our in-force contracts providing these benefits.
Contract charges increased 1.8% in 2003 compared to 2002. The slight increase was the result of higher interest-sensitive life contract charges resulting from in-force business growth, partially offset by lower variable annuity contract charges on lower average variable annuity account balances during the period. Variable annuity contract charges, as a percent of average separate account values, increased to 166 basis points in 2003 from 163 basis points in 2002 as a result of increases in benefit rider fee rates and utilization by contractholders.
Contractholder funds represent interest-bearing liabilities arising from the sale of individual and institutional products, such as interest-sensitive life, fixed annuities, bank deposits and funding agreements. The balance of contractholder funds is equal to the cumulative deposits received and interest credited to the contractholder less cumulative contract maturities, benefits, surrenders, withdrawals and contract charges for mortality or administrative expenses.
63 The following table shows the changes in contractholder funds.
(in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Contractholder funds, beginning balance $ 47,071 $ 40,751 $ 33,560 Impact of adoption of SOP 03-1 (1) 421   Deposits Fixed annuities (immediate and deferred) 7,322 5,266 4,971 Retail funding agreements 85   Institutional products (primarily funding agreements) 3,902 2,713 1,873 Interest-sensitive life 1,375 1,074 964 Variable annuity and life deposits allocated to fixed accounts 495 893 1,212 Bank and other deposits 701 681 498 Total deposits 13,880 10,627 9,518 Interest credited 1,991 1,846 1,764 Maturities, benefits, withdrawals and other adjustments Maturities of institutional products (2,518 ) (2,163 ) (1,056 ) Benefits (729 ) (505 ) (429 ) Surrenders and partial withdrawals (3,438 ) (2,728 ) (2,093 ) Contract charges (655 ) (622 ) (567 ) Net transfers to separate accounts (412 ) (416 ) (474 ) Fair value hedge adjustments for institutional products 38 131 363 Other adjustments 60 150 165 Total maturities, benefits, withdrawals and other adjustments (7,654 ) (6,153 ) (4,091 ) Contractholder funds, ending balance $ 55,709 $ 47,071 $ 40,751 (1) The increase in contractholder funds due to the adoption of SOP03-1 reflects the reclassification of certain products previously included as a component of separate accounts to contractholder funds, the reclassification of deferred sales inducements ("DSI") from contractholder funds to other assets and the establishment of reserves for certain liabilities that are primarily related to income and death benefit guarantees provided under fixed annuity, variable annuity and interest-sensitive life contracts.
Contractholder deposits increased 30.6% in 2004 compared to 2003 due primarily to greater issuances of fixed annuities, interest-sensitive life policies and retail and institutional funding agreements. These deposits led to an increase in average contractholder funds, excluding the impact of adopting SOP 03-1, of 16.6% in 2004 compared to 2003. Fixed annuity deposits increased 39.0% in 2004 compared to 2003 due to strong consumer demand, competitive pricing and effective distribution efforts in our bank channel. Institutional product deposits increased 43.8% in 2004 compared to 2003, largely due to favorable market conditions for our funding agreements and the broadening of our customer base through the development and launch of our new Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") registered program in the second quarter of 2004 and our new registered RMTN program in the fourth quarter. The registered programs generated $1.74billion of new funding agreement deposits during the year including $85million in RMTN deposits.
Benefits, surrenders and partial withdrawals increased 28.9% in 2004 compared to 2003 reflecting a withdrawal rate of 11.2% for 2004 based on the beginning of period contractholder funds balance excluding institutional product reserves. This compares to a withdrawal rate of 10.2% and 9.7% for 2003 64 and 2002 respectively. Surrenders and withdrawals may vary with changes in interest rates and equity market conditions and the aging of our in-force contracts.
Contractholder deposits increased 11.7% in 2003 compared to 2002, and average contractholder funds increased 18.2% in 2003 compared to 2002, due to significant increases in institutional product and fixed annuity deposits in 2003. Fixed annuity deposits increased 5.9% over 2002 due to competitive pricing and our decision to maintain a market presence despite a challenging interest rate environment. Institutional products deposits increased 44.8% largely due to our assessment of market opportunities.
Separate accounts liabilities represent contractholders' claims to the related separate accounts assets. Separate accounts liabilities primarily arise from the sale of variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies. The following table shows the changes in separate accounts liabilities.
(in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Separate accounts liabilities, beginning balance $ 13,425 $ 11,125 $ 13,587 Impact of adoption of SOP 03-1 (1) (204 )   Variable annuity and life deposits 1,763 2,284 2,432 Variable annuity and life deposits allocated to fixed accounts (495 ) (893 ) (1,212 ) Net deposits 1,268 1,391 1,220 Investment results 1,348 2,393 (2,167 ) Contract charges (256 ) (220 ) (212 ) Net transfers from fixed accounts 412 416 474 Surrenders and benefits (1,616 ) (1,680 ) (1,777 ) Separate accounts liabilities, ending balance $ 14,377 $ 13,425 $ 11,125 (1) The decrease in separate accounts due to the adoption of SOP 03-1 reflects the reclassification of certain products previously included as a component of separate accounts to contractholder funds.
Separate accounts liabilities, excluding the impact of adopting SOP 03-1, increased $1.16billion during 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to positive investment results. Net deposits and transfers from fixed accounts were mostly offset by surrenders and benefits. Variable annuity contractholders often allocate a significant portion of their initial variable annuity contract deposit into a fixed rate investment option. The level of this activity is reflected above in the deposits allocated to fixed accounts, while all other transfer activity between the fixed and separate accounts investment options is reflected in net transfers from fixed accounts. The liability for the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts is reflected in contractholder funds.
Separate accounts liabilities increased $2.30billion during 2003 compared to 2002 reflecting a significant improvement in investment results and net deposits, partially offset by surrenders and benefits. The increase in the variable annuity net deposits in 2003 resulted from the increasing attractiveness of the separate accounts equity investment funds following improved equity market performance and the introduction of the multi-manager Allstate Advisor variable annuity product.
Net investment income increased 5.5% in 2004 compared to 2003 and 3.6% in 2003 compared to 2002. The increase in both periods was the result of the effect of higher portfolio balances, partially offset by lower portfolio yields. Higher portfolio balances resulted from the investment of cash flows from operating and financing activities related primarily to deposits from fixed annuities and interest-sensitive 65 life policies and institutional funding agreements. Investment balances as of December31, 2004, increased 15.3% from December31, 2003 and increased 13.8% as of December31, 2003 compared to December31, 2002. The lower portfolio yields were primarily due to purchases, including reinvestments, of fixed income securities with yields lower than the current portfolio average.
Net income analysis is presented in the following table.
(in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges $ 2,072 $ 2,304 $ 2,293 Net investment income 3,410 3,233 3,121 Periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments (1) 49 23 5 Contract benefits (1,618 ) (1,851 ) (1,770 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds (2) (1,956 ) (1,846 ) (1,764 ) Gross margin 1,957 1,863 1,885 Amortization of DAC and DSI (498 ) (492 ) (476 ) Operating costs and expenses (634 ) (672 ) (649 ) Restructuring and related charges (5 ) (7 ) (2 ) Income tax expense (269 ) (243 ) (202 ) Realized capital gains and losses, after-tax (3 ) (53 ) (287 ) DAC and DSI amortization relating to realized capital gains and losses, after-tax (89 ) (30 ) (1 ) Reclassification of periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments, after-tax (32 ) (15 ) (3 ) Loss on disposition of operations, after-tax (6 ) (29 ) (4 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after-tax (175 ) (17 ) (283 ) Net income (loss) $ 246 $ 305 $ (22 ) (1) Periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments are reflected as a component of realized capital gains and losses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
(2) Beginning in 2004, amortization of DSI is excluded from interest credited to contractholder funds for purposes of calculating gross margin. Amortization of DSI totaled $45million in 2004. Prior periods have not been restated.
Gross margin , a non-GAAP measure, represents life and annuity premiums and contract charges and net investment income, less contract benefits and interest credited to contractholder funds. We use gross margin as a component of our evaluation of the profitability of Allstate Financial's life insurance and financial product portfolio. Additionally, for many of our products, including fixed annuities, variable life and annuities, and interest-sensitive life insurance, the amortization of DAC and DSI is determined based on actual and expected gross margin. Gross margin is comprised of four components that are utilized to further analyze the business: investment margin, benefit margin, maintenance charges and surrender charges. We believe gross margin and its components are useful to investors because they allow for the evaluation of income components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance. Gross margin, investment margin and benefit margin should not be considered as a substitute for net income and do not reflect the overall profitability of the business. Net income is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to these margins. Gross margin is reconciled to Allstate Financial's GAAP net income in the table above.
66 The components of gross margin are reconciled to the corresponding financial statement line items in the following table.
2004 (in millions) Investment Margin Benefit Margin Maintenance Charges Surrender Charges Gross Margin Life and annuity premiums $  $ 1,045 $  $  $ 1,045 Contract charges  558 393 76 1,027 Net investment income 3,410    3,410 Periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments (1) 49    49 Contract benefits (538 ) (1,080 )   (1,618 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds (2) (1,956 )    (1,956 ) $ 965 $ 523 $ 393 $ 76 $ 1,957 2003 (in millions) Investment Margin Benefit Margin Maintenance Charges Surrender Charges Gross Margin Life and annuity premiums $  $ 1,365 $  $  $ 1,365 Contract charges  518 342 79 939 Net investment income 3,233    3,233 Periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments (1) 23    23 Contract benefits (514 ) (1,337 )   (1,851 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds (1,846 )    (1,846 ) $ 896 $ 546 $ 342 $ 79 $ 1,863 2002 (in millions) Investment Margin Benefit Margin Maintenance Charges Surrender Charges Gross Margin Life and annuity premiums $  $ 1,371 $  $  $ 1,371 Contract charges  505 342 75 922 Net investment income 3,121    3,121 Periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments (1) 5    5 Contract benefits (493 ) (1,277 )   (1,770 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds (1,764 )    (1,764 ) $ 869 $ 599 $ 342 $ 75 $ 1,885 (1) Periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments are reflected as a component of realized capital gains and losses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
(2) Beginning in 2004, amortization of DSI is excluded from interest credited to contractholder funds for purposes of calculating gross margin. Amortization of DSI totaled $45million for the year ended December31, 2004. Prior periods have not been restated.
67 Gross margin increased 5.0% in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase was attributable to increased investment margin and higher maintenance charges, partially offset by lower benefit margin. Gross margin declined 1.2% in 2003 compared to 2002 as an increased investment margin was more than offset by lower benefit margin.
Investment margin is a component of gross margin, both of which are non-GAAP measures. Investment margin represents the excess of net investment income over interest credited to contractholder funds and the implied interest on life-contingent immediate annuities included in the reserve for life-contingent contract benefits. We use investment margin to evaluate Allstate Financial's profitability related to the difference between investment returns on assets supporting certain products and amounts credited to customers ("spread") during a fiscal period.
Investment margin by product group is shown in the following table.
(in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Annuities $ 620 $ 546 $ 505 Life insurance 212 234 249 Institutional products 121 107 107 Bank and other 12 9 8 Total investment margin $ 965 $ 896 $ 869 Investment margin increased 7.7% in 2004 compared to 2003 and increased 3.1% in 2003 compared to 2002. Both increases were primarily due to higher contractholder funds and actions to reduce crediting rates, partially offset by lower portfolio yields. The difference between the weighted average crediting rate and the average guaranteed rate on interest-sensitive life and deferred annuities, excluding market value adjusted annuities and equity indexed annuities, was 52 basis points as of December31, 2004 compared with 70 basis points as of December31, 2003 and 140 basis points as of December31, 2002. The crediting rates on approximately 62% of these contracts were at the minimum guaranteed rate at December31, 2004.
The following table summarizes the annualized weighted average investment yield, interest crediting rates and investment spreads during 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Benefit margin represents life and life-contingent immediate annuity premiums and cost of insurance contract charges less contract benefits. Benefit margin excludes the implied interest on life-contingent immediate annuities, which is included in the calculation of investment margin, and mortality charges on variable annuities, which are included as a component of maintenance charges. We use the benefit margin to evaluate Allstate Financial's underwriting performance, as it reflects the profitability of our products with respect to mortality or morbidity risk during a fiscal period.
Benefit margin by product group is shown in the following table.
(in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Life insurance $ 608 $ 658 $ 666 Annuities (85 ) (112 ) (67 ) Total benefit margin $ 523 $ 546 $ 599 Benefit margin decreased 4.2% in 2004 compared to 2003. This decline was primarily the result of the disposal of substantially all of our direct response distribution business and unfavorable mortality experience on life-contingent immediate annuities, partially offset by an improved benefit margin on life insurance products and lower contract benefits related to guaranteed minimum death benefits ("GMDBs") on variable annuities.
As required by SOP 03-1, as of January1, 2004, a reserve was established for benefits provided for under variable annuities and secondary guarantees on interest-sensitive life insurance and certain fixed annuity contracts. For variable annuities, the reserve includes GMDBs and guaranteed minimum income benefits ("GMIBs"). In previous periods, GMDBs were expensed as paid and no costs were recognizable for GMIBs or other guarantees. Under the SOP, we anticipate that the benefit margin will be less volatile, as contract benefit expense pertaining to product guarantees will be proportionate to the related revenue rather than cash payments made during the period. Included in the benefit margin for 2004 are additions to these secondary product guarantee reserves of $46million for variable annuities, net of reinsurance and hedging gains and losses and $3million for fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life policies.
69 Included in the benefit margin for 2003 are GMDB payments of $83million, net of reinsurance, hedging gains and losses and other contractual arrangements. For further explanation of the impacts of the adoption of this accounting guidance, see Note2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Benefit margin was $546million in 2003, reflecting a $53million or 8.8% decline compared to 2002. An increase in GMDBs on variable annuity contracts in 2003 compared to 2002 represents $30million of the $53million decline. The remainder was due to a larger number of life claims in the first quarter of 2003, poor mortality results on certain closed blocks of business and the effect of the discontinuance of direct response non-life credit insurance, partially offset by higher mortality margin from growth of interest-sensitive life and accident and health products sold through the workplace. In 2003, GMDB payments were $83million, net of reinsurance, hedging results and other contractual arrangements ("net GMDB payments"), compared to $53million in 2002. While 2003 net GMDB payments were higher than in 2002, improved equity market performance during 2003 resulted in sequential quarterly reductions in gross GMDB payments. Direct response non-life credit insurance generated a benefit margin of $2million and $7million in 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Amortization of DAC and DSI increased 1.2% during 2004 compared to 2003. The higher amortization is reflective of increased gross margins on fixed and variable annuities. In 2003, amortization of DAC and DSI included an acceleration of DAC amortization (commonly referred to as "DAC unlocking") totaling $89million and $37million of DAC amortization on the direct response distribution business sold in 2004.
The adoption of SOP 03-1 required a new modeling approach for estimating expected future gross profits that are used when determining the amortization of DAC. Because of this new modeling approach, effective January1, 2004, the variable annuity DAC and DSI assets were reduced by $124million. This reduction was recognized as a component of cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
Amortization of DAC increased 3.4% during 2003 compared to 2002. The increase was primarily due to in-force business growth, partially offset by decreased amortization from lower gross margins on variable annuities and certain fixed annuities. Net DAC unlocking totaled $89million and $94million in 2003 and 2002.
We performed our annual comprehensive evaluation of DAC assumptions in the first quarter of 2003 and concluded that, due to sustained poor performance of the equity markets coupled with an expectation of moderate future performance due to continuing weakness in the U.S. economy and uncertainty in the geopolitical environment, it was no longer reasonably possible that variable annuity fund returns would revert to the expected long-term mean within the time horizon used in our reversion to the mean model.
The changes in the DAC asset are summarized in the following tables.

(2) The impact of adoption of SOP 03-1 includes a write-down in variable annuity DAC of $108million, the reclassification of DSI from DAC to other assets resulting in a decrease to DAC of $44million, an increase to DAC of $8million for an adjustment to the effect of unrealized capital gains and losses and the reclassification of unearned revenue from DAC to contractholder funds resulting in an increase to DAC of $10million.
(3) The amortization of DAC for interest-sensitive life, variable annuities and investment contracts is proportionate to the recognition of actual gross profits, which include realized capital gains and losses. The increase in amortization in 2004 compared to 2003 was due in part to the effect of realized capital gains and losses that were in excess of those utilized in the determination of EGP. Amortization related to realized capital gains and losses was $120million and $46million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Future amortization will be affected by the recognition of actual realized capital gains and losses to the extent that they differ from those utilized in the determination of EGP.
Operating costs and expenses decreased 5.7% in 2004 compared to 2003 and increased 3.5% in 2003 compared to 2002. The following table summarizes operating costs and expenses.

Excluding the impact of the disposition, non-deferrable acquisition costs increased due to higher non-deferrable renewal commissions; taxes, licenses and fees; and costs related to loss experience on certain credit insurance policies. For other operating costs and expenses, the decline due to the disposition was partially offset by higher technology and employee related expenses.
The increase in total operating costs and expenses in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to higher non-deferrable commissions. Other operating costs and expenses in 2003 compared to 2002 decreased as higher employee benefit and technology related costs were more than offset by lower litigation expense 71 Net realized capital gains and losses are presented in the following table for the years ended December31.

Reinsurance Ceded We enter into reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated carriers to limit our risk of mortality losses. As of December31, 2004 and 2003, 49% and 44%, respectively, of our face amount of life insurance in force is reinsured. In 2004, for certain term life insurance policies, we ceded 25-100% of the mortality risk depending on the length of the term and policy premium guarantees. Comparatively, in 2003, mortality risk ceded on certain term life insurance policies was in the range of 60-100%, depending on the length of the term and policy premium guarantees. Additionally, we cede 100% of the morbidity risk on our long-term care contracts. Since 1998, we have ceded the mortality risk on new life contracts that exceed $2million per individual, whereas prior to 1998, we ceded mortality risk in excess of specific amounts up to $1million per life for individual coverage. Also, on certain in-force variable annuity contracts we cede 100% of the mortality and certain other risks related to product features. We retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers.
The impacts of reinsurance on our reserve for life-contingent contract benefits at December31, are summarized in the following table.
Reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid claims (in millions) 2004 2003 Life insurance (1) $ 1,010 $ 836 Long-term care 315 180 Other (1) 271 201 Total Allstate Financial $ 1,596 $ 1,217 (1) As of December31, 2004, life insurance and other include $97million and $72million, respectively, related to the disposal of substantially all of our direct response distribution business.
Estimating amounts of reinsurance recoverables is impacted by the uncertainties involved in the establishment of reserves.
Developments in the insurance industry have led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers, causing amounts recoverable from them to be considered a higher risk. There has also been consolidation activity between reinsurers in the industry, which has resulted in reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer companies. As a result, we have increased our percentage of underwriting retention of new term life insurance policies by approximately 20-30% on average depending on product mix.
72 Our reinsurance recoverables, summarized by the reinsurers' Standard& Poor's financial strength ratings as of December31, are shown in the following table. In certain cases, these ratings refer to the financial strength of the affiliated group or parent company of the reinsurer.

The amount included as a component of the other category reflects two of three unrelated third party purchasers of the business for which Standard and Poor's does not rate. These two insurers are rated A+ (Superior) and A (Excellent) byA.M. Best. Furthermore, the other category, at December31, 2004, includes $184million related to the reinsurance recoverables of acquired entities, of which $176million is collateralized by an investment trust.

73 We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of reinsurers in order to determine our risk of recoverability on an individual and aggregate basis, and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed. No amounts have been deemed unrecoverable in the three-years ended December31, 2004.
We enter into certain inter-company reinsurance transactions for the Allstate Financial operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Allstate Financial Outlook  Our ability to grow our investment margin depends upon maintaining sufficient spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates, and growing the amount of business in force. As interest rates rise, we expect a gradual increase in investment yields. The amount by which these higher yields will increase our investment margin depends upon the amount and pace at which we reset interest-crediting rates, which could be influenced by market conditions and the actions of our policyholders. A significant and sudden increase in interest rates could cause policyholders to exercise surrender provisions in their policies that might cause investment margins to decline. As a result, growth in our investment margin from net new business activity could be partially offset by compression in our in-force investment margins.
If equity markets perform at historical norms, we expect to see positive growth in our variable annuity gross margins from increased revenue. However, improvements or deteriorations in our variable annuity gross margins from changes in equity market performance or policyholder retention creates a proportional increase or decrease in amortization of variable annuity DAC, which will offset a significant portion of the changes in gross margins.
Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. To eliminate some of these market concerns, we are expecting to retain more of our term life insurance mortality risk in 2005. This change will not have a discernable effect on our net income in the short-term, but will provide the foundation to drive increased long-term growth in our life insurance business. Our mortality margins will also be more volatile in the future as we retain and manage more of our mortality risk, which will require increased statutory capital.
INVESTMENTS An important component of our financial results is the return on our investment portfolios. Investment portfolios are segmented between the Property-Liability, Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other operations. The investment portfolios are managed based upon the nature of each respective business and its corresponding liability structure.
Overview and Strategy The Property-Liability portfolio's investment strategy emphasizes safety of principal and consistent income generation, within a total return framework. This approach, which has produced competitive returns over time, is designed to ensure financial strength and stability for paying claims, while maximizing economic value and surplus growth. We employ a strategic asset allocation model, which takes into account the nature of the liabilities and risk tolerances, as well as the risk/return parameters of the various asset classes in which we invest. The model's recommended asset allocation, along with duration and liquidity considerations, guides our initial asset allocation. This is further adjusted based on our analysis of relative value opportunities in different markets. As part of our total return framework, we may sell securities during the period in which fair value has declined below amortized cost 74 for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities. Portfolio performance is measured against outside benchmarks at target allocation weights. Portfolio reviews, which include identifying securities that are other than temporarily impaired, are conducted regularly. For more information, see the Portfolio Monitoring section of the MD&A.
The Allstate Financial portfolio's investment strategy focuses on the need for risk-adjusted spread on the underlying liabilities while maximizing return on capital. We believe investment spread is maximized by selecting assets that perform favorably on a long-term basis and by disposing of certain assets to minimize the effect of downgrades and defaults. We believe this strategy maintains the investment margin necessary to sustain income over time. The portfolio management approach employs a combination of recognized market, analytical and proprietary modeling, including a strategic asset allocation model, as the primary basis for the allocation of interest sensitive, illiquid and credit assets as well as for determining overall below investment grade exposure and diversification requirements. Within the targets set by the strategic asset allocation model, tactical investment decisions are made in consideration of prevailing market conditions. Portfolio reviews, which include identifying securities that are other than temporarily impaired, are conducted regularly. For more information, see the Portfolio Monitoring section of the MD&A.
Portfolio Composition The composition of the investment portfolios at December31, 2004 is presented in the table below. Also see Notes 2 and 5 of the consolidated financial statements for investment accounting policies and additional information.

Amortized cost basis for these securities was $30.97billion, $58.03billion and $1.66billion for Property-Liability, Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other, respectively.
(2) Equity securities are carried at fair value. Cost basis for these securities was $4.30billion, $212million, and $52million for Property-Liability, Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other, respectively.
Total investments increased to $115.53billion at December31, 2004 from $103.08billion at December31, 2003, primarily due to positive cash flows from operating and financing activities and increased funds associated with securities lending.
The Property-Liability investment portfolio increased to $40.27billion at December31, 2004 from $37.86billion at December31, 2003, due to positive cash flows from operating activities, partially offset by dividends paid by AIC to The Allstate Corporation and decreased net unrealized gains on fixed income securities.
The Allstate Financial investment portfolio increased to $72.53billion at December31, 2004, from $62.90billion at December31, 2003, primarily due to positive cash flows from operating and financing activities and increased funds associated with securities lending.
75 The Corporate and Other investment portfolio increased to $2.73billion at December31, 2004, from $2.33billion at December31, 2003. This increase primarily reflects additional investments made in the portfolio of Kennett Capital,Inc. ("Kennett Capital"), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Allstate Corporation.
Total investments at amortized cost related to collateral, primarily due to securities lending, increased to $4.85billion at December31, 2004, from $3.75billion at December31, 2003.
We use different methodologies to estimate the fair value of publicly and non-publicly traded marketable investment securities and exchange traded and non-exchange traded derivative contracts. For a discussion of these methods, see the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A.
The following table shows total investments, categorized by the method used to determine fair value at December31, 2004.
Investments Derivative Contracts Fair Value Percent to total (in millions) Fair Value Value based on independent market quotations $ 91,063 78.8 % $ 57 Value based on models and other valuation methods 13,582 11.8 898 Mortgage loans, policy loans, bank loans and certain limited partnership investments, valued at cost, amortized cost and the equity method 10,885 9.4  Total $ 115,530 100.0 % $ 955 Fixed Income Securities See Note5 of the consolidated financial statements for a table showing the amortized cost, unrealized gains, unrealized losses and fair value for each type of fixed income security for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003.
Municipal bonds, including tax-exempt and taxable securities, totaled $26.33billion and 96.8% were rated investment grade at December31, 2004. Approximately 62.6% of the municipal bond portfolio was insured by seven bond insurers and accordingly have a rating of Aaa or Aa. The municipal bond portfolio at December31, 2004 consisted of approximately 3,500 issues from approximately 2,500 issuers. The largest exposure to a single issuer was less than 1.1% of the municipal bond portfolio. Corporate entities were the ultimate obligors of approximately 10.3% of the municipal bond portfolio.
Corporate bonds totaled $40.38billion and 89.1% were rated investment grade at December31, 2004. As of December31, 2004, the portfolio contained $17.41billion of privately placed corporate obligations, 43.1% of the total corporate obligations in the portfolio, compared with $15.84billion at December31, 2003. Approximately $15.13billion or 86.9% of the privately placed corporate obligations consisted of fixed rate privately placed securities. The benefits of fixed rate privately placed securities when compared to publicly issued securities are generally higher yields, improved cash flow predictability through pro-rata sinking funds, and a combination of covenant and call protection features designed to better protect the holder against losses resulting from credit deterioration, reinvestment risk or fluctuations in interest rates. A disadvantage of fixed rate privately placed securities when compared to publicly issued securities is relatively reduced liquidity. At December31, 2004, 86.3% of the privately placed securities were rated investment grade.
Foreign government securities totaled $2.70billion and 93.7% were rated investment grade at December31, 2004.
76 Mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") totaled $9.22billion at December31, 2004, substantially all of which were investment grade. In our MBS portfolio, the credit risk associated with MBS is mitigated due to the fact that the portfolio consists primarily of securities that were issued by, or have underlying collateral that is guaranteed by, U.S. government agencies or U.S. government sponsored entities. The MBS portfolio is subject to interest rate risk since price volatility and the ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of prepayment of the underlying mortgages. The current consistently low interest rate environment has resulted in prepayments, which have eroded the prepayment protection in this portfolio over recent years.
Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities ("CMBS") totaled $6.92billion at December31, 2004. CMBS positions primarily represent pools of commercial mortgages, broadly diversified across property types and geographical area. The CMBS portfolio is subject to credit risk, but unlike other structured products, is generally not subject to prepayment risk. Due to protections within the underlying commercial mortgages, borrowers are restricted from prepaying their mortgages due to changes in interest rates. Credit defaults can result in credit directed prepayments. Approximately 81.6% of the CMBS portfolio had a Moody's rating of Aaa or a Standard& Poor's rating of AAA, the highest rating category, at December31, 2004.
Asset-backed securities ("ABS") totaled $6.00billion at December31, 2004. Our ABS portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk is managed by monitoring the performance of the collateral. In addition, many of the securities in the ABS portfolio are credit enhanced with features such as over-collateralization, subordinated debt, reserve funds, guarantees and/or insurance. Approximately 54.8% of the ABS portfolio had a Moody's rating of Aaa or a Standard& Poor's ("S&P") rating of AAA, the highest rating category. A portion of the ABS portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk since, for example, price volatility and ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of prepayment of the underlying assets. The ABS portfolio includes collateralized debt obligations and other bonds that are secured by a variety of asset types, predominately credit card receivables, home equity loans, and auto loans.
At December31, 2004, 94.1% of the consolidated fixed income securities portfolio was rated investment grade, which is defined as a security having a rating from The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") of 1 or 2; a rating of Aaa, Aa, A or Baa from Moody's or a rating of AAA, AA, A or BBB from S&P, Fitch or Dominion; or a comparable internal rating if an externally provided rating is not available.

The equity securities portfolio was $5.90billion at December31, 2004 compared to $5.29billion at December31, 2003. The increase is attributable to new money from operations. Gross unrealized gains totaled $1.34billion at December31, 2004 compared to $1.28billion at December31, 2003. Gross unrealized losses totaled $14million at December31, 2004 compared to $18million at December31, 2003.
Unrealized Gains and Losses See Note5 of the consolidated financial statements for further disclosures regarding unrealized losses on fixed income and equity securities and factors considered in determining whether they are not other than temporarily impaired. The unrealized net capital gains on fixed income and equity securities at December31, 2004 totaled $6.39billion, a decrease of $7million since December31, 2003. Gross unrealized losses on fixed income securities are provided in the table below.

The gross unrealized losses in these sectors were primarily interest rate related or company specific. Approximately $9million of the total gross unrealized losses in the corporate fixed income portfolio and $11million of the total gross unrealized losses in the asset-backed securities portfolio were associated with the airline industry for which values were generally depressed due to company specific issues and economic issues primarily related to fuel and labor costs. We expect eventual recovery of these securities. Every security was included in our portfolio monitoring process.
78 The following table shows the composition by credit quality of the fixed income securities with gross unrealized losses at December31, 2004.

It also includes 36 securities that have not yet received an NAIC rating, for which we have assigned a comparable internal rating, with a fair value totaling $668million and an unrealized loss of $7million. Due to lags between the funding of an investment, processing of final legal documents, filing with the Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC ("SVO"), and rating by the SVO, we will always have a small number of securities that have a pending rating.
At December31, 2004, $171million, or 75.0%, of the gross unrealized losses were related to investment grade fixed income securities. Unrealized losses on investment grade securities principally relate to changes in interest rates or changes in sector-related credit spreads since the securities were acquired.
As of December31, 2004, $57million of the gross unrealized losses were related to below investment grade fixed income securities. Of this amount, 26.0% were in a significant unrealized loss position (greater than or equal to 20% of amortized cost) for six or more consecutive months prior to December31, 2004. Included among the securities rated below investment grade are both public and privately placed high-yield bonds and securities that were investment grade when originally acquired. We mitigate the credit risk of investing in below investment grade fixed income securities by limiting the percentage of our fixed income portfolio invested in such securities, through diversification of the portfolio, and active credit monitoring and portfolio management.
The scheduled maturity dates for fixed income securities in an unrealized loss position at December31, 2004 is shown below. Actual maturities may differ from those scheduled as a result of prepayments by the issuers.

We expect eventual recovery of these securities. We included every security in our portfolio monitoring process.
Portfolio Monitoring We have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate fixed income and equity securities whose carrying value may be other than temporarily impaired. The process includes a quarterly review of all securities using a screening process to identify those securities whose fair value compared to amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities is below established thresholds for certain time periods, or which are identified through other monitoring criteria such as ratings downgrades or payment defaults. The securities identified, in addition to other securities for which we may have a concern, are evaluated based on facts and circumstances for inclusion on our watch-list. The watch-list is reviewed in detail to determine whether any other than temporary impairment exists.
80 The following table summarizes fixed income and equity securities in a gross unrealized loss position according to significance, aging and investment grade classification.

The largest individual unrealized loss was $3million for category(i), $1million for category(ii), $3million for category(iii) and $3million for category(iv) as of December31, 2004.
81 Categories (i)and (ii)have generally been adversely affected by overall economic conditions including interest rate changes and the market's evaluation of certain sectors. The degree to which and/or length of time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position does not suggest that these securities pose a high risk of being other than temporarily impaired. Categories (iii)and (iv)have primarily been adversely affected by industry and issue specific conditions. All of the securities in these categories are monitored for impairment. We expect that the fair values of these securities will recover over time.
Whenever our initial analysis indicates that a fixed income security's unrealized loss of 20% or more for at least 36months or any equity security's unrealized loss of 20% or more for at least 12months is temporary, additional evaluations and management approvals are required to substantiate that a write-down is not appropriate. As of December31, 2004, no securities met these criteria.
The following table contains the individual securities with the largest unrealized losses as of December31, 2004. No other fixed income or equity security had an unrealized loss greater than $2million or 1.0% of the total unrealized loss on fixed income and equity securities.

Problem fixed income securities are securities in default with respect to principal or interest and/or securities issued by companies that have gone into bankruptcy subsequent to our acquisition of the security. Restructured fixed income securities have rates and terms that are not consistent with market rates or terms prevailing at the time of the restructuring. Potential problem fixed income securities are current with respect to contractual principal and/or interest, but because of other facts and circumstances, we have concerns regarding the borrower's ability to pay future principal and interest, which causes us to believe these securities may be classified as problem or restructured in the future.
82 The following table summarizes problem, restructured and potential problem fixed income securities at December31.
2004 2003 (in millions) Amortized cost Fair value Percent of totalFixed Income portfolio Amortized cost Fair value Percent of totalFixed Income portfolio Problem $ 150 $ 153 0.1 % $ 325 $ 322 0.4 % Restructured 75 75 0.1 77 78 0.1 Potential problem 265 269 0.3 397 382 0.4 Total net carrying value $ 490 $ 497 0.5 % $ 799 $ 782 0.9 % Cumulative write-downs recognized $ 351 $ 347 We have experienced a decrease in the amortized cost of fixed income securities in all categories as of December31, 2004 compared to December31, 2003. The decreases were primarily related to prepayments by issuers, sales in these categories due to specific developments causing a change in our outlook and intent to hold those securities, and an improvement in the outlook for these securities.
We also evaluated each of these securities through our portfolio monitoring process at December31, 2004 and recorded write-downs when appropriate. We further concluded that any remaining unrealized losses on these securities were temporary in nature. While these balances may increase in the future, particularly if economic conditions are unfavorable, management expects that the total amount of securities in these categories will remain low relative to the total fixed income securities portfolio.
Net Realized Capital Gains and Losses The following table presents the components of realized capital gains and losses and the related tax effect for the years ended December31.
(in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Investment write-downs $ (129 ) $ (294 ) $ (467 ) Dispositions (1) 828 453 (221 ) Valuation of derivative instruments (46 ) 16 (60 ) Settlement of derivative instruments (62 ) 21 (176 ) Realized capital gains and losses, pretax 591 196 (924 ) Income tax (expense) benefit (199 ) (62 ) 326 Realized capital gains and losses, after-tax $ 392 $ 134 $ (598 ) (1) Gains from dispositions during 2004 include $90million of net capital gains from a repositioning of the equity portfolio and $49million of net capital gains from the liquidation of the Allstate Floridian Insurance Company portfolio in anticipation of liquidity needs to settle hurricane catastrophe claims.
Investment write-downs during 2004 represented approximately 0.1% of the average total investment portfolio value during the year. Included in losses from written down investments were $29million related to airline industry holdings. For the year ended December31, 2004, the $828million in net gains from sales was comprised of gross gains of $1.26billion and gross losses of $434million. Gross losses from sales of fixed income and equity securities combined with investment write-downs on fixed income and equity securities of $128million, represented total gross realized losses of $562million. Of the $434million in gross losses from sales of fixed income and equity securities, $228million resulted from sales of fixed income securities and $206million resulted from sales of equity securities.
83 Dispositions in the above table include sales and other transactions such as calls and prepayments. We may sell securities during the period in which fair value has declined below amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities. In certain situations new factors such as negative developments, subsequent credit deterioration, relative value opportunities, market liquidity concerns and portfolio reallocations can subsequently change our previous intent to continue holding a security.
A changing interest rate environment will also drive changes in our portfolio duration targets at a tactical level. A duration target and range is established with an economic view of liabilities relative to a long-term portfolio view. Tactical duration adjustments within management's approved ranges are accomplished through both cash market transactions and derivative activities that generate realized gains and losses. As a component of our approach to managing portfolio duration, realized gains and losses on futures are most appropriately considered in conjunction with the unrealized gains and losses on the Property-Liability fixed income portfolio. This approach mitigates the impacts of general interest rate changes to the overall financial condition of the corporation.
The ten largest losses from sales of individual securities for the year ended December31, 2004 totaled $73million with the largest being $16million and the smallest being $4million. None of the $73million related to securities that were in an unrealized loss position greater than or equal to 20% of amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities for a period of six or more consecutive months prior to sale.
Our largest aggregate loss on sales and writedowns are shown in the following table by issuer and its affiliates. No other issuer together with its affiliates had an aggregated loss on sales and writedowns greater than 2.0% of the total gross loss on sales and writedowns on fixed income and equity securities.
84 We have also included in this table the related circumstances giving rise to the losses and a discussion of how those circumstances may have affected other material investments held.
(in millions) Fair Value at Sale ("Proceeds") Loss on Sale Write- downs December31, 2004 Holdings (1) Net Unrealized Gain(Loss) A leading producer of graphics chips for personal computers and servers. A slowdown in demand for semiconductors and a delayed rollout of new products resulted in earnings falling significantly short of expectations. The position was liquidated at a loss.
$ 15 $ (16 ) $  $  $  A pharmaceutical company dealing with a lean drug pipeline, litigation risk, and political risk. We expect improvement in the company's operating environment. Sales were made in conjunction with the repositioning of our equity portfolio.
18 (9 ) (7 ) 58 4 An international vehicle manufacturer that filed for insolvency in early 2004.
(14 ) 6  A major U.S. airline. A write down was taken in the third quarter of 2004 reflecting a heightened probability of bankruptcy. Subsequently, the airline reached an agreement with its pilots and restructured certain near-term debt maturities through exchange offers. Current holdings are secured by specific aircraft. Valuations in the industry continue to be under stress.
1  (12 ) 21  A foreign company with operations related to infrastructure projects, including rail renewal and road design and construction.
(12 ) 17  A leading developer of software products used in the design and manufacturing of semiconductor devices. The combination of a faltering business cycle and less than expected product renewals caused results to fall significantly short of expectations. The position was liquidated at a loss.
16 (12 )  2  Total $ 50 $ (37 ) $ (45 ) $ 104 $ 4 (1) Holdings include fixed income securities at amortized cost or equity securities at cost.
The circumstances of the above losses are considered to be company specific and are not expected to have an effect on other holdings in our portfolios.
Mortgage Loans Our mortgage loans portfolio which is primarily held in the Allstate Financial portfolio was $7.86billion at December31, 2004 and $6.54billion at December31, 2003, and comprised primarily of loans secured by first mortgages on developed commercial real estate. Geographical and property type diversification are key considerations used to manage our mortgage loan risk.
85 We closely monitor our commercial mortgage loan portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis. Loans with an estimated collateral value less than the loan balance, as well as loans with other characteristics indicative of higher than normal credit risk, are reviewed by financial and investment management at least quarterly for purposes of establishing valuation allowances and placing loans on non-accrual status. The underlying collateral values are based upon either discounted property cash flow projections or a commonly used valuation method that utilizes a one-year projection of expected annual income divided by an expected rate of return. We had net realized capital losses related to write-downs on mortgage loans of $1million, $4million and $2million for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Short-Term Investments Our short-term investment portfolio was $4.13billion and $1.82billion at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We invest available cash balances primarily in taxable short-term securities having a final maturity date or redemption date of less than one year.
We also participate in securities lending, primarily as an investment yield enhancement, with third parties such as brokerage firms. We obtain collateral in an amount equal to 102% and 105% of the fair value of domestic and foreign securities, respectively, and monitor the market value of the securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary. The cash we receive is invested in short-term and fixed income investments, and an offsetting liability is recorded in other liabilities. At December31, 2004, the amount of securities lending collateral reinvested in short-term investments had a carrying value of $1.43billion. This compares to $569million at December31, 2003.
MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity, interest, commodity, or currency exchange rates and prices. Our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices, although we also have a smaller exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The active management of market risk is integral to our results of operations. We may use the following approaches to manage exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges: 1)rebalancing existing asset or liability portfolios, 2)changing the character of investments purchased in the future and 3)using derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or assets expected to be purchased. For a more detailed discussion of our use of derivative financial instruments, see Note6 of the consolidated financial statements.
Overview We generate substantial investable funds from our Property-Liability and Allstate Financial businesses. In formulating and implementing guidelines for investing funds, we seek to earn returns that enhance our ability to offer competitive rates and prices to customers while contributing to attractive and stable profits and long-term capital growth. Accordingly, our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each business.
Investment policies define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks, including accountability and control over risk management activities. Subsidiaries that conduct investment activities follow policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors. These investment policies specify the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given the liquidity, surplus, product profile and regulatory requirements of the subsidiary. These activities are conducted primarily through subsidiaries' boards of directors and investment committees. For Allstate Financial, the asset-liability management ("ALM") policy guidelines further define the overall asset-liability framework for managing market and investment risks. The Allstate Financial ALM activities follow asset-liability policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors. These ALM policies specify 86 limits, ranges and targets for investments that best meet Allstate Financial's business objectives in light of its product liabilities.
We manage our exposure to market risk through the use of asset allocation, duration and value-at-risk limits, through the use of simulation and, as appropriate, through the use of stress tests. We have asset allocation limits that place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class. We have duration limits on the Property-Liability and Allstate Financial investment portfolios and, as appropriate, on individual components of these portfolios. These duration limits place restrictions on the amount of interest rate risk that may be taken. Our value-at-risk limits restrict the potential loss in fair value that could arise from adverse movements in the fixed income, equity, and currency markets based on historical volatilities and correlations among market risk factors. Comprehensive day-to-day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by investment policies. For Allstate Financial, this day-to-day management is integrated within the day-to-day activities of the ALM function. One result of this work is the development and implementation of an asset allocation strategy for optimizing Allstate Financial's investment income.
Although we apply a common overall philosophy to market risk, the underlying business frameworks and the accounting and regulatory environments differ considerably between the Property-Liability and Allstate Financial businesses affecting investment decisions and risk parameters.
Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in interest rates. This risk arises from many of our primary activities, as we invest substantial funds in interest-sensitive assets and issue interest-sensitive liabilities, primarily in our Allstate Financial operations.
We manage the interest rate risk in our assets relative to the interest rate risk in our liabilities. One of the measures used to quantify this exposure is duration. Duration measures the price sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. For example, if interest rates increase 100 basis points, the fair value of an asset exhibiting a duration of 5 is expected to decrease in value by approximately 5%. At December31, 2004, the difference between our asset and liability duration was approximately 0.84, compared to a 0.99 gap at December31, 2003. A positive duration gap indicates that the fair value of our assets is more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our liabilities.
Most of our duration gap originates from the Property-Liability operations, with the primary liabilities being auto and homeowners claims. In the management of investments supporting the Property-Liability business, we adhere to an objective of emphasizing safety of principal and consistency of income within a total return framework. This approach is designed to ensure our financial strength and stability for paying claims, while maximizing economic value and surplus growth. This objective generally results in a positive duration mismatch between the Property-Liability assets and liabilities.
For the Allstate Financial business, we seek to invest premiums, contract charges and deposits to generate future cash flows that will fund future claims, benefits and expenses, and that will earn stable margins across a wide variety of interest rate and economic scenarios. In order to achieve this objective and limit interest rate risk for Allstate Financial, we adhere to a philosophy of managing the duration of assets and related liabilities. This philosophy may include using interest rate swaps, futures, forwards, caps and floors to reduce the interest rate risk resulting from mismatches between existing assets and liabilities, and financial futures and other derivative instruments to hedge the interest rate risk of anticipated purchases and sales of investments and product sales to customers.
We pledge and receive collateral on certain types of derivative contracts. For futures and option contracts traded on exchanges, we have pledged securities as margin deposits totaling $27million as of December31, 2004. For over-the-counter derivative transactions involving interest rate swaps, foreign 87 currency swaps, interest rate caps, interest rate floor agreements, and credit default swaps, master netting agreements are used. These agreements allow us to net payments due for transactions covered by the agreements, and when applicable, we are required to post collateral. As of December31, 2004,we had posted $1million of securities, while counterparties pledged $490million of cash as collateral for over-the-counter instruments.
To calculate the duration gap between assets and liabilities, we project asset and liability cash flows and calculate their net present value using a risk-free market interest rate adjusted for credit quality, sector attributes, liquidity and other specific risks. Duration is calculated by revaluing these cash flows at alternative interest rates and determining the percentage change in aggregate fair value. The cash flows used in this calculation include the expected maturity and repricing characteristics of our derivative financial instruments, all other financial instruments (as described in Note6 of the consolidated financial statements), and certain other items including unearned premiums, property-liability claims and claims expense reserves, interest-sensitive liabilities and annuity liabilities. The projections include assumptions (based upon historical market experience and our experience) that reflect the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment, lapse, leverage and/or option features of instruments, where applicable. Such assumptions relate primarily to mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, municipal housing bonds, callable municipal and corporate obligations, and fixed rate single and flexible premium deferred annuities. Additionally, the calculations include assumptions regarding the renewal of property-liability policies.
Based upon the information and assumptions we use in this duration calculation, and interest rates in effect at December31, 2004, we estimate that a 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase in interest rates ("rate shock") would decrease the net fair value of the assets and liabilities by approximately $1.79billion, compared to $1.77billion at December31, 2003. Additionally, there are $7.32billion of assets supporting life insurance products such as traditional and interest-sensitive life that are not financial instruments and as a result have not been included in the above estimate. This amount has increased from the $6.20billion reported at December31, 2003 due to increases in policies in force. Based on assumptions described above, in the event of a 100 basis point immediate increase in interest rates, these assets would decrease in value by $427million, compared to a decrease of $278million at December31, 2003. Also reflected in the duration calculation are the effects of a program that uses short futures to manage the Property-Liability interest rate risk exposures relative to duration targets. Based on contracts in place at December31, 2004, we would recognize realized capital gains totaling $45million in the event of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel interest rate increase and $45million in realized capital losses in the event of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel interest rate decrease. The selection of a 100 basis point immediate parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event.
To the extent that conditions differ from the assumptions we used in these calculations, duration and rate shock measures could be significantly impacted. Additionally, our calculations assume that the current relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates (the term structure of interest rates) will remain constant over time. As a result, these calculations may not fully capture the effect of non-parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates and/or large changes in interest rates.
Equity price risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in the general levels of the equity markets. At December31, 2004, we held approximately $4.88billion in common stocks and $1.82billion in other securities with equity risk (including primarily convertible securities, limited partnership funds and non-redeemable preferred securities), compared to approximately $4.42billion in common stocks and $1.30billion in other equity investments at December31, 2003. Approximately 99.8% 88 and 65.8% of these totals, respectively, represented assets of the Property-Liability operations at December31, 2004, compared to approximately 99.0% and 58.8%, respectively, at December31, 2003.
At December31, 2004, our portfolio of equity investments had a beta of approximately 0.85, compared to a beta of approximately 0.84 at December31, 2003. Beta represents a widely used methodology to describe, quantitatively, an investment's market risk characteristics relative to the Standard& Poor's 500 Composite Price Index ("S&P 500"). Based on the beta analysis, we estimate that if the S&P 500 decreases by 10%, the fair value of our equity investments will decrease by approximately 8.5%. Likewise, we estimate that if the S&P 500 increases by 10%, the fair value of our equity investments will increase by approximately 8.5%. Based upon the information and assumptions we used to calculate beta at December31, 2004, we estimate that an immediate decrease in the S&P 500 of 10% would decrease the net fair value of our equity investments identified above by approximately $569million, compared to $478million at December31, 2003. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease in the S&P 500 should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event.
The beta of our equity investments was determined by comparing the monthly total returns of the equity investments to monthly total returns of the S&P 500 over a three-year historical period. Since beta is historically based, projecting future price volatility using this method involves an inherent assumption that historical volatility and correlation relationships between stocks will not change in the future. Therefore, the illustrations noted above may not reflect our actual experience if future volatility and correlation relationships differ from the historical relationships.
At December31, 2004 and 2003, we had separate accounts assets related to variable annuity and variable life contracts with account values totaling $14.38billion and $13.43billion, respectively. We earn contract charges as a percentage of these account values. In the event of an immediate decline of 10% in the account values due to equity market declines, we would have earned approximately $24million and $21million less in fee income at December31, 2004 and December31, 2003, respectively.
Variable annuity contracts sold by Allstate Financial have a GMDB and customers may choose to purchase an enhanced GMDB, guaranteed minimum income benefits ("GMIB") prior to 2004, a TrueReturn SM guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit ("GMAB") beginning in 2004, and beginning in 2005, a SureIncome SM guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ("GMWB"). These guarantees subject us to additional equity market risk because the beneficiary or contractholder may receive a benefit that is greater than their corresponding account value. GMDBs are payable upon death. GMIBs may be exercised on or after the tenth-year anniversary (not prior to 2008) of the contract if the contractholder elects to receive a defined stream of payments ("annuitize"). GMABs are credited to the contractholder account on a contract anniversary date that is pre-determined by the contractholder, between the eighth and twentieth year after contract issue (not prior to 2012). GMABs guarantee an account value of up to 2.5 times (or 250%) of the amount deposited in the contract, depending on the amount of time the contract is in force and adherence to certain fund allocation requirements. GMWBs will be payable if the contractholder elects to take partial withdrawals. GMWBs guarantee that the contractholder can take annual partial withdrawals up to 8% of the amount deposited in the contract until their withdrawals total the initial deposit.
In January2004, we established reserves for GMDBs and GMIBs in conjunction with the adoption of SOP 03-1. Because of this change in accounting, guarantee payments will be recognized overfuture periods rather than expensed as paid. For more details see Notes 2 and 8 of the consolidated financial statements.
89 At December31, 2004 and 2003, the guaranteed value of the death benefits in excess of account values was estimated to be $1.80billion and $2.46billion, respectively, net of reinsurance. The decrease in this estimate between periods is attributable to improved equity markets during 2004 and customer surrenders of contracts with in-the-money GMDBs. In both periods, approximately two-thirds of this exposure is related to the return of deposits guarantee, while the remaining one-third is attributable to a death benefit guarantee greater than the original deposits. In addition to reinsurance for a portion of these benefits, we entered into various derivative instruments beginning in 2003 to offset the risk of future death claims on substantially all new business issued on or after January1, 2003. A similar program for GMABs was established in 2004 and a similar program for GMWBs will be established in 2005.
In the event of an immediate decline in account values of 10% due to equity market declines, payments for guaranteed death benefits at December31, 2004 would increase by an estimated $15million in 2005. These payments would be charged against the related reserve rather than directly to earnings as paid. Contributions to the reserve for GMDBs would be reduced by approximately $1million in 2005 in the event of an immediate 10% decline in account values. For discussion of the accounting treatment, see Note2 of the consolidated financial statements. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an example to illustrate the potential effect on earnings and cash flow of equity market declines as a result of this guarantee. Also, our actual payment experience in the future may not be consistent with the assumptions used in the model.
GMIB contracts that we sold provide the contractholder with the right to annuitize based on the highest account value at any anniversary date or on a guaranteed earnings rate based on the initial account value over the specified period. The guaranteed income benefit feature was first offered in our variably annuity products beginning in 1998, with guaranteed benefits available for election by contractholders ten years after issue. Accordingly, the earliest date at which benefits would become payable is 2008. In the event of an immediate decline of 10% in contractholders' account values as of December31, 2004 due to equity market declines, contributions to the reserve would be reduced by a nominal amount in 2005. For discussion of the accounting treatment, see Note2 of the consolidated financial statements. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an example to illustrate the potential effect on earnings and cash flow of equity market declines as a result of this guarantee.
In the event of an immediate decline of 10% in GMAB contractholders' account values as of December31, 2004, due to equity market declines, there would be no net impact on our earnings because these benefits are fully hedged, however the reserve for GMABs would be increased by approximately $5million.
In addition to our GMDB, GMIB and GMAB equity risk, at December31, 2004 and 2003 we had approximately $2.02billion and $1.55billion, respectively, in equity-indexed annuity liabilities that provide customers with interest crediting rates based on the performance of the S&P 500. We hedge the equity risk associated with these liabilities through the purchase and sale of equity-indexed options and futures, swap futures, and eurodollar futures, maintaining risk within specified value-at-risk limits.
Allstate Financial also is exposed to equity risk in DAC. Fluctuations in the value of the variable annuity and life contract account values due to the equity market affect DAC amortization, because the expected fee income and guaranteed benefits payable are components of the EGP for variable annuity and life contracts. For a more detailed discussion of DAC, see Note2 of the consolidated financial statements and the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A.
90 Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This risk primarily arises from our foreign equity investments, including real estate funds and our Canadian operations. We also have funding agreement programs and a small amount of fixed income securities that are denominated in foreign currencies, but we use derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk of these funding agreements and securities. At December31, 2004 and 2003, we had approximately $1.22billion and $1.36billion, respectively, in funding agreements denominated in foreign currencies.
At December31, 2004, we had approximately $455million in foreign currency denominated equity securities and an additional $567million net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries. These amounts were $380million and $492million, respectively, at December31, 2003. The foreign currency exposure is almost entirely in the Property-Liability business.
Based upon the information and assumptions we used at December31, 2004, we estimate that a 10% immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would decrease the value of our foreign currency denominated instruments by approximately $102million, compared with an estimated $87million decrease at December31, 2003. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event. Our currency exposure is diversified across 32 countries, compared to 31 countries at December31, 2003. Our largest individual currency exchange exposures at December31, 2004 were to the Canadian dollar (56.5%) and the British pound (11.0%). The largest individual currency exchange exposures at December31, 2003 were to the Canadian dollar (58.9%) and the British pound (10.5%). Our primary regional exposure is to Western Europe, approximately 28.7% at December31, 2004, compared to 27.8% at December31, 2003.
The modeling technique we use to report our currency exposure does not take into account correlation among foreign currency exchange rates. Even though we believe it is very unlikely that all of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would simultaneously decrease by 10%, we nonetheless stress test our portfolio under this and other hypothetical extreme adverse market scenarios. Our actual experience may differ from these results because of assumptions we have used or because significant liquidity and market events could occur that we did not foresee.
PENSION PLANS We have defined benefit pension plans, which cover most full-time and certain part-time employees and employee-agents. See Note16 of the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of these plans and their effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Net periodic pension cost in 2005 is estimated to be $313million based on current assumptions. Net periodic pension cost increased in 2004 and 2003 principally due to unfavorable returns on plan assets, decreases in the weighted average discount rate assumption which is based on long-term interest rates, and, in 2003, a decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In each of the years 2004, 2003 and 2002, net pension cost included non-cash settlement charges primarily resulting from lump sum distributions made to agents. Settlement charges are expected to continue in the future as we settle our remaining agent pension obligations by making lump sum distributions to agents.
As provided for in Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No.87 "Employers' Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits," the market-related value component of expected returns recognizes plan equity losses and gains over a five-year period, which we believe is consistent with the long-term nature of pension 91 obligations. As a result, the effect of changes in fair value on our net periodic pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur.
Amounts recorded for pension cost and minimum pension liabilities are significantly affected by fluctuations in the returns on plan assets and the amortization of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses. Plan assets sustained net losses in 2002 primarily due to the decline in the equity markets. These asset losses, combined with all other unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, resulted in amortization of net actuarial loss (and additional net periodic pension cost) of $121million in 2004 and $92million in 2003. We anticipate that the unrealized loss for our pension plans will exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligations or the market-related value of assets during the foreseeable future, resulting in additional amortization and net periodic pension cost.
Amounts recorded for net periodic pension cost and minimum pension liabilities are also significantly affected by changes in the assumptions used to determine the weighted average discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The weighted average discount rate is based on rates at which expected pension benefits attributable to past employee service could effectively be settled on a present value basis at the measurement date. We develop the assumed weighted average discount rate by utilizing the weighted average yield of a theoretical dedicated portfolio derived from bonds available in the Lehman corporate bond universe having ratings of at least "AA" by Standard& Poor's or at least "Aa" by Moody's on the measurement date with cash flows that match expected plan benefit requirements. Significant changes in discount rates, such as those caused by changes in the yield curve, the mix of bonds available in the market, the duration of selected bonds and expected benefit payments, may result in volatility in pension cost and minimum pension liabilities.
Holding other assumptions constant, a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the weighted average discount rate would result in an increase of $50million in net periodic pension cost and an $867million increase in the minimum pension liability after-tax as of October31, 2004, our most recent measurement date, versus an increase of $48million in net periodic pension cost and a $762million increase in the minimum pension liability after-tax as of October31, 2003. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the weighted average discount rate would decrease net periodic pension cost by $41million and would decrease the minimum pension liability after-tax by $49million as of October31, 2004, versus a decrease in net periodic pension cost of $40million and a $52million decrease in the minimum pension liability after-tax as of October31, 2003. This non-symmetrical range results from the non-linear relationship between discount rates and pension obligations, and changes in the amortization of unrealized net actuarial gains and losses.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets. While this rate reflects long-term assumptions and is consistent with long-term historical returns, sustained changes in the market or changes in the mix of plan assets may lead to revisions in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets that may result in variability of pension cost. Differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are a component of unrecognized gains or losses, which may be amortized as a component of net actuarial gains and losses. As a result, the effect of changes in fair value on our pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur.
Holding other assumptions constant, a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in an increase of $37million in pension cost at October31, 2004, compared to an increase of $34million at October31, 2003. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease in net periodic pension cost of $37million at October31, 2004, compared to a decrease of $34million at 92 October31, 2003. Changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets do not affect the minimum pension liability.
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Capital Resources consist of shareholders' equity and debt, representing funds deployed or available to be deployed to support business operations or for general corporate purposes. The following table summarizes our capital resources at December31.
(in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Common stock, retained earnings and other shareholders' equity items $ 19,208 $ 17,809 $ 15,705 Accumulated other comprehensive income 2,615 2,756 1,733 Total shareholders' equity 21,823 20,565 17,438 Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities   200 Debt 5,334 5,076 4,240 Total capital resources $ 27,157 $ 25,641 $ 21,878 Ratio of debt and mandatorily redeemable preferred securities to shareholders' equity 24.4 % 24.7 % 25.5 % Shareholders' equity increased in 2004 when compared to 2003, as net income was partially offset by share repurchases and dividends paid to shareholders. Shareholders' equity increased in 2003 when compared to 2002, as net income, unrealized net capital gains on investments and a decrease in the minimum pension liability were partially offset by dividends paid to shareholders and share repurchases. Our $1.50billion share repurchase program was completed as of December31, 2004. Commencing in January2005, we have a new $4.00billion share repurchase program which is expected to be completed in 2006.
Treasury stock is a component of shareholders' equity and, since 1995, we have repurchased 292million shares of our common stock at a cost of $9.90billion, primarily as part of various stock repurchase programs. We have reissued 76million shares since 1995, primarily associated with our equity incentive plans, the 1999 acquisition of American Heritage Life Investment Corporation ("AHL") and the redemption of certain mandatorily redeemable preferred securities.
Debt increased in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to increases in long-term borrowings outstanding. We issued $650million of 5.00% Senior Notes due in 2014, utilizing the registration statement filed with the SEC in June2000. The proceeds of this issuance will be used for general corporate purposes, including to facilitate the repayment of a portion of the $900million of 7 7 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2005 at their scheduled maturity on May1, 2005. We anticipate having adequate sources of liquidity from existing investments and dividends from subsidiaries to repay the remaining portion of the $900million of 7 7 / 8 % Senior Notes. The increase in debt was partially offset by a decrease of $412million related to the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity ("VIE") resulting from the sale of a portion of the equity interest in the VIE. For more information on the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No.46 ("FIN 46"), see Notes 2, 3 and 11 of the consolidated financial statements.
At December31, 2004, we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $43million with a weighted average interest rate of 2.22%.
93 The increase in debt in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to the adoption of FIN 46 and increases in long-term borrowings outstanding, partly offset by declines in short-term borrowings outstanding. The adoption of FIN 46, effective July1, 2003, increased long-term debt by $1.05billion, including $691million for the consolidation of two VIEs to hold assets under the management of an affiliate on behalf of third-party investors, $112million for the consolidation of a VIE for a headquarters office building and up to 38 automotive collision repair stores, $45million for the consolidation of the debt of a previously unconsolidated investment security, and $200million of the debt we issued to Allstate Financing II ("AF II") that is no longer required to be consolidated. Although we were required to consolidate the two VIEs used to hold assets on behalf of third-party investors under FIN 46, we had no legal ownership of the assets and no obligation to repay the debt. Our maximum exposure related to these two entities was the current value of our equity investment, which totaled $12million at December31, 2003. Moody's and Standard and Poor's had apprised us that the reported debt associated with the consolidation of these VIEs would be excluded for analytical purposes from the ratio of debt to shareholders' equity for ratings considerations. This analytical ratio was 21.3% as of December31, 2003.
In 2003, we issued $400million of 5.350% Senior Notes due in 2033, utilizing the registration statement filed with the SEC in 2000. The proceeds of this issuance were used to redeem the $300million of 6 3 / 4 % Notes due 2003 and for general corporate purposes.
Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities were eliminated as a separate line item on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position effective July1, 2003, because of the adoption of FIN 46. This accounting guidance required the de-consolidation of AF II, a subsidiary that we own 100%, and the recognition of debt pursuant to debentures that we had previously issued to AF II, which are held as collateral for the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. For further discussion of the capital structure of AF II, see Note11 of the consolidated financial statements.
Financial Ratings and Strength The following table summarizes our debt, commercial paper and insurance financial strength ratings at December31, 2004.
Moody's Standard & Poor's A.M. Best The Allstate Corporation (senior long-term debt) A1 A+ a The Allstate Corporation (commercial paper) P-1 A-1 AMB-1 Allstate Insurance Company (financial strength) Aa2 AA A+ Allstate Life Insurance Company ("ALIC") (financial strength) Aa2 AA A+ Our ratings are influenced by many factors including our operating and financial performance, asset quality, liquidity, asset/liability management, overall portfolio mix, financial leverage (i.e., debt), exposure to risks such as catastrophes and the current level of operating leverage. We have distinct groups of subsidiaries licensed to sell property and casualty insurance in New Jersey and Florida. These groups have separate group ratings and are not reinsured by other Allstate subsidiaries that are not part of each of these respective groups. The ratings of the New Jersey and Florida groups are influenced by the risks noted above as they relate distinctly to each group. In 2004,A.M. Best revised the rating of Allstate Floridian Insurance Company ("Allstate Floridian") and Allstate Floridian Indemnity Company from A- (Excellent) to B+ (Very Good). These ratings remain under review with negative implications as the current risk-adjusted capitalization is not supportive of the rating, as a result of a decline in capital of Allstate Floridian due to hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne. The resolution of the ratings review will be influenced by developments prior to the 2005 hurricane season, including Florida regulatory and legislative actions, Allstate and Allstate Floridian management actions,A.M. Best's assessment of the timing and nature of such developments and their view on the amount of capital and risk-adjusted 94 capitalization deemed necessary to support the ratings. Although at present it is not clear when a ratings decision will be made, it is believedA.M. Best will make a ratings decision before the 2005 hurricane season.A.M. Best has indicated it is evaluating its methodology for determining the level of capital needed to support property insurance written in areas of hurricane loss exposure in Florida. Allstate Floridian also has a Demotech rating of A1.
The ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus is a common measure of operating leverage used in the property-casualty insurance industry and serves as an indicator of a company's premium growth capacity. Ratios in excess of 3 to 1 are typically considered outside the usual range by insurance regulators and rating agencies. AIC's premium to surplus ratio was 1.5x on December31, 2004 compared to 1.5x in the prior year.
State laws specify regulatory actions if an insurer's risk-based capital ("RBC"), a measure of an insurer's solvency, falls below certain levels. The NAIC has a standard formula for annually assessing RBC. The formula for calculating RBC for property-liability companies takes into account asset and credit risks but places more emphasis on underwriting factors for reserving and pricing. The formula for calculating RBC for life insurance companies takes into account factors relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks. At December31, 2004, the RBC for each of our domestic insurance companies was above levels that would require regulatory actions.
The NAIC has also developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or actions by insurance regulatory authorities. The NAIC analyzes financial data provided by insurance companies using prescribed ratios, each with defined "usual ranges". Generally, regulators will begin to monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios. If an insurance company has insufficient capital, regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue. The ratios of our domestic insurance companies are within these ranges.

Property-Liability Allstate Financial Corporate and Other Consolidated (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 4,092 $ 3,450 $ 2,543 $ 1,916 $ 2,256 $ 1,887 $ (540 ) $ (15 ) $ (7 ) $ 5,468 $ 5,691 $ 4,423 Investing activities (1,903 ) (2,344 ) (1,613 ) (8,039 ) (6,769 ) (7,560 ) (781 ) (351 ) 165 (10,723 ) (9,464 ) (9,008 ) Financing activities 49 11 92 6,506 4,554 5,443 (1,252 ) (888 ) (751 ) 5,303 3,677 4,784 Net increase (decrease) in consolidated cash $ 48 $ (96 ) $ 199 Property-Liability Higher operating cash flows of the Property-Liability business in 2004 and 2003 were primarily due to increased underwriting income despite catastrophe losses in 2004 and contributions made to our defined benefit pension plans in 2004 and 2003. Cash used in investing activities decreased in 2004 primarily as a result of less underwriting income being available for investment due to higher operating cash flows offset by dividends paid by AIC to its parent. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2003 as higher operating cash flows were invested in the fixed income and equity portfolios.
Cash flows were impacted by dividends paid by AIC to its parent, The Allstate Corporation, totaling $2.49billion, $1.27billion and $675million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. For a description of limitations on the payment of these dividends, see Note15 of the consolidated financial statements.
Allstate Financial Lower cash flows from operating activities in 2004, compared to 2003, were primarily due to lower premium collections and higher deferrable expenses paid, partially offset by lower policy and contract benefits paid and higher interest received on fixed income securities and mortgage loans. The lower premium collections were primarily the result of the disposal of substantially all of our direct response distribution business and lower sales of life-contingent immediate annuities. Higher operating cash flows of Allstate Financial in 2003 primarily relate to increases in investment income, partially offset by an increase in benefits and acquisition related expenses from new business growth.
Cash flows used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared to 2003 as the investment of higher financing cash flows was partially offset by lower operating cash flow. Cash flows used in 96 investing activities declined in 2003 compared to 2002 as the investment of higher operating cash flows were offset by lower financing cash flow.
Increased cash flows from financing activities in 2004, compared to 2003, were primarily attributable to higher deposits of fixed annuities and institutional products, partially offset by fixed annuity withdrawals and institutional product maturities. Lower cash flow from financing activities during 2003 reflect an increase in maturities of institutional products and benefits and withdrawals from contractholders' accounts, partially offset by increased deposits received from contractholders. For quantification of the changes in contractholder funds, see the Allstate Financial Segment section of the MD&A.
A portion of the Allstate Financial product portfolio, primarily fixed annuity and interest-sensitive life insurance products, is subject to surrender and withdrawal at the discretion of contractholders. The following table summarizes Allstate Financial's liabilities for these products by their contractual withdrawal provisions at December31, 2004. Approximately 16.7% of these liabilities is subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustment.
(in millions) 2004 Not subject to discretionary withdrawal $ 15,074 Subject to discretionary withdrawal with adjustments: Specified surrender charges (1) 21,902 Market value (2) 9,453 Subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustments 9,280 Total Contractholder funds $ 55,709 (1) Includes $9.15billion of liabilities with a contractual surrender charge of less than 5.0% of the account balance.
(2) Approximately $8.14billion of the contracts with market value adjusted surrenders have a 30-45day period during which there is no surrender charge or market value adjustment, including approximately $1.45billion of market-value adjusted annuities with a period commencing during 2005.
To ensure we have the appropriate level of liquidity in this segment, we perform actuarial tests on the impact to cash flows of policy surrenders and other actions under various scenarios. Depending upon the years in which certain policy types were sold with specific surrender provisions, the Allstate Financial cash flow could vary due to higher surrender of policies exiting their surrender charge periods.
Corporate and Other Lower operating cash flow of the Corporate and Other segment in 2004 was primarily due to the timing of intercompany settlements. Financing cash flows of the Corporate and Other segment reflect actions such as fluctuations in short-term debt, proceeds from the issuance of debt, dividends to shareholders of The Allstate Corporation and share repurchases; therefore, financing cash flows are affected when we increase or decrease the level of these activities. Higher uses of cash in investing activities during 2004 and 2003 reflect additional net investments made in the portfolio of Kennett Capital, a subsidiary of The Allstate Corporation. Kennett Capital has $1.90billion of capital that is available to pay dividends to The Allstate Corporation, that are not subject to insurance company limitations.
We have established external sources of short-term liquidity that include a commercial paper program, lines-of-credit, dollar rolls and repurchase agreements. In the aggregate, at December31, 2004, these sources could provide over $3.16billion of additional liquidity. For additional liquidity, we can also issue new insurance contracts, incur additional debt and sell assets from our investment portfolio. The liquidity of our investment portfolio varies by type of investment. For example, $17.41billion of privately 97 placed corporate obligations that represent 15.1% of the investment portfolio, and $7.86billion of mortgage loans that represent 6.8% of the investment portfolio, generally are considered to be less liquid than many of our other types of investments, such as our U.S. government and agencies, municipal and public corporate fixed income security portfolios.
We have access to additional borrowing to support liquidity as follows:  A commercial paper program with a borrowing limit of $1.00billion to cover short-term cash needs. As of December31, 2004, the remaining borrowing capacity was $957million; however, the outstanding balance fluctuates daily.
We currently maintain one primary credit facility and one additional credit facility totaling $1.05billion to cover short-term liquidity requirements. The primary facility is a $1billion five-year revolving line of credit expiring in 2009. It contains an increase provision that would make up to an additional $500million available for borrowing provided the increased portion could be fully syndicated at a later date among existing or new lenders. The other facility is a $50million one-year revolving line of credit renewed in July2004 for an additional year. Although the right to borrow under the five-year facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement, the costs of maintaining the five-year facility and borrowing under it are based on the ratings of our senior, unsecured, nonguaranteed long-term debt. There were no borrowings under either of these lines of credit during 2004. The total amount outstanding at any point in time under the combination of the commercial paper program and the two credit facilities cannot exceed the amount that can be borrowed under the credit facilities.
The right to issue up to an additional $2.15billion of debt securities, equity securities, warrants for debt and equity securities, trust preferred securities, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units utilizing the shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in August2003.
Our only financial covenant exists with respect to our primary credit facility and $18million of our capital lease obligations. The covenant requires that we not exceed a 37.5% debt to capital resources ratio as defined in the agreements. This ratio at December31, 2004 was 19.9%.
We closely monitor and manage our liquidity through long- and short-term planning that is integrated between the corporation, the business segments and investments. Allstate Financial manages the duration of assets and related liabilities through ALM, using a dynamic process that addresses liquidity utilizing the investment portfolio, and components of the portfolio as appropriate, which is routinely subjected to stress testing. Allstate Protection's underwriting cash transactions comprise millions of small transactions that make it possible to statistically determine reasonable expectations of patterns of liquidity, which are subject to volatility from unpredictable catastrophe losses. Allstate Protection monitors the duration of its assets and liabilities and maintains a portfolio of highly liquid fixed income and equity securities, including short-term investments, exchange-traded common stock, municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and U.S. government and government agency securities in order to address the variability of its cash flows. Discontinued Lines and Coverages' liabilities are expected to be paid over many years and do not present a significant liquidity risk. Allstate Financial and Allstate Protection also have access to funds from our commercial paper program.
Certain remote events and circumstances could constrain our liquidity. Those events and circumstances include, for example, a catastrophe resulting in extraordinary losses, a downgrade in our long-term debt rating of A1 and A+ (from Moody's and Standard& Poor's, respectively) to non-investment grade status of below Baa3/BBB-, a downgrade in AIC's financial strength rating from Aa2, AA and A+ (from Moody's, Standard& Poor's andA.M. Best, respectively) to below Baa/BBB/A-, or a downgrade in ALIC's financial strength ratings from Aa2, AA and A+ (from Moody's, Standard& Poor's 98 andA.M. Best, respectively) to below Aa3/AA-/A-. The rating agencies also consider the interdependence of our individually rated entities, therefore, a rating change in one entity could potentially affect the ratings of other related entities.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our contractual obligations as of December31, 2004 and the payments due by period are shown in the following table.
(in millions) Total Less than 1year 1-3 years 4-5 years Over 5 years Securities lending, dollar rolls, and repurchase agreements (1) $ 4,364 $ 4,364 $  $  $  Commercial paper 43 43    Contractholder funds (2) 75,033 8,194 19,337 10,914 36,588 Reserve for life-contingent contract benefits (3) 28,208 927 2,773 1,852 22,656 Long-term debt (4) 5,293 900 706 750 2,937 Capital lease obligations (4) 34 2 4 4 24 Operating leases (4) 816 220 279 155 162 Unconditional purchase obligations (4) 495 233 231 31  Pension obligations (4)(5) 89 71 12 6  Reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense (6) 19,338 8,104 6,043 2,356 2,835 Other liabilities and accrued expenses (7)(8) 8,146 3,381 191 139 4,435 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 141,859 $ 26,439 $ 29,576 $ 16,207 $ 69,637 (1) Securities lending, dollar rolls and repurchase transactions are typically fully collateralized with marketable securities. We manage our short-term liquidity position to ensure the availability of a sufficient amount of liquid assets to extinguish short-term liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business.
(2) Contractholder funds represent interest-bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products such as interest-sensitive life, fixed annuities, including immediate annuities without life contingencies, bank deposits and institutional products. These amounts reflect estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and contractholders. Certain of these contracts, such as immediate annuities without life contingencies and institutional products, involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of the payment is essentially fixed and determinable. These amounts relate to (i)policies or contracts where we are currently making payments and will continue to do so and (ii)contracts where the timing of payments has been determined by the contract. Other contracts, such as interest-sensitive life and fixed deferred annuities, involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain. For these contracts and bank deposits, (i)the Company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death, or (ii)the occurrence of a payment triggering event, such as the surrender of or partial withdrawal on a policy or deposit contract, which is outside of the control of the Company. We have estimated the timing of payments related to these contracts based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns. Uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, customer lapse and withdrawal activity, and estimated additional deposits for interest-sensitive life contracts, which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments. Such cash outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated timing of mortality, retirement, and other appropriate factors, but are undiscounted with respect to interest. As a result, the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of $75.03billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of $55.71billion included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December31, 2004 for contractholder funds. The liability amount in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position reflects the discounting for interest as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above.
(3) The reserve for life-contingent contract benefits relates primarily to traditional life and immediate annuities with life contingencies and reflects the present value of estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and contractholders. Immediate annuities with life contingencies include (i)contracts where we are currently making payments and will continue to do so until the occurrence of a specific event such as death and (ii)contracts where the timing of a portion of the payments has been determined by the contract. Other contracts, such as traditional life and supplemental accident and health insurance, involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain. For these contracts, (i)the Company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or illness, or (ii)the occurrence of a payment triggering event, such as a surrender of a policy or contract, which is outside of the control of the Company. We have estimated the timing of cash outflows related to these contracts based on historical 99 experience and our expectation of future payment patterns. Uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, morbidity, expenses, customer lapse and withdrawal activity, and renewal premium for life policies, which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments. Such cash outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated timing of mortality, retirement, and other appropriate factors, but are undiscounted with respect to interest. As a result, the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of $28.21billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of $11.75billion included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December31, 2004 for reserve for life-contingent contract benefits. The liability amount in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position reflects the discounting for interest as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above.
(4) Our payment obligations relating to long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating leases, unconditional purchase obligations and pension obligations are managed within the structure of our intermediate to long-term liquidity management program.
(5) Pension obligations represent approved contributions to our pension plans.
(6) Reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. We have estimated the timing of these payments based on our historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns. However, the timing of these payments may vary significantly from the amounts shown above, especially for those claims that have been incurred but not reported. The reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense includes loss reserves related to asbestos and environmental claims as of December31, 2004, of $2.43billion and $281million, respectively.
(7) Other liabilities primarily include accrued expenses and certain benefit obligations and claim payments and other checks outstanding. Certain of these long-term liabilities are discounted with respect to interest, as a result the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of $8.15billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of $4.14billion.
(8) Balance sheet liabilities not included in the table above include unearned and advance premiums of $10.68billion and deferred income taxes of $829million. These items were excluded as they do not meet the definition of a contractual liability as we are not contractually obligated to pay these amounts to third parties. Rather, they represent an accounting mechanism that allows us to present our financial statements on an accrual basis of accounting. In addition, other liabilities of $1.08billion were not included in the table above because they did not represent a contractual obligation or the amount and timing of their eventual payment was sufficiently uncertain.
Our contractual commitments as of December31, 2004 and the payments due by period are shown in the following table.

We have agreements in place for services we conduct, generally at cost, between subsidiaries relating to insurance, reinsurance, loans and capitalization. All material inter-company transactions have appropriately been eliminated in consolidation. Inter-company transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate departments of insurance as required.
ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT Risk management is primarily employed within the business unit where the risk resides. In addition, we have a senior management advisory committee called the Enterprise Risk Council ("ERC"). Although the work of the ERC is in the early stages, ultimately it will be responsible for assessing risks on an integrated basis across subsidiaries and organizations.
Among the risks that the ERC will be assessing are catastrophe risk management techniques employed by Allstate Protection; asset/liability management techniques primarily employed by Allstate Financial; and investment risk, including market risk, credit/counterparty risk, liquidity risk, operating risk 100 and derivatives exposure limits employed by our Credit Risk Management Committee ("CRMC") in our investment organization. In addition to integrating these elements, other objectives of the ERC include:  Assessing/evaluating risk capacity impacting multiple organizations  Aligning risk appetites and strategy  Linking enterprise growth, risk, and return  Identifying enterprise risk opportunity sets  Rationalizing capital We are utilizing for Allstate Protection an internally developed stochastic model as a significant component in our determination of an appropriate level of economic capital needed, given a defined tolerance for risk. Economic capital modeling capabilities enable us to more fully understand and optimize risk/reward tradeoffs across the portfolio of businesses. The economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature and interaction of the risks inherent in our businesses, and also provides a basis upon which capital may be allocated to each business unit. Future plans include adding to the model similar economic capital evaluations with respect to the Allstate Financial business unit and our investment operations so that there is a total enterprise perspective.
REGULATION AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are subject to extensive regulation and we are involved in various legal and regulatory actions, all of which have an effect on specific aspects of our business. For a detailed discussion of the legal and regulatory actions in which we are involved, see Note13 of the consolidated financial statements.
PENDING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS As of December31, 2004, there are several pending and proposed accounting standards that we have not implemented either because the standard has not been finalized or the implementation date has not yet occurred. For a discussion of these pending and proposed standards, see Note2 of the consolidated financial statements.
The effect of implementing certain accounting standards on our financial results and financial condition is often based in part on market conditions at the time of implementation of the standard and other factors we are unable to determine prior to implementation. For this reason, we are sometimes unable to estimate the effect of certain pending accounting standards until the relevant authoritative body finalizes these standards or until we implement them.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS This document contains "forward-looking statements" that anticipate results based on our estimates, assumptions and plans that are subject to uncertainty. These statements are made subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments.
These forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may be identified by their use of words like "plans," "seeks," "expects," "will," "should," "anticipates," "estimates," "intends," "believes," "likely," "targets" and other words with similar meanings. These statements may address, among other things, our strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approvals, market position, expenses, financial results, litigation and reserves. We believe that these statements are based on reasonable estimates, assumptions and plans. However, if the estimates, assumptions or plans 101 underlying the forward-looking statements prove inaccurate or if other risks or uncertainties arise, actual results could differ materially from those communicated in these forward-looking statements. Factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by such forward-looking statements include but are not limited to those discussed or identified in this document (including the risks described below) and in our public filings with the SEC.
In addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those listed below, which apply to us as an insurer and a provider of other financial services.
Risks Relating to the Property-Liability business As a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events Because of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events, our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man-made disasters, including earthquakes, volcanoes, wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes, tropical storms and terrorism. While we believe that our natural event catastrophe management initiatives have reduced the potential magnitude of possible future natural event losses, we continue to be exposed to catastrophes that could have a material adverse effect on operating results and financial position. For example, in 2004 we incurred losses of $2.00billion, net of recoveries from the FHCF, in connection with a series of four hurricanes (Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne) that struck portions of Florida, the southeastern seaboard, and other parts of the United States. In addition, our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to Hurricane Andrew in 1992, totaling $2.3billion, and to the Northridge earthquake of 1994, totaling $2.1billion. We are also exposed to assessments from the California Earthquake Authority and various Florida state-created catastrophe loss management facilities, and to losses that could surpass the capitalization of these facilities. Our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings.
In addition, we are also subject to claims arising from weather events such as winter storms, rain, hail and high winds. The incidence and severity of weather conditions are inherently unpredictable. There is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of auto and homeowners claims when severe weather conditions occur.
Unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our profitability Changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect the profitability of our Allstate Protection segment. Changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy. Changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs, auto parts prices and used car prices. Changes in homeowner's claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry, in building materials and in home furnishings and by other economic and environmental factors. However, changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation in these various sectors of the economy. Increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict. Examples of such events include a decision in 2001 by the Georgia Supreme Court that diminished value coverage was included in auto policies under Georgia law, and the emergence of mold-related homeowners losses in the state of Texas. Although from time to time we pursue various loss management initiatives in the Allstate Protection segment in order to mitigate future increases in claim severity, there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity.
102 Our Allstate Protection segment has experienced a decline in claim frequency. The industry has experienced a similar decline. We believe that this decrease may be attributable to a combination of several factors, including an increase in the level of policy deductibles chosen by policyholders, a decrease in policyholder submission of claims for minor losses, and our implementation of improved underwriting criteria. The favorable level of claim frequency we have experienced may not be sustainable over the longer term. A significant increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
Actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims Recorded claim reserves in the Property-Liability business are based on our best estimates of losses, both reported and incurred but not reported, after considering known facts and circumstances, internal factors including our experience with similar losses, historical trends involving claim payment patterns, loss payments, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs and product mix. In addition, reserve estimates are influenced by external factors including changes in regulation, court decisions, economic conditions and public attitudes. Because reserves are estimates of losses that have occurred, including IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
Predicting claim expense relating to asbestos and other environmental and discontinued lines is inherently uncertain The process of estimating asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines liabilities is complicated by complex legal issues concerning, among other things, the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are, or were ever intended to be, covered; the ability of policyholders to file claims or add claimants to active claims; and whether losses could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Asbestos-related bankruptcies and other asbestos litigations are complex, lengthy proceedings that involve substantial uncertainty for insurers. While we believe that improved actuarial techniques and databases have assisted in estimating asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines net loss reserves, these refinements may subsequently prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable loss. Consequently, ultimate net losses from these discontinued lines could materially exceed established loss reserves and expected recoveries, and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, operating results and financial position.
Regulation limiting rate increases and requiring us to underwrite business and participate in loss sharing arrangements may decrease our profitability From time to time, political events and positions affect the insurance market, including efforts to suppress rates to a level that may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. Moreover, because Allstate Protection's loss ratio currently compares favorably to that of the industry, state regulatory authorities may resist or delay our efforts to raise rates in the future even if the property and casualty industry generally is not experiencing regulatory resistance to rate increases. Such resistance affects our ability in all product lines to obtain approval for rate changes that may be required to achieve targeted levels of profitability and returns on equity. Additionally, homeowners premium growth rates and retention could be adversely impacted by the need to adjust our business structure, size and underwriting practices in Florida and other markets with significant catastrophe risk exposure.
103 In addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a property-liability insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations or require the insurer to offer coverage to all consumers, often restricting an insurer's ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge. In these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates, possibly leading to an unacceptable return on capital. Laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer's ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Additionally, certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. These funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state. Our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors.
The potential benefits of implementing Tiered Pricing may not be fully realized We believe that Tiered Pricing and underwriting (including SRM which, in some situations, considers information that is obtained from credit reports among other factors) has allowed us to be more competitive and operate more profitably. However, because some of our competitors have adopted underwriting criteria and Tiered Pricing models similar to those we use and because other competitors may follow suit, we may lose our competitive advantage. Further, the use of insurance scoring from information that is obtained from credit reports as a factor in underwriting and pricing has at times been challenged by regulators, legislators, litigants and special interest groups in various states. Competitive pressures could also force us to modify our Tiered Pricing model. Furthermore, because we have been using Tiered Pricing only for the last several years, we cannot make assurances that Tiered Pricing models will accurately reflect the level of losses that we will ultimately incur from the mix of new business generated. Moreover, to the extent that competitive pressures limit our ability to attract new customers, our expectation that the amount of business written using Tiered Pricing will increase may not be realized.
Allstate Protection may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. A downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Risks Relating to the Allstate Financial Segment Changes in underwriting and actual experience could materially affect profitability Our product pricing includes long-term assumptions regarding investment returns, mortality, morbidity, persistency and operating costs and expenses of the business. Management establishes target returns for each product based upon these factors and the average amount of regulatory and rating agency capital that the company must hold to support in-force contracts. We monitor and manage our pricing and overall sales mix to achieve target returns on a portfolio basis. Profitability from new business emerges over a period of years depending on the nature and life of the product and is subject to variability as actual results may differ from pricing assumptions.
104 Our profitability in this segment depends on the adequacy of investment margins, the management of market and credit risks associated with investments, our ability to maintain premiums and contract charges at a level adequate to cover mortality and morbidity benefits, the adequacy of contract charges on variable contracts to cover the costs of various product features, the persistency of policies to ensure recovery of acquisition expenses, and the management of operating costs and expenses within anticipated pricing allowances. Legislation and regulation of the insurance marketplace and products could also affect our profitability.
Changes in reserve estimates may reduce profitability Reserve for life-contingent contract benefits is computed on the basis of long-term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields, mortality, morbidity, policy terminations and expenses. We periodically review the adequacy of these reserves on an aggregate basis and if future experience differs significantly from assumptions, adjustments to reserves may be required which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
Changes in market interest rates may lead to a significant decrease in the sales and profitability of spread-based products Our ability to manage the Allstate Financial investment margin for spread-based products is dependent upon maintaining profitable spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates. As interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, proceeds from investments that have matured, prepaid or sold may be reinvested at lower yields, reducing investment margin. Lowering interest crediting rates can offset decreases in investment margin on some products. However, these changes could be limited by market conditions, regulatory or contractual minimum rate guarantees on many contracts and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. Decreases in the rates offered on products in the financial segment could make those products less attractive, leading to lower sales and/or changes in the level of surrenders and withdrawals for these products. Increases in market interest rates can also have negative effects on Allstate Financial, for example by increasing the attractiveness of other investments, which can lead to higher surrenders at a time when the segment's investment asset values are lower as a result of the increase in interest rates. For certain products, principally fixed annuity and interest sensitive life products, the earned rate on assets could lag behind market yields. We may react to market conditions by increasing crediting rates, which could narrow spreads. Unanticipated surrenders could result in DAC unlocking or affect the recoverability of DAC and thereby increase expenses and reduce profitability.
Declining equity markets may reduce both sales of products and income from contract charges and may adversely affect operating results and financial condition Conditions in the United States and international stock markets affect the sale and profitability of Allstate Financial's variable annuities. In general, sales of variable annuities decrease when stock markets are declining over an extended period of time. The effect of decreasing separate accounts balances resulting from volatile equity markets, lower underlying fund performance or declining consumer confidence could cause contract charges earned to decrease. In addition, it is possible that the assumptions and projections we use to establish prices for GMDB, GMIB, GMAB and GMWB products, particularly assumptions and projections about investment performance, do not accurately reflect the level of costs that we will ultimately incur in providing those benefits, resulting in adverse margin trends. These factors may result in accelerated DAC amortization and require increases in reserves, which would reduce statutory capital and surplus and/or Allstate Financial's net income. Poor fund performance could also 105 result in higher partial withdrawals of account value which, for some contracts, do not reduce the GMDB by a proportional amount.
Changes in estimates of profitability on interest-sensitive and variable products may have an adverse effect on results through increased amortization of DAC DAC related to interest-sensitive life, variable life and annuity and investment contracts is amortized in proportion to EGP over the estimated lives of the contracts. Assumptions underlying EGP, including those relating to margins from mortality, investment margin, contract administration, surrender and other contract charges, are updated from time to time in order to reflect actual and expected experience and its potential effect on the valuation of DAC. Updates to these assumptions could result in DAC unlocking, which in turn could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
A loss of key product distribution relationships could materially affect sales Certain products in the Allstate Financial segment are distributed under agreements with other members of the financial services industry that are not affiliated with us. Termination of one or more of these agreements due to, for example, a change in control of one of these distributors, could have a detrimental effect on the sales of Allstate Financial.
Changes in tax laws may decrease sales and profitability of products Under current federal and state income tax law, certain products (primarily life insurance and annuities) we offer receive favorable tax treatment. This favorable treatment may give certain of our products a competitive advantage over noninsurance products. Congress from time to time considers legislation that would reduce or eliminate the favorable policyholder tax treatment currently applicable to life insurance and annuities. Congress also considers proposals to reduce the taxation of certain products or investments that may compete with life insurance and annuities. Legislation that increases the taxation on insurance products or reduces the taxation on competing products could lessen the advantage of certain of our products as compared to competing products. Such proposals, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or ability to sell such products and could result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies. In addition, changes in the federal estate tax laws have negatively affected the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate planning.
Risks Relating to the Insurance Industry Our future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive The insurance industry is highly competitive. Our competitors include other insurers and, because many of our products include a savings or investment component, securities firms, investment advisers, mutual funds, banks and other financial institutions. Many of our competitors have well-established national reputations and market similar insurance products. Because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry, including competition for producers such as exclusive and independent agents, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. The ability of banks to affiliate with insurers may have a material adverse effect on all of our product lines by substantially increasing the number, size and financial strength of potential competitors. Furthermore, certain competitors operate using a mutual insurance company structure and therefore, may have dissimilar profitability and return targets.
106 We are subject to market risk and so changing interest rates and declines in credit quality may have adverse effects Because we have large investment portfolios, we are subject to market risk, the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity, interest, commodity or foreign currency exchange rates and prices. Our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices and, to a lesser degree, changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For additional information on market risk, see the "Market Risk" section of MD&A.
A decline in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our investment income as we invest cash in new investments that may yield less than the portfolio's average rate. In a declining interest rate environment, borrowers may prepay or redeem securities we hold more quickly than expected as they seek to refinance at lower rates. A decline could also cause the purchase of longer-term assets in order to obtain adequate investment yields resulting in a duration gap when compared to the duration of liabilities. An increase in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial majority of our investment portfolio. Increases in interest rates also may lead to an increase in policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals that generally would be funded at a time when fair values of fixed income securities are lower. A decline in the quality of our investment portfolio as a result of adverse economic conditions or otherwise could cause additional realized losses on securities, including realized losses relating to derivative strategies not adequately addressing portfolio risks. A declining market could also cause the investments in our pension plans to decrease below the accumulated benefit obligation, resulting in additional pension liability and expense and increasing required contributions to the pension plans.
Concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects The concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and consequently on our results of operations and financial position. Events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic sector may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated rather than diversified.
We may suffer losses from litigation As is typical for a large company, we are involved in a substantial amount of litigation, including class action litigation challenging a range of company practices. Our litigation exposure could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition in a future period in the event of an unexpected adverse outcome or if additional reserves are required to be established for such litigation. For a description of our current legal proceedings, see Note13 of the consolidated financial statements.
We are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth As insurance companies, broker-dealers, investment advisers and/or investment companies, many of our subsidiaries are subject to extensive laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex and subject to change. Moreover, they are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities, including state insurance regulators, state securities administrators, the SEC, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the U.S. Department of Justice, and state attorneys general, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude. Consequently, we are subject to the risk that 107 compliance with any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. In addition, there is risk that any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal environment may, even absent any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business. Furthermore, in some cases, these laws and regulations are designed to protect the interests of a specific constituency rather than a range of constituencies. For example, state insurance laws and regulations are generally intended to protect purchasers or users of insurance products, not holders of securities issued by The Allstate Corporation. In many respects, these laws and regulations limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business.
In recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under public scrutiny and members of Congress have discussed proposals to provide for optional federal chartering of insurance companies. We can make no assurances regarding the potential impact of state or federal measures that may change the nature or scope of insurance regulation.
Reinsurance may be unavailable at historical levels and prices which may limit our ability to write new business Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. No assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as are currently available. If we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our net liability exposure, reduce our insurance writings, or develop or seek other alternatives.
Reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect us against losses arising from ceded insurance The collectibility of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers, or their affiliates, have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract. Our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may adversely affect the level of claim losses we incur and the value of our investment portfolio The continued threat of terrorism, both within the United States and abroad, and ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats, may cause significant volatility and declines in the equity markets and with interest rates in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and result in loss of life, property damage, additional disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. Some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism. We seek to mitigate the potential impact of terrorism on our commercial mortgage portfolio by limiting geographical concentrations in key metropolitan areas and by requiring terrorism insurance to the extent 108 that it is commercially available. Additionally, in the event that a terrorist act occurs, both Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial may be adversely affected, depending on the nature of the event.
Any decrease in our financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive position Financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on an insurance company's business. On an ongoing basis, rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers and could downgrade or change the outlook on an insurer's ratings due to, for example, a change in an insurer's statutory capital; a change in a rating agency's determination of the amount of risk-adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating; an increase in the perceived risk of an insurer's investment portfolio; a reduced confidence in management or a host of other considerations that may or may not be under the insurer's control. The insurance financial strength ratings of both AIC and ALIC are A+, AA and Aa2 (fromA.M. Best, Standard& Poor's and Moody's, respectively). Several other affiliates have been assigned their own financial strength ratings by one or more rating agencies. Because all of these ratings are subject to continuous review, the retention of these ratings cannot be assured. A multiple level downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on our sales, our competitiveness, and the marketability of our product offerings impacting our liquidity, operating results and financial condition.
Changes in accounting standards issued by the FASB or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB. It is possible that future changes we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition. For a description of potential changes in accounting standards that could affect us currently, see Note2 of the consolidated financial statements.
The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends may affect our liquidity and ability to meet our debt service obligations The Allstate Corporation is a holding company with no significant operations. The principal asset is the stock of its subsidiaries. State insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, as described in Note15 of the consolidated financial statements. In addition, competitive pressures generally require the subsidiaries to maintain insurance financial strength ratings. These restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of the subsidiaries to make dividend payments. Limits on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends to shareholders and service our debt.
The occurrence of events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems and management continuity planning could impair our ability to conduct business effectively In the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a terrorist attack or war, events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if those events affect our computer-based data processing, transmission, storage and retrieval systems. In the event that a significant number of our managers could be unavailable in the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct our business could be severely compromised.

115 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.General Basis of presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Allstate Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, primarily Allstate Insurance Company ("AIC"), a property-liability insurance company with various property-liability and life and investment subsidiaries, including Allstate Life Insurance Company ("ALIC") (collectively referred to as the "Company" or "Allstate"). These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
To conform to the 2004 presentation, certain amounts in the prior years' consolidated financial statements and notes have been reclassified.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Nature of operations Allstate is engaged, principally in the United States, in the property-liability insurance, life insurance, retirement and investment product business. Allstate's primary business is the sale of private passenger auto and homeowner's insurance. The Company also sells several other personal property and casualty insurance products, life insurance, annuities, funding agreements, and select commercial property and casualty coverages. Allstate primarily distributes its products through exclusive agencies and financial specialists and independent agencies.
The Allstate Protection segment principally sells private passenger auto and homeowner's insurance, with earned premiums accounting for approximately 77% of Allstate's 2004 consolidated revenues. Allstate was the country's second largest insurer for both private passenger auto and homeowners insurance in 2004. Allstate Protection, through several companies, is authorized to sell certain property-liability products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The Company is also authorized to sell certain insurance products in Canada. For 2004, the top geographic locations for premiums earned by the Allstate Protection segment were Texas, California, New York and Florida. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than 5% of premiums earned for Allstate Protection.
Allstate has exposure to catastrophes, an inherent risk of the property-liability insurance business, which have contributed to, and will continue to contribute to, material year-to-year fluctuations in the Company's results of operations and financial position (see Note7). The Company also has exposure to environmental and asbestos claims and other discontinued lines exposures (see Note13).
The Allstate Financial segment sells life insurance, retirement and investment products to individual and institutional customers through several distribution channels. The principal individual products are deferred and immediate fixed annuities, variable annuities, interest-sensitive and traditional life insurance, and supplemental accident and health insurance. The principal institutional product is funding agreements backing medium-term notes.
Allstate Financial, through several companies, is authorized to sell life insurance and retirement products in all 50states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. For 2004, the top geographic locations for statutory premiums and annuity considerations for the Allstate Financial segment were Delaware, New York, California and Florida. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than 5% of statutory premiums and annuity considerations for Allstate Financial. Allstate Financial distributes its products to individuals through multiple intermediary distribution channels, including 116 Allstate Exclusive Agencies, independent agents, banks, broker-dealers, and specialized structured settlement brokers. Allstate Financial has distribution relationships with over half of the 75 largest banks, most of the national broker-dealers, a number of regional brokerage firms and many independent broker-dealers. Allstate Financial sells products through independent agents affiliated with master brokerage agencies. Independent workplace enrolling agents and Allstate Exclusive Agencies also sell Allstate Financial's supplemental accident and health insurance products to employees of small and medium size firms. Allstate Financial sells funding agreements to unaffiliated trusts used to back medium-term notes issued to institutional and individual investors. Banking products and services are sold through the Allstate Bank. Although the Company currently benefits from agreements with financial services entities that market and distribute its products, change in control of these non-affiliated entities could negatively impact Allstate Financial's sales.
The Company monitors economic and regulatory developments that have the potential to impact its business. The ability of banks to affiliate with insurers may have a material adverse effect on all of the Company's product lines by substantially increasing the number, size and financial strength of potential competitors. Furthermore, federal and state laws and regulations affect the taxation of insurance companies and life insurance and annuity products. Congress and various state legislatures have considered proposals that, if enacted, could impose a greater tax burden on the Company or could have an adverse impact on the tax treatment of some insurance products offered by the Company, including favorable policyholder tax treatment currently applicable to life insurance and annuities. Legislation that reduced the federal income tax rates applicable to certain dividends and capital gains realized by individuals, or other proposals, if adopted, that reduce the taxation, or permit the establishment, of certain products or investments that may compete with life insurance or annuities could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial position or ability to sell such products and could result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies. In addition, changes in the federal estate tax laws have negatively affected the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate planning.
2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Investments Fixed income securities include bonds, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and redeemable preferred stocks. Fixed income securities are carried at fair value and may be sold prior to their contractual maturity ("available for sale"). The fair value of publicly traded fixed income securities is based upon independent market quotations. The fair value of non-publicly traded securities is based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models which use internally developed ratings and independent third party data (e.g., term structures and current publicly traded bond prices) as inputs or independent third party pricing sources. The valuation models use indicative information such as ratings, industry, coupon, and maturity along with related third party data and publicly traded bond prices to determine security specific spreads. These spreads are then adjusted for illiquidity based on historical analysis and broker surveys. Periodic changes in fair values, net of deferred income taxes, certain life and annuity deferred policy acquisition costs, certain deferred sales inducement costs, and certain reserves for life-contingent contract benefits, are reflected as a component of other comprehensive income. Cash received from calls, principal payments and make-whole payments is reflected as a component of proceeds from sales. Cash received from maturities and pay-downs is reflected as a component of investment collections.
Equity securities include common and non-redeemable preferred stocks, real estate investment trust equity investments, and limited partnership interests. Common and non-redeemable preferred stocks and real estate investment trust equity investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair 117 value. The difference between cost and fair value, net of deferred income taxes, is reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Investments in limited partnership interests are accounted for in accordance with the equity method of accounting except for instances in which the Company's interest is so minor that it exercises virtually no influence over operating and financial policies, in which case, the Company applies the cost method of accounting.
Mortgage loans are carried at outstanding principal balances, net of unamortized premium or discount and valuation allowances. Valuation allowances are established for impaired loans when it is probable that contractual principal and interest will not be collected. Valuation allowances for impaired loans reduce the carrying value to the fair value of the collateral or the present value of the loan's expected future repayment cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate.
Short-term investments are carried at cost or amortized cost that approximates fair value, and include the reinvestment of collateral received in connection with certain securities included in repurchase, resale and lending activities and collateral posted by counterparties in derivative transactions. For these transactions, the Company records an offsetting liability in other liabilities and accrued expenses for the Company's obligation to repay the collateral. Other investments, which consist primarily of policy loans, are carried at the unpaid principal balances.
Investment income consists primarily of interest and dividends, net investment income from partnership interests and income from certain derivative transactions. Interest is recognized on an accrual basis and dividends are recorded at the ex-dividend date. Interest income on mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities is determined using the effective yield method, based on estimated principal repayments. Interest income on certain beneficial interests in securitized financial assets is determined using the prospective yield method, based upon projections of expected future cash flows. Income from investments in partnership interests, accounted for on the cost basis, is recognized upon receipt of amounts distributed by the partnerships as income. Accrual of income is suspended for fixed income securities and mortgage loans that are in default or when the receipt of interest payments is in doubt.
Realized capital gains and losses include gains and losses on investment dispositions, write-downs in value due to other than temporary declines in fair value and changes in the fair value of certain derivatives including related periodic and final settlements. Realized capital gains and losses on investment dispositions are determined on a specific identification basis.
The Company writes down, to fair value, fixed income and equity securities that are classified as other than temporarily impaired in the period the security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired (see Note5).
Derivative and embedded derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments include swaps, futures, options, interest rate caps and floors, warrants, certain forward contracts for purchases of to-be-announced ("TBA") mortgage securities, certain investment risk transfer reinsurance agreements, forward sale commitments and certain bond forward purchase commitments, mortgage funding commitments and mortgage forward sale commitments. Derivatives that are required to be separated from the host instrument and accounted for as derivative financial instruments ("subject to bifurcation") are embedded in convertible and other fixed income securities, equity-indexed life and annuity contracts, certain variable life and annuity contracts and trust preferred securities issued (see Note6).
All derivatives are accounted for on a fair value basis and reported as other investments, other assets, other liabilities and accrued expenses or contractholder funds. Embedded derivative instruments subject to bifurcation are also accounted for on a fair value basis and are reported together with the host contract. The change in the fair value of derivatives embedded in assets and subject to bifurcation is 118 reported in realized capital gains and losses. The change in the fair value of derivatives embedded in liabilities and subject to bifurcation is reported in life and annuity contract benefits or realized capital gains and losses.
When derivatives meet specific criteria, they may be designated as accounting hedges and accounted for as fair value, cash flow, foreign currency fair value or foreign currency cash flow hedges. The hedged item may be either all or a specific portion of a recognized asset, liability or an unrecognized firm commitment attributable to a particular risk. At the inception of the hedge, the Company formally documents the hedging relationship and risk management objective and strategy. The documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and the methodology used to assess how effective the hedging instrument is in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value attributable to the hedged risk, or in the case of a cash flow hedge, the exposure to changes in the hedged item's or transaction's variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. The Company does not exclude any component of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument from the effectiveness assessment. At each reporting date, the Company confirms that the hedging instrument continues to be highly effective in offsetting the hedged risk. Ineffectiveness in fair value hedges and cash flow hedges is reported in realized capital gains and losses. For the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the hedge ineffectiveness reported as realized capital gains and losses amounted to losses of $1million, gains of $9million and losses of $15million, respectively.
Fair value hedges The Company designates certain of its interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts and certain investment risk transfer reinsurance agreements as fair value hedges when the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged item.
For hedging instruments used in fair value hedges, when the hedged items are investment assets or a portion thereof, the change in the fair value of the derivatives is reported in net investment income, together with the change in the fair value of the hedged items. The change in the fair value of hedging instruments used in fair value hedges of contractholder funds liabilities or a portion thereof are reported in life and annuity contract benefits, together with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. Accrued periodic settlements on swaps are reported together with the changes in fair value of the swaps in net investment income, life and annuity contract benefits or interest expense. The book value of the hedged asset or liability is adjusted for the change in the fair value of the hedged risk.
Cash flow hedges The Company designates certain of its foreign currency swap contracts and bond forward commitments as cash flow hedges when the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting the exposure of variations in cash flows for the hedged risk that could affect net income. The Company's cash flow exposure may be associated with an existing asset, liability, or a forecasted transaction. Anticipated transactions must be probable of occurrence and their significant terms and specific characteristics must be identified.
For hedging instruments used in cash flow hedges, the changes in fair value of the derivatives are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income as unrealized net capital gains and losses. Amounts are reclassified to net investment income or realized capital gains and losses as the hedged transaction affects net income or when the forecasted transaction affects net income. Accrued periodic settlements on derivatives used in cash flow hedges are reported in net investment income. The amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income for a hedged transaction is limited to the lesser of the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative less the amount reclassified to net income; or the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative needed to offset the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction from inception of the hedge less the derivative gain or loss previously 119 reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income. If the Company expects at any time that the loss reported in accumulated other comprehensive income would lead to a net loss on the combination of the hedging instrument and the hedged transaction which may not be recoverable, a loss is recognized immediately in realized capital gains and losses. If an impairment loss is recognized on an asset or an additional obligation is incurred on a liability involved in a hedge transaction, any offsetting gain in accumulated other comprehensive income is reclassified and reported together with the impairment loss or recognition of the obligation.
Termination of hedge accounting If, subsequent to entering into a hedge transaction, the derivative becomes ineffective (including if the hedged item is sold or otherwise extinguished, the occurrence of a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable, or the hedged asset becomes impaired), the Company may terminate the derivative position. The Company may also terminate derivative instruments or redesignate them as non-hedge as a result of other events or circumstances. If the derivative financial instrument is not terminated when a fair value hedge is no longer effective, the future gains and losses recognized on the derivative are reported in realized capital gains and losses. When a fair value hedge is no longer effective, is redesignated as a non-hedge, or when the derivative has been terminated, the gain or loss recognized on the item being hedged and used to adjust the book value of the asset, liability or portion thereof is amortized over the remaining life of the hedged item to net investment income or life and annuity contract benefits, beginning in the period that hedge accounting is no longer applied. If the hedged item of a fair value hedge is an asset, which has become impaired, the adjustment made to the book value of the asset is subject to the accounting policies applied to impaired assets. When a derivative financial instrument used in a cash flow hedge of an existing asset or liability is no longer effective or is terminated, the gain or loss recognized on the derivative is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income as the hedged risk impacts net income, beginning in the period hedge accounting is no longer applied or the derivative instrument is terminated. If the derivative financial instrument is not terminated when a cash flow hedge is no longer effective, the future gains and losses recognized on the derivative are reported in realized capital gains and losses. When a derivative financial instrument used in a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction is terminated because the forecasted transaction is no longer probable the gain or loss recognized on the derivative is immediately reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to realized capital gains and losses in the period that hedge accounting is no longer applied. If the cash flow hedge is no longer effective, the gain or loss recognized on the derivative is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income as the remaining hedged item affects net income.
Non-hedge derivative financial instruments The Company also has certain derivatives that are used in interest rate, equity price and credit risk management strategies for which hedge accounting is not applied. These derivatives primarily consist of indexed instruments, certain interest rate swap agreements and financial futures contracts, interest rate cap and floor agreements, certain forward contracts for TBA mortgage securities and credit default swaps. Based upon the type of derivative instrument and strategy, the income statement effects of these derivatives are reported in a single line item, with the results of the associated risk. Therefore, the derivatives' fair value gains and losses and accrued periodic settlements are recognized together in one of the following during the reporting period: net investment income, realized capital gains and losses, operating costs and expenses or life and annuity contract benefits.
The Company also uses derivatives to replicate returns of fixed income securities that are either unavailable or more expensive in the cash market. These replicated securities are comprised of a credit default swap and a highly rated fixed income security that when combined replicate a third security. Premiums on credit default swaps over the life of the contract and changes in fair value are recorded in realized capital gains and losses.
120 Security repurchase and resale and securities loaned Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, including a mortgage dollar roll program, are treated as financing arrangements and the related obligations to return the collateral are carried at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently resold or reacquired, including accrued interest, as specified in the respective agreements. The Company's policy is to take possession or control of securities purchased under agreements to resell. Assets to be repurchased are the same, or substantially the same, as the assets transferred and the transferor, through the right of substitution, maintains the right and ability to redeem the collateral on short notice. The market value of securities to be repurchased or resold is monitored, and additional collateral is obtained, where appropriate, to protect against credit exposure.
Securities loaned are treated as financing arrangements and the collateral received is recorded in short-term investments, fixed income securities and other liabilities and accrued expenses. The Company obtains collateral in an amount equal to 102% and 105% of the fair value of domestic and foreign securities, respectively. The Company monitors the market value of securities loaned on a daily basis and obtains additional collateral as necessary. Substantially all of the Company's securities loaned are placed with large brokerage firms.
Security repurchase and resale agreements and securities lending transactions are used to generate net investment income. The cash received from repurchase and resale agreements also provides a source of liquidity. These instruments are short-term in nature (usually 30days or less) and are collateralized principally by Corporate, U.S. Government and mortgage-backed securities. The carrying values of these instruments approximate fair value because of their relatively short-term nature.
Recognition of premium revenues and contract charges, and related benefits and interest credited Property-liability premiums are deferred and earned on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies. The portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums. Premium installment receivables, net, include premiums written and not yet collected. The Company regularly evaluates premium installment receivables and establishes valuation allowances as appropriate. The valuation allowance for uncollectible premium installment receivables was $48million and $44million at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Traditional life insurance products consist principally of products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits, primarily term and whole life insurance products. Premiums from these products are recognized as revenue when due. Benefits are recognized in relation to such revenue so as to result in the recognition of profits over the life of the policy and are reflected in life and annuity contract benefits.
Immediate annuities with life contingencies, including certain structured settlement annuities, provide insurance protection over a period that extends beyond the period during which premiums are collected. Premiums from these products are recognized as revenue when due, at the inception of the contract. Benefits and expenses are recognized in relation to such revenue such that profits are recognized over the lives of the contracts.
Interest-sensitive life contracts, such as universal life and single premium life, are insurance contracts whose terms are not fixed and guaranteed. The terms that may be changed include premiums paid by the contractholder, interest credited to the contractholder account balance and any amounts assessed against the contractholder account balance. Premiums from these contracts are reported as contractholder fund deposits. Contract charges consist of fees assessed against the contractholder account balance for cost of insurance (mortality risk), contract administration and early surrender. These revenues are recognized when assessed against the contractholder account balance. Life and annuity contract benefits include life-contingent benefit payments in excess of the contractholder account balance.
121 Contracts that do not subject the Company to significant risk arising from mortality or morbidity are referred to as investment contracts. Fixed annuities, including market value adjusted annuities, equity-indexed annuities and immediate annuities without life contingencies, funding agreements (primarily backing medium-term notes) and certain guaranteed investment contracts ("GICs") are considered investment contracts. Deposits received for such contracts are reported as contractholder fund deposits. Contract charges for investment contracts consist of fees assessed against the contractholder account balance for maintenance, administration, and surrender of the contract prior to contractually specified dates, and are recognized when assessed against the contractholder account balance.
Interest credited to contractholder funds represents interest accrued or paid on interest-sensitive life contracts and investment contracts. Crediting rates for certain fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life contracts are adjusted periodically by the Company to reflect current market conditions subject to contractually guaranteed minimum rates. Crediting rates for indexed annuities and indexed funding agreements are based on a specified index, such as LIBOR, or an equity index, such as the S&P500. Pursuant to the adoption of Statement of Position No.03-1, "Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts" ("SOP03-1") in 2004, interest credited also includes amortization of deferred sales inducement ("DSI") expenses. DSI is amortized into interest credited using the same method used for deferred policy acquisition costs.
Separate account products include variable annuities and variable life insurance contracts. The assets supporting these products are legally segregated and available only to settle separate account contract obligations. Deposits received are reported as separate accounts liabilities. Contract charges for these products consist of fees assessed against the contractholder account values for contract maintenance, administration, mortality, expense and early surrender. Contract benefits incurred include guaranteed minimum death, income and accumulation benefits incurred on variable annuity and life insurance contracts.
Deferred policy acquisition and sales inducement costs Costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring property-liability insurance, life insurance and investment contracts are deferred and recorded as deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC"). These costs are principally agents' and brokers' remuneration, premium taxes, inspection costs, certain underwriting costs and direct mail solicitation expenses. DSI costs related to sales inducements offered on sales to new customers, principally on investment contracts and primarily in the form of additional credits to the customer's account value or enhancements to interest credited for a specified period, which are beyond amounts currently being credited to existing contracts, are deferred and recorded as other assets. All other acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and included in operating costs and expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. DAC associated with property-liability insurance is amortized to income as premiums are earned, and is included in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Future investment income is considered in determining the recoverability of DAC. DAC associated with life insurance and investment contracts is amortized to income and included in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. DSI is amortized to income using the same methodology and assumptions as DAC and is included in interest credited to contractholder funds on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. DAC and DSI associated with life insurance and investment contracts is periodically reviewed for recoverability and written down when necessary.
For traditional life insurance and other premium paying contracts, DAC is amortized in proportion to the estimated revenues on such business. Assumptions used in amortization of DAC and reserve calculations are determined based upon conditions as of the date of policy issue and are generally not revised during the life of the policy. Any deviations from projected business in force, resulting from actual 122 policy terminations differing from expected levels, and any estimated premium deficiencies change the rate of amortization in the period such events occur. Generally, the amortization period for these contracts approximates the estimated lives of the policies.
For internal exchanges of traditional life insurance, the unamortized balance of costs previously deferred under the original contracts are charged to income. The new costs associated with the exchange are deferred and amortized to income.
For interest-sensitive life, variable annuities and investment contracts, DAC and DSI are amortized in proportion to the incidence of the present value of estimated gross profits ("EGP") on such business over the estimated lives of the contracts. Generally, the amortization period ranges from 15-30years; however, estimates of customer surrender rates result in the majority of deferred costs being amortized over the surrender charge period. The rate of amortization during this term is matched to the pattern of EGP. EGP consists of estimates of the following components: benefit margins, primarily from mortality, including guaranteed minimum death, income, and accumulation benefits; investment margin including realized capital gains and losses; and contract administration, surrender and other contract charges, less maintenance expenses.
DAC and DSI amortization for variable annuity and life contracts is estimated using stochastic modeling and is significantly impacted by the return on the underlying funds. The Company's long-term expectation of separate accounts fund performance net of fees was approximately 8%. Whenever actual separate accounts fund performance based on the two most recent years varies from the 8% expectation, the Company projects performance levels over the next five years such that the mean return over that seven year period equals the long-term 8% expectation. This approach is commonly referred to as "reversion to the mean" and is commonly used by the life insurance industry as an appropriate method for amortizing variable annuity and life DAC and DSI. In applying the reversion to the mean process, the Company does not allow the future mean rates of return after fees projected over the five-year period to exceed 12.75% or fall below 0%. The Company periodically evaluates the results of utilization of this process to confirm that it is reasonably possible that variable annuity and life fund performance will revert to the expected long-term mean within this time horizon.
Changes in the amount or timing of EGP result in adjustments to the cumulative amortization of DAC and DSI. All such adjustments are reflected in the current results of operations.
The Company performs quarterly reviews of DAC and DSI recoverability for interest-sensitive life, variable annuities and investment contracts in the aggregate using current assumptions. If a change in the amount of EGP is significant, it could result in the unamortized DAC and DSI not being recoverable, resulting in a charge which is included as a component of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs or interest credited to contractholder funds, respectively, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The cost assigned to the right to receive future cash flows from certain business purchased from other insurers is also classified as deferred policy acquisition costs in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The costs capitalized represent the present value of future profits expected to be earned over the life of the contracts acquired. These costs are amortized as profits emerge over the life of the acquired business and are periodically evaluated for recoverability. Present value of future profits was $175million and $182million at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Amortization expense on present value of future profits was $19million, $55million and $49million for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
123 Reinsurance recoverables In the normal course of business, the Company seeks to limit aggregate and single exposure to losses on large risks by purchasing reinsurance from reinsurers (see Note9). The amounts reported in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include amounts billed to reinsurers on losses paid as well as estimates of amounts expected to be recovered from reinsurers on incurred losses that have not yet been paid. Reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses are estimated based upon assumptions consistent with those used in establishing the liabilities related to the underlying reinsured contract. Insurance liabilities are reported gross of reinsurance recoverables. Prepaid reinsurance premiums are deferred and reflected in income in a manner consistent with the recognition of premiums on the reinsured contracts. Reinsurance does not extinguish the Company's primary liability under the policies written. Therefore, the Company regularly evaluates the financial condition of the reinsurers including their activities with respect to claim settlement practices and commutations, and establishes allowances for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables as appropriate.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquiring businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No.142, "Goodwill and other Intangible Assets", effective January1, 2002. The statement eliminates the requirement to amortize goodwill and requires that goodwill and separately identified intangible assets with indefinite lives be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) on a fair value basis.
During the second quarter of 2002, the Company completed its initial goodwill impairment test and recorded a $331million after-tax impairment charge, which is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The impairment relates to goodwill arising from the Company's purchase of American Heritage Life Investment Corporation ("AHL") in 1999 and Pembridge,Inc. in 1998 and is the result of the Company adopting the fair value-based approach to goodwill impairment testing required by SFAS No.142.
The Company annually tests goodwill for impairment using a trading multiple analysis, which is a widely accepted valuation technique, to estimate the fair value of its SFAS No.142 reporting units. Based on the Company's decision to sell two life insurance companies for their licenses, the Company recognized an aggregate goodwill and other intangible assets impairment loss of $4million ($2million after-tax) in 2004. In 2004, the Company also determined that approximately $100million of certain Encompass related liabilities originally established through purchase accounting were no longer necessary and, as a result, were eliminated through a reduction of the related goodwill.
Goodwill impairment testing indicated no impairment at December31, 2003.
Property and equipment Property and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Included in property and equipment are capitalized costs related to computer software licenses and software developed for internal use. These costs generally consist of certain external payroll and payroll related costs. Property and equipment depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 3 to 10years for equipment and 40years for real property. Certain facilities and equipment held under capital and synthetic leases are classified as property and equipment and amortized using the straight-line method over the lease terms with the related obligations recorded as liabilities. Depreciation expense, including lease amortization, is reported in operating costs and expenses. Accumulated depreciation on property and equipment was $1.52billion and $1.37billion at December31, 124 2004 and 2003, respectively. Depreciation expense on property and equipment was $219million, $225million and $205million for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company reviews its property and equipment for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Income taxes The income tax provision is calculated under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. The principal assets and liabilities giving rise to such differences are unrealized capital gains and losses on certain investments, insurance reserves, unearned premiums, deferred policy acquisition costs and employee benefits. A deferred tax asset valuation allowance is established when there is uncertainty that such assets would be realized.
Reserves for property liability insurance claims and claims expense and life-contingent contract benefits The reserve for property-liability claims and claims expense is the estimated amount necessary to settle both reported and unreported claims of insured property-liability losses, based upon the facts in each case and the Company's experience with similar cases. Estimated amounts of salvage and subrogation are deducted from the reserve for claims and claims expense. The establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain process. Reserve estimates are regularly reviewed and updated, using the most current information available. Any resulting reestimates are reflected in current operations (see Note7).
The reserve for life-contingent contract benefits, which relates to traditional life and supplemental accident and health insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies, is computed on the basis of long-term actuarial assumptions as to future investment yields, mortality, morbidity, terminations and expenses. These assumptions, which for traditional life insurance are applied using the net level premium method, include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by such characteristics as type of coverage, year of issue and policy duration. Detailed reserve assumptions and reserve interest rates are outlined in Note8. To the extent that unrealized gains on fixed income securities would result in a premium deficiency had those gains actually been realized, the related increase in reserves for certain immediate annuities with life contingencies is recorded net of tax as a reduction of the unrealized net capital gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Contractholder funds Contractholder funds represent interest-bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products, such as interest-sensitive life, fixed annuities, bank deposits and funding agreements. Contractholder funds are comprised primarily of deposits received and interest credited to the benefit of the contractholder less surrenders and withdrawals, mortality charges and administrative expenses. Contractholder funds also include reserves for secondary guarantees on interest-sensitive life insurance and certain fixed annuity contracts. Detailed information on crediting rates and surrender and withdrawal provisions on contractholder funds are outlined in Note8.
Separate accounts The Company issues variable annuities and variable life insurance contracts, the assets and liabilities of which are legally segregated and recorded as assets and liabilities of the separate accounts. The assets of the separate accounts are carried at fair value. Separate accounts liabilities represent the 125 contractholders' claims to the related assets and are carried at the fair value of the assets. Investment income and realized capital gains and losses of the separate accounts accrue directly to the contractholders and therefore, are not included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenues to the Company from the separate accounts consist of contract charges for maintenance, administration, cost of insurance and surrender of the contract prior to the contractually specified dates and are reflected in life and annuity premiums and contract charges. Deposits to the separate accounts are not included in consolidated cash flows.
Absent any contract provision wherein the Company guarantees either a minimum return or account value upon death, a specified contract anniversary date, or annuitization, variable annuity and variable life insurance contractholders bear the investment risk that the separate accounts' funds may not meet their stated investment objectives. The account balances of variable contracts' separate accounts with guarantees included $13.41billion of equity, fixed income and balanced mutual funds and $656million of money market mutual funds at December31, 2004.
Liabilities for variable contract guarantees The Company offers various guarantees to variable annuity contractholders including a return of no less than (a)total deposits made on the contract less any customer withdrawals, (b)total deposits made on the contract less any customer withdrawals plus a minimum return or (c)the highest contract value on a specified anniversary date minus any customer withdrawals following the contract anniversary. These guarantees include benefits that are payable in the event of death (death benefits), upon annuitization (income benefits), or at specified dates during the accumulation period (accumulation benefits). Liabilities for variable contract guarantees related to death benefits are included in reserve for life-contingent contract benefits and the liabilities related to the income and accumulation benefits are included in contractholder funds in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Detailed information regarding the Company's variable contracts with guarantees is outlined in Note8.
Pursuant to the adoption of SOP 03-1 in 2004, the liability for death and income benefit guarantees is established equal to a benefit ratio multiplied by the cumulative contract charges earned, plus accrued interest less contract benefit payments. The benefit ratio is calculated as the estimated present value of all expected contract benefits divided by the present value of all expected contract charges. The establishment of reserves for these guarantees requires the projection of future separate account fund performance, mortality, persistency and customer benefit utilization rates. These assumptions are periodically reviewed and updated. For guarantees related to death benefits, benefits represent the current guaranteed minimum death benefit payments in excess of the current account balance. For guarantees related to income benefits, benefits represent the present value of the minimum guaranteed annuitization benefits in excess of the current account balance.
Projected benefits and contract charges used in determining the liability for certain guarantees are developed using models and stochastic scenarios that are also used in the development of estimated expected gross profits. Underlying assumptions for the liability related to income benefits include assumed future annuitization elections based on factors such as the extent of benefit to the potential annuitant, eligibility conditions and the annuitant's attained age. The liability for guarantees is re-evaluated periodically, and adjustments are made to the liability balance through a charge or credit to life and annuity contract benefits.
Guarantees related to accumulation benefits are considered to be derivative financial instruments; therefore, the liability for accumulation benefits is established based on its fair value.
126 Deferred compensation expense Deferred compensation expense represents the remaining unrecognized cost of shares acquired by the Allstate Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") to pre-fund a portion of the Company's contribution to The Savings and Profit Sharing Plan of Allstate Employees and the unrecognized cost associated with the restricted shares granted under equity incentive plans for Allstate employees (see Note17). A detailed description of the ESOP and the impacts on the consolidated financial statements is included in Note16.
Equity Incentive Plans The Company has three equity incentive plans which permit the Company to grant nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted or unrestricted shares of the Company's stock and restricted stock units to certain employees and directors of the Company. In 2003, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFASNo.123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", and selected the prospective method of adoption in accordance with SFAS No.148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation". Therefore, the Company began prospectively expensing the fair value of all stock options granted on or after January1, 2003. In 2002, the Company applied APB 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"), and related Interpretations in accounting for its employee equity incentive plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost was recognized in 2002 for its employee plan as the exercise price of the options equaled the market price at the grant date. See Note17 for pro forma net income and earnings per share, as well as additional information related to equity incentive plans.
Off-balance-sheet financial instruments Commitments to invest, commitments to purchase private placement securities, commitments to extend mortgage loans, financial guarantees and credit guarantees have off-balance-sheet risk because their contractual amounts are not recorded in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The contractual amounts and fair values of these instruments are outlined in Note6.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("VIEs") The Company consolidates VIEs when it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE and if it has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of the entity's expected returns, or both (see Note11).
Foreign currency translation The local currency of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is deemed to be the functional currency in which these subsidiaries operate. The financial statements of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of a reporting period for assets and liabilities and at average exchange rates during the period for results of operations. The unrealized gains and losses from the translation of the net assets are recorded as unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments and included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Changes in unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments are included in other comprehensive income. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are reported in operating costs and expenses and have not been significant.
127 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on weighted average number of common and dilutive potential common shares outstanding. For Allstate, dilutive potential common shares consist of outstanding stock options.
The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December31, are presented in the following table.
(in millions, except per share data) 2004 2003 2002 Numerator (applicable to common shareholders): Income before dividends on preferred securities and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after-tax $ 3,356 $ 2,725 $ 1,475 Dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts  (5 ) (10 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after-tax (175 ) (15 ) (331 ) Net income applicable to common shareholders $ 3,181 $ 2,705 $ 1,134 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding 695.6 703.5 707.1 Effect of potential dilutive securities: Stock options 4.7 2.7 2.8 4.7 2.7 2.8 Weighted average common and dilutive potential common shares outstanding 700.3 706.2 709.9 Earnings per shareBasic: Income before dividends on preferred securities and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after-tax $ 4.82 $ 3.87 $ 2.08 Dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts   (0.01 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after-tax (0.25 ) (0.02 ) (0.47 ) Net income applicable to common shareholders $ 4.57 $ 3.85 $ 1.60 Earnings per shareDiluted: Income before dividends on preferred securities and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after-tax $ 4.79 $ 3.85 $ 2.07 Dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts   (0.01 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after-tax (0.25 ) (0.02 ) (0.46 ) Net income applicable to common shareholders $ 4.54 $ 3.83 $ 1.60 Options to purchase 3.1million, 8.7million and 9.0million Allstate common shares, with exercise prices ranging from $46.99 to $50.79, $36.99 to $50.72 and $37.06 to $50.72, were outstanding at December31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share since inclusion of those options would have an anti-dilutive effect as the options' exercise prices exceeded the average market price of Allstate common shares in those years.
128 Adopted accounting standards Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No.03-1, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments" ("EITF03-1") and FSP EITF03-1-1, "Effective Date of Paragraphs10-20 of EITF Issue No.03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments" ("FSP EITF03-1-1") In March2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") reached a final consensus on EITF03-1, which was to be effective for fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2004. EITF03-1 requires that when the fair value of an investment security is less than its carrying value an impairment exists for which a determination must be made as to whether the impairment is temporary or other-than-temporary. In September2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued, and the Company adopted, FSP EITF Issue03-1-1, which deferred the effective date of the impairment measurement and recognition provisions contained in paragraphs10-20 of EITF03-1 until proposed FSP EITF03-1-a is issued as final guidance (See Pending and Recently Issued Accounting Standards). The disclosure requirements of EITF03-1 were previously adopted by the Company as of December31, 2003 for investments accounted for under SFAS No.115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities". For all other investments within the scope of EITF03-1, the disclosures are effective and have been adopted by the Company as of December31, 2004.
FASB Staff Position Nos. FAS106-1 and FAS106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003" ("FSP FAS106-1" and "FSP FAS106-2") In January2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS106-1 to address the accounting implications of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 ("Act"). The Act, which was signed into law on December8, 2003, provides, among other things, a federal subsidy to plan sponsors who maintain postretirement health care plans ("plans") that provide prescription drug benefits and meet certain equivalency criteria. FSP FAS106-1 allowed reporting entities to make a one-time election to defer recognizing the impact of the Act on their accumulated postretirement benefit obligation ("APBO") and net periodic postretirement benefit cost determined in accordance with SFAS No.106, "Employer's Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" until sufficient guidance was developed to permit a determination of both the qualification for the subsidy and how to recognize the impact of the subsidy on its APBO and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. The Company adopted FSP FAS106-1 in the first quarter of 2004 and elected to defer recognition of the accounting impact of the Act as information was not available to determine with sufficient certainty whether the Company's plans meet the equivalency criteria, and if so, how to recognize the impact of the subsidy on its APBO and net periodic postretirement benefit cost.
In May2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS106-2, which supercedes FSP FAS106-1, to provide guidance on accounting for the effects of the Act. FSP FAS106-2, which the Company adopted in the third quarter of 2004, requires reporting entities that elected deferral under FSP FAS106-1 and are able to determine if their plans are actuarially equivalent to recognize the impact of the Act no later than the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June15, 2004. In July2004, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") issued proposed regulations for the Act, including three different proposals for the determination of actuarial equivalence. Depending on which proposal is adopted, the Company's plans may not meet the actuarial equivalence criteria. As a result, the Company was unable to determine if its plans are actuarially equivalent, accordingly, the measurement of its APBO and net periodic postretirement benefit cost do not reflect any amount associated with the subsidy at December31, 2004. In January2005, the CMS issued the final regulations for the Act including the determination of actuarial 129 equivalence. The Company is currently evaluating the final regulations and the potential impact of the Act on its APBO and net periodic postretirement benefit cost which is not expected to be material to the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations or Financial Position.
SOP 03-1 , " Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts" ("SOP 03-1") On January1, 2004, the Company adopted SOP 03-1. The major provisions of the SOP affecting the Company require:  Establishment of reserves primarily related to death benefit and income benefit guarantees provided under variable annuity contracts;  Deferral of sales inducements that meet certain criteria, and amortization using the same method used for DAC; and  Reporting and measuring assets and liabilities of certain separate accounts products as investments and contractholder funds rather than as separate accounts assets and liabilities when specified criteria are present.
The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle from implementing SOP 03-1 was a loss of $175million, after-tax ($269million, pre-tax). It was comprised of an increase in benefit reserves (primarily for variable annuity contracts) of $145million, pre-tax, and a reduction in DAC and DSI of $124million, pre-tax.
The SOP requires consideration of a range of potential results to estimate the cost of variable annuity death benefits and income benefits, which generally necessitates the use of stochastic modeling techniques. To maintain consistency with the assumptions used in the establishment of reserves for variable annuity guarantees, the Company utilized the results of this stochastic modeling to estimate expected gross profits, which form the basis for determining the amortization of DAC and DSI. This new modeling approach resulted in a lower estimate of expected gross profits, and therefore resulted in a write-down of DAC and DSI.
In 2004, DSI and related amortization is classified within the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and Operations as other assets and interest credited to contractholder funds, respectively. The amounts are provided in Note10. Pursuant to adopting this guidance, the Company also reclassified $204million of separate accounts assets and liabilities to investments and contractholder funds, respectively.
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") Technical Practice Aid ("TPA") re. SOP 03-1 In September2004, the staff of the AICPA, aided by industry experts, issued a set of technical questions and answers on financial accounting and reporting issues related to SOP 03-1 that will be included in the AICPA's TPAs. The TPA addresses a number of issues related to SOP 03-1 including when it is necessary to establish a liability in addition to the account balance for certain contracts such as single premium and universal life that meet the definition of an insurance contract and have amounts assessed against the contractholder in a manner that is expected to result in profits in earlier years and losses in subsequent years from the insurance benefit function. The impact of adopting the provisions of the TPA was not material to the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations or Financial Position.
FASB Interpretation No.46 and 46R, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46" and "FIN 46R") In December2003, the FASB revised FIN 46, which was originally issued in January2003. FIN 46R addressed whether certain types of entities, referred to as variable interest entities ("VIEs"), should be 130 consolidated in a company's financial statements. A company must consolidate a VIE if it has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of the entity's expected returns, or both. The Company elected to adopt FIN 46 as of July1, 2003 for its existing VIEs with the exception of two VIEs used to manage assets on behalf of unrelated third party investors. FIN 46 was adopted as of December31, 2003 for those remaining VIEs subsequent to the issuance of FIN 46R. See Note11 for the impact of adoption.
SFAS No.149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No.149") In April2003, the FASB issued SFAS No.149, which amends, clarifies and codifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and used for hedging activities under SFAS No.133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities". While this statement applies primarily to certain derivative contracts and embedded derivatives entered into or modified after June30, 2003, it also codifies conclusions previously reached by the FASB at various dates on certain implementation issues. The impact of adopting the provisions of the statement was not material to the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations or Financial Position.
Derivatives Implementation Group Statement 133 Implementation Issue No. B36, "Embedded Derivatives: Modified Coinsurance Arrangements and Debt Instruments That Incorporate Credit Risk Exposures That Are Unrelated or Only Partially Related to the Creditworthiness of the Obligor under Those Instruments"("Implementation Issue B36") In April2003, the FASB issued Implementation Issue B36, which became effective October1, 2003. Implementation Issue B36 was applied to one of the Company's modified coinsurance agreements, and as a result, the embedded derivative was bifurcated from the agreement and marked to market value at October1, 2003. The effect of adopting Implementation Issue B36 was the recognition of a loss of $17million, after-tax, which is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
SFAS No.148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS No.148") In December2002, the FASB issued SFAS No.148 which amends SFAS No.123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation". The amendment enabled companies that choose to adopt the fair value based method to report the full effect of employee stock options in their financial statements immediately upon adoption. The statement sets forth clearer and more prominent disclosures about the cost of employee stock options and increased the frequency of those disclosures to include publication in quarterly financial statements. Beginning January1, 2003, the Company began expensing the fair value of all stock options granted on or after January1, 2003. The Company recognized $9million, after-tax, expense associated with stock options granted during the twelve months ended December31, 2003.
Pending Accounting Standards SFAS No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("SFAS No.123R") In December2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.123R, which revises SFAS No.123 and supersedes APB 25. SFAS No.123R eliminates an entity's ability to account for share-based payments using APB 25 and requires all such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method. In addition, although it does not require use of a binomial lattice model, SFAS No.123R indicates that a binomial lattice model may be more effective in valuing employee stock options than the Black-Scholes model, 131 which was primarily developed to value publicly traded options. SFAS No.123R is effective for all awards granted, modified, repurchased, or cancelled in the interim period beginning after June15, 2005 and requires the recognition of compensation cost over the remaining vesting period for the portion of outstanding awards that are not vested as of the effective date. Beginning January1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value based method of accounting for all stock options granted or modified on or after January1, 2003. Beginning in 2005, the Company will begin using a binomial lattice model instead of the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of employee stock options. SFAS No.123R is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations or Financial Position.
FSP EITF Issue 03-1-a, "Implementation Guidance for the Application of Paragraph16 of EITF Issue No.03-1, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments" ("FSP EITF Issue 03-1-a").
In September2004, the FASB issued proposed FSP EITF 03-1-a to address the application of paragraph16 of EITF Issue 03-1 to debt securities that are impaired because of increases in interest rates, and/or sector spreads. Thereafter, in connection with its decision to defer the effective date of paragraphs 10-20 of EITF 03-1 through the issuance of FSP EITF Issue 03-1-1, the FASB requested from its constituents comments on the issues set forth in FSP EITF03-1-a and the issues that arose during the comment letter process for FSP EITF03-1-b, "Effective Date of Paragraph16 of EITF Issue No.03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments".
Due to the uncertainty as to how the outstanding issues will be resolved, the Company is unable to determine the impact of adopting paragraphs 10-20 of EITF 03-1 until final implementation guidance is issued. Adoption of paragraphs 10-20 of EITF 03-1 may have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations but is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as fluctuations in fair value are already recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
3.Dispositions In 2004, the Company disposed of Columbia Universal Life Insurance Company ("CUL"), a wholly owned life insurance subsidiary, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement with Verde Financial Corporation. As a result, the Company recognized a nominal gain on the disposition and a net tax benefit of approximately $11million. The tax benefit was reported as a reduction of the Company's income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. All contracts in force, primarily fixed annuity and interest-sensitive life policies written by CUL, had been ceded to ALIC or third party reinsurers prior to the disposition.
In 2004, the Company disposed of a portion of its equity investment in a consolidated investment management VIE. This action triggered a reconsideration of whether the Company remained the primary beneficiary of the investment management VIE under FIN 46R. After such reconsideration, the Company determined it was no longer the primary beneficiary of the investment management VIE. Therefore, the investment management VIE was deconsolidated as of the disposition date in the first quarter of 2004. The deconsolidation of the investment management VIE resulted in a decrease in assets of $428million and a decrease in long-term debt of $412million at the time of deconsolidation. The carrying value of the Company's portion of its investment in this investment management VIE reported in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as fixed income securities was $.3million at December31, 2004.
In 2003, the Company announced its intention to exit the Allstate Financial direct response distribution business and, based on its decision to sell the business, reached a measurement date that resulted in the recognition of an estimated loss on the disposition of $44million ($29million, after-tax). In 132 2004, the Company disposed of substantially all of Allstate Financial's direct response distribution business pursuant to reinsurance transactions with subsidiaries of Citigroup and Scottish Re (U.S.)Inc. In connection with those disposal activities, the Company recorded an additional loss on disposition of $21million pretax ($14million after-tax) in 2004 (see Notes 9 and 10).
4.Supplemental Cash Flow Information Non-cash investment exchanges and modifications, which primarily reflect refinancings of fixed income securities and mergers completed with equity securities, totaled $149million, $56million and $137million for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Because of the potential for prepayment on mortgage- and asset-backed securities, they are not categorized by contractual maturity. The commercial mortgage-backed securities are categorized by contractual maturity because they generally are not subject to prepayment risk.

Some of the factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary are: 1)the Company's ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; 2)the recoverability of principal and interest; 3)the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities; 4)the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects of the issuer, including relevant industry conditions and trends, and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices; and 5)the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position, including market conditions which could affect access to liquidity.
136 The following table summarizes the gross unrealized losses and fair value of fixed income and equity securities by the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position.

137 Of the $221million and $290million, $169million and $234million, respectively, related to unrealized losses on investment grade fixed income securities. Investment grade is defined as a security having a rating from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") of 1 or 2; a rating of Aaa, Aa, A or Baa from Moody's or a rating of AAA, AA, A or BBB from Standard& Poor's ("S&P"), Fitch or Dominion; or a comparable internal rating if an externally provided rating is not available. Unrealized losses on investment grade securities are principally related to changes in interest rates or changes in issuer and sector related credit spreads since the securities were acquired.
As of December31, 2004, the remaining $21million of unrealized losses related to securities in unrealized loss positions greater than or equal to 20% of cost or amortized cost. Of the $21million, $2million related to investment grade fixed income securities, $16million related to below investment grade fixed income securities and $3million related to equity securities. Of these amounts, $9million of the below investment grade fixed income securities and $0million of equity securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of twelve months or more as of December31, 2004. Additionally, $11million of the unrealized losses from below investment grade securities were airline industry issues.
As of December31, 2003, the remaining $98million of unrealized losses related to securities in unrealized loss positions greater than or equal to 20% of cost or amortized cost. Of the $98million, $28million related to investment grade fixed income securities, $61million related to below investment grade fixed income securities and $9million related to equity securities. Of these amounts, $10million, $31million and $1million, respectively, had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of twelve months or more as of December31, 2003. Additionally, $13million of the unrealized losses from below investment grade securities were airline industry issues.
As of December31, 2004 and 2003, the securities comprising the $21million and $98million, respectively, of unrealized losses were evaluated based on factors such as the financial condition and near-term and long-term prospects of the issuer and were determined to have adequate resources to fulfill contractual obligations, such as recent financings or bank loans, cash flows from operations, collateral or the position of a subsidiary with respect to its parent's bankruptcy.
As of December31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had the intent and ability to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient for them to recover in value.
As of December31, 2004, the carrying value for cost method investments was $467million, which primarily included limited partnership interests in fund investments. Each cost method investment was evaluated utilizing certain criteria such as a measurement of the Company's percentage share of the investee's equity relative to the carrying value and certain financial trends to determine if an event or change in circumstance occurred that could indicate an other-than-temporary impairment existed. Investments meeting any one of these criteria were further evaluated and, if it was determined that an other-than-temporary impairment existed, the investment was written down to the estimated fair value. The estimated fair value was generally based on the fair value of the underlying investments in the limited partnership funds. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of each cost method investment in accordance with paragraphs 14 and 15 of SFAS107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments" because the investments are private in nature and do not trade frequently. In addition, the information that would be utilized to estimate fair value is not readily available. The Company had write-downs of $14million related to cost method investments that were other-than-temporarily impaired in 2004.
Mortgage loan impairment A mortgage loan is impaired when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
138 The net carrying value of impaired loans at December31, 2004 and 2003 was $22million and $4million, respectively. No valuation allowances were held at December31, 2004 and 2003 because the fair value of the collateral was greater than the recorded investment in the loans.
Interest income for impaired loans is recognized on an accrual basis if payments are expected to continue to be received; otherwise cash basis is used. The Company recognized interest income on impaired loans of $2million, $2million, and $1million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The average balance of impaired loans was $29million, $23million and $16million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Valuation allowances charged to operations during 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $1million, $3million and $0million, respectively. Direct write-downs charged against the allowances were $0million, $3million and $5million for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and in 2004, $1million of a balance previously written off was recovered.
Investment concentration for municipal bond and commercial mortgage portfolios and other investment information The Company maintains a diversified portfolio of municipal bonds. The following table shows the principal geographic distribution of municipal bond issuers represented in the Company's portfolio. No other state represents more than 5.0% of the portfolio at December31, 2004.
(% of municipal bond portfolio carrying value) 2004 2003 California 13.3 % 12.3 % Texas 11.1 11.2 Illinois 7.7 9.3 New York 5.4 5.8 The Company's mortgage loans are collateralized by a variety of commercial real estate property types located throughout the United States. Substantially all of the commercial mortgage loans are non-recourse to the borrower. The following table shows the principal geographic distribution of commercial real estate represented in the Company's mortgage portfolio. No other state represented more than 5.0% of the portfolio at December31, 2004 and 2003.

Of these, 63% were paid as due, 26% were refinanced at prevailing market terms and 11% were extended for one year or less. None were foreclosed or in the process of foreclosure, and none were in the process of refinancing or restructuring discussions.
At December31, 2004, the carrying value of residential mortgage loans outstanding was $2million.
Included in fixed income securities are below investment grade assets totaling $5.64billion and $6.01billion at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
At December31, 2004, the carrying value of investments that were non-income producing, excluding equity securities, was $20million. At December31, 2004, fixed income securities with a carrying value of $315million were on deposit with regulatory authorities as required by law.
Security repurchase and resale and securities loaned The Company participates in securities lending programs with third parties, mostly large brokerage firms. At December31, 2004 and 2003, fixed income securities with a carrying value of $2.89billion and $2.16billion, respectively, were on loan under these agreements. In return, the Company receives cash that it invests and includes in short-term investments and fixed income securities, with an offsetting liability recorded in other liabilities and accrued expenses to account for the Company's obligation to return the collateral. Interest income on collateral, net of fees, was $6million, $6million and $9million, for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
The Company participates in programs to purchase securities under agreements to resell and programs to sell securities under agreements to repurchase, primarily including a mortgage dollar roll program. At the end of December31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had $1.16billion and $1.13billion of 140 securities that were subject to these agreements. In return, the Company receives cash collateral that it invests and includes in short-term and fixed income securities, with an offsetting liability recorded in other liabilities and accrued expenses to account for the Company's obligation to return the collateral. Interest income recorded as a result of the program was $47million, $39million, and $40million for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
6.Financial Instruments In the normal course of business, the Company invests in various financial assets, incurs various financial liabilities and enters into agreements involving derivative financial instruments and other off-balance-sheet financial instruments. The fair value estimates of financial instruments presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company might pay or receive in actual market transactions. Potential taxes and other transaction costs have not been considered in estimating fair value. The disclosures that follow do not reflect the fair value of the Company as a whole since a number of the Company's significant assets (including DAC, property and equipment, net and reinsurance recoverables, net) and liabilities (including reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense, reserve for life-contingent contract benefits and deferred income taxes) are not considered financial instruments and are not carried at fair value. Other assets and liabilities considered financial instruments such as premium installment receivables, accrued investment income, cash and claim payments outstanding are generally of a short-term nature. Their carrying values are deemed to approximate fair value.
Financial assets December31, 2004 December31, 2003 Carrying value Fair value Carrying value Fair value Fixed income securities $ 95,715 $ 95,715 $ 87,741 $ 87,741 Equity securities 5,895 5,895 5,288 5,288 Mortgage loans 7,856 8,187 6,539 6,937 Short-term investments 4,133 4,133 1,815 1,815 Policy loans 1,217 1,217 1,250 1,250 Separate Accounts 14,377 14,377 13,425 13,425 Fair values of publicly traded fixed income securities are based upon quoted market prices or dealer quotes. The fair value of non-publicly traded securities, primarily privately placed corporate obligations, is based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models, which use internally developed ratings and independent third party data (e.g., term structures and current publicly traded bond prices) as inputs, or independent third party pricing sources. Equity securities are valued based principally on quoted market prices. Mortgage loans are valued based on discounted contractual cash flows. Discount rates are selected using current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar characteristics, using similar properties as collateral. Loans that exceed 100% loan-to-value are valued at the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. Short-term investments are highly liquid investments with maturities of one year or less whose carrying values are deemed to approximate fair value. The carrying value of policy loans is deemed to approximate fair value. Separate accounts assets are carried in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at fair value based on quoted market prices.
141 Financial liabilities December31, 2004 December31, 2003 (in millions) Carrying value Fair value Carrying value Fair value Contractholder funds on investment contracts $ 47,173 $ 45,387 $ 39,438 $ 38,022 Short-term debt 43 43 3 3 Long-term debt 5,291 5,601 5,073 5,431 Security repurchase agreements 4,854 4,854 3,749 3,749 Separate Accounts 14,377 14,377 13,425 13,425 Contractholder funds include interest-sensitive life insurance contracts and investment contracts. Interest-sensitive life insurance contracts are not considered financial instruments subject to fair value disclosure requirements. The fair value of investment contracts is based on the terms of the underlying contracts. Fixed annuities are valued at the account balance less surrender charges. Immediate annuities without life contingencies, funding agreements and GICs are valued at the present value of future benefits using current interest rates. Market value adjusted annuities' fair value is estimated to be the market adjusted surrender value. Equity-indexed annuity contracts' fair value approximates carrying value since the embedded equity options are carried at fair value in the consolidated financial statements.
Short-term debt is valued at carrying value due to its short-term nature. The fair value of long-term debt is based on quoted market prices or, in certain cases, is determined using discounted cash flow calculations based on interest rates of comparable instruments. Security repurchase agreements are valued at carrying value due to their short-term nature. Separate accounts liabilities are carried at the fair value of the underlying assets.
142 Derivative financial instruments The Company primarily uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to market risk (principally interest rate, equity price and foreign currency risk), to replicate fixed income securities, and in conjunction with asset/liability management in its Allstate Financial segment. The following table summarizes the notional amount, fair value and carrying value of the Company's derivative financial instruments at December31, 2004.

Fair value and carrying value of the assets and liabilities exclude accrued periodic settlements, which are reported in accrued investment income or other invested assets.
The notional amounts specified in the contracts are used to calculate the exchange of contractual payments under the agreements, and are not representative of the potential for gain or loss on these agreements.
Fair value, which is equal to the carrying value, is the estimated amount that the Company would receive (pay) to terminate the derivative contracts at the reporting date. For exchange traded derivative contracts, the fair value is based on dealer or exchange quotes. The fair value of non-exchange traded derivative contracts, including embedded derivative financial instruments subject to bifurcation, is based on either independent third party pricing sources, including broker quotes, or widely accepted pricing and valuation models which use independent third party data as inputs.
144 The Company manages its exposure to credit risk by utilizing highly rated counterparties, establishing risk control limits, executing legally enforceable master netting agreements and obtaining collateral where appropriate. The Company uses master netting agreements for over-the-counter derivative transactions, including interest rate swap, foreign currency swap, interest rate cap, interest rate floor and credit default swap agreements. These agreements permit either party to net payments due for transactions covered by the agreements. Under the provisions of the agreements, collateral is either pledged or obtained when certain predetermined exposure limits are exceeded. As of December31, 2004, counterparties pledged $490million in cash to the Company under these agreements. To date, the Company has not incurred any losses on derivative financial instruments due to counterparty nonperformance. Other derivatives including futures and certain option contracts are traded on organized exchanges, which require margin deposits and guarantee the execution of trades, thereby mitigating any associated potential credit risk.
Credit exposure represents the Company's potential loss if all of the counterparties failed to perform under the contractual terms of the contracts and all collateral, if any, became worthless. This exposure is measured by the fair value of freestanding derivative contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date reduced by the effect, if any, of master netting agreements.
The following table summarizes the counterparty credit exposure by counterparty credit rating at December31, as it relates to interest rate swap, currency swap, interest rate cap, interest rate floor and replication credit default swap agreements.

(2) For each counterparty, only over-the-counter derivatives with a net positive market value are included.
Market risk is the risk that the Company will incur losses due to adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk exists for all of the derivative financial instruments the Company currently holds, as these instruments may become less valuable due to adverse changes in market conditions. To limit this risk, the Company's senior management has established risk control limits. In addition, changes in fair value of the derivative financial instruments that the Company uses for risk management purposes are generally offset by the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged risk component of the related assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions.
The Company reclassified pretax net gains of $3million and $3million related to cash flow hedges to net income from accumulated other comprehensive income during 2004 and 2003, respectively. At December31, 2004, there is no remaining accumulated other comprehensive income to amortize to net income during 2005.
145 The following table presents information about the nature and accounting treatment of Allstate's primary derivative instruments. Included in the table is a description of the individual derivative instruments, the risk management strategies to which they relate, and the financial statement reporting for the derivative instruments in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Amounts reported are in millions on a pre-tax basis.
Asset/ (Liability) Income/ (Expense) Description, Risk Management Strategy and Financial Statement Reporting Instrument 2004 2003 2004 2003 2002 Interest Rate Contracts: Interest rate swap agreements Description Swap agreements are contracts that periodically exchange the difference between two designated sets of cash flows, (fixed to variable rate, variable to fixed rate, or variable to variable rate) based upon designated market rates or rate indices and a notional amount.
Master netting agreements are used to minimize credit risk. In addition, when applicable, parties are required to post collateral. As of December 31, 2004, the Company pledged to counterparties $1.0 million of securities as collateral for over-the-counter instruments.

12 2 55 Financial futures contracts Description Financial futures contracts are commitments to purchase or sell designated financial instruments at a future date for a specified price or yield. These contracts are traded on organized exchanges and cash settle on a daily basis. The exchange requires margin deposits as well as daily cash settlements of margin. As of December 31, 2004, the Company pledged margin deposits in the form of marketable securities totaling $11 million.
Risk Management Strategies Generally used to manage interest rate risk related to fixed income securities and certain annuity contracts. Financial futures are also used to reduce interest rate risk related to forecasted purchases and sales of marketable investment securities.

(40 ) (26 ) 86 148 Off-balance-sheet financial instruments The contractual amounts and fair values of off-balance-sheet financial instruments at December31 are as follows: 2004 2003 (in millions) Contractual amount Fair value Contractual amount Fair value Commitments to invest $ 836 $  $ 500 $  Private placement commitments 45  49  Commitments to extend mortgage loans 103 1 86 1 Credit guarantees 151  87  Except for credit guarantees, the contractual amounts represent the amount at risk if the contract is fully drawn upon, the counterparty defaults and the value of any underlying security becomes worthless. Unless noted otherwise, the Company does not require collateral or other security to support off-balance-sheet financial instruments with credit risk.
Commitments to invest generally represent commitments to acquire financial interests or instruments. The Company enters into these agreements to allow for additional participation in certain limited partnership investments. Because the equity investments in the limited partnerships are not actively traded, it is not practical to estimate the fair value of these commitments.
Private placement commitments represent conditional commitments to purchase private placement debt and equity securities at a specified future date. The Company regularly enters into these agreements in the normal course of business. The fair value of these commitments generally cannot be estimated on the date the commitment is made as the terms and conditions of the underlying private placement securities are not yet final.
Commitments to extend mortgage loans are agreements to lend to a borrower provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. The Company enters these agreements to commit to future loan fundings at a predetermined interest rate. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Commitments to extend mortgage loans, which are secured by the underlying properties, are valued based on estimates of fees charged by other institutions to make similar commitments to similar borrowers.
Credit guarantees represent conditional commitments included in certain fixed income securities owned by the Company, and exclude those credit guarantees reported as derivatives under SFAS No.133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities". These commitments provide for obligations to exchange credit risk or to forfeit principal due, depending on the nature or occurrence of credit events for the referenced entities. The Company enters into these transactions in order to achieve higher yields than direct investment in referenced entities. The fees for assuming the conditional commitments are reflected in the interest receipts reported in net investment income over the lives of the contracts. The fair value of credit guarantees are estimates of the conditional commitments only and are calculated using quoted market prices or valuation models, which incorporate external market data.
In the event of bankruptcy or other default of the referenced entities, the Company's maximum amount at risk, assuming the value of the referenced credits becomes worthless, is the fair value of the subject fixed income securities, which totaled $151million at December31, 2004. The Company includes the impact of credit guarantees in its analysis of credit risk, and the referenced credits were current to their contractual terms at December31, 2004.
149 7.Reserve for Property-Liability Insurance Claims and Claims Expense As described in Note2, the Company establishes reserves for claims and claims expense on reported and unreported claims of insured losses. These reserve estimates are based on known facts and interpretations of circumstances and internal factors including the Company's experience with similar cases, historical trends involving claim payment patterns, loss payments, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs and product mix. In addition, the reserve estimates are influenced by external factors including law changes, court decisions, changes to regulatory requirements, economic conditions, and public attitudes. The Company, in the normal course of business, may also supplement its claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters, appraisers, engineers, inspectors, other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non-catastrophe related claims. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process.
Because reserves are estimates of losses that have occurred, including incurred but not reported ("IBNR") losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts, which are based on management's best estimates. The Company regularly updates its reserve estimates as new information becomes available and as events unfold that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims. Changes in prior year reserve estimates, which may be material, are reflected in the results of operations in the period such changes are determinable.
Activity in the reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense is summarized as follows: (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Balance at January 1 $ 17,714 $ 16,690 $ 16,500 Less reinsurance recoverables 1,734 1,672 1,667 Net balance at January 1 15,980 15,018 14,833 Incurred claims and claims expense related to: Current year 18,073 17,031 16,972 Prior years (230 ) 401 685 Total incurred 17,843 17,432 17,657 Claims and claims expense paid related to: Current year 10,989 10,195 10,598 Prior years 6,073 6,275 6,874 Total paid 17,062 16,470 17,472 Net balance at December 31 16,761 15,980 15,018 Plus reinsurance recoverables 2,577 1,734 1,672 Balance at December 31 $ 19,338 $ 17,714 $ 16,690 150 Incurred claims and claims expense represents the sum of paid losses and reserve changes in the calendar year. This expense includes losses from catastrophes of $2.47billion, $1.49billion and $731million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2004, losses from catastrophes includes $2.0billion, net of recoveries from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund ("FHCF"), related to Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne (see Note9). This estimate includes net losses in personal lines auto and property policies and net losses on commercial policies. Catastrophes are an inherent risk of the property-liability insurance business that have contributed to, and will continue to contribute to, material year-to-year fluctuations in the Company's results of operations and financial position. The level of catastrophic loss and weather-related losses (wind, hail, lightning, freeze and water losses) experienced in any year cannot be predicted and could be material to results of operations and financial position.
During 2004, incurred claims and claims expense related to prior years was primarily composed of increases to asbestos reserves of $463million, decreases in auto reserves of $657million due to auto injury severity development that was better than expected and late reported loss development that was better than expected due to lower frequency trends in recent years, and decreases in homeowners reserves of $169million due to late reported loss development that was better than expected.
During 2003, incurred claims and claims expense related to prior years was primarily composed of increases to asbestos reserves of $520million and decreases in auto reserves of $221million due to improved auto injury severity development that was better than expected and late reported loss development that was better than expected.
During 2002, incurred claims and claims expense related to prior years was primarily composed of increases to asbestos reserves of $121million and increases in homeowners reserves of $367million primarily as a result of claim severity development and late reported losses greater than the level anticipated in previous reserve estimates.
For further discussion of asbestos and environmental reserves, see Note13.
8.Reserves for Life-Contingent Contract Benefits and Contractholder Funds At December31, the reserve for life-contingent contract benefits consists of the following: (in millions) 2004 2003 Immediate annuities: Structured settlement annuities $ 6,392 $ 5,989 Other immediate annuities 2,414 2,376 Traditional life (1) 2,144 2,340 Other (1) 804 315 Total reserve for life-contingent contract benefits $ 11,754 $ 11,020 (1) In 2004, the Company changed its classification of certain products. As a result, $362million of reserves are classified as Other at December31, 2004 that were previously classified as Traditional life. Prior periods have not been restated.
151 The following table highlights the key assumptions generally used in calculating the reserve for life-contingent contract benefits: Product Mortality Interest rate Estimation method Structured settlement annuities U.S. population with projected calendar year improvements; age setforwards for impaired lives grading to standard Interest rate assumptions range from 4.1% to 11.7% Present value of contractually specified future benefits Other immediate annuities 1983 group annuity mortality table Interest rate assumptions range from 1.9% to 11.5% Present value of expected future benefits based on historical experience Traditional life Actual company experience plus loading Interest rate assumptions range from 4.0% to 11.3% Net level premium reserve method using the Company's withdrawal experience rates Other: Variable annuity guaranteed minimum death benefits 90% of 1994 group annuity reserving table 7% Projected benefit ratio applied to cumulative assessments Accident & health Actual company experience plus loading Unearned premium; additional contract reserves for traditional life To the extent that unrealized gains on fixed income securities would result in a premium deficiency had those gains actually been realized, a premium deficiency reserve has been recorded for certain immediate annuities with life contingencies. A liability of $1.09billion and $932million is included in the reserve for life-contingent contract benefits with respect to this deficiency as of December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The offset to this liability is recorded as a reduction of the unrealized net capital gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income.
At December31, contractholder funds consists of the following: (in millions) 2004 2003 Interest-sensitive life $ 8,280 $ 7,536 Investment contracts: Fixed annuities 34,637 28,783 Guaranteed investment contracts 485 1,066 Funding agreements backing medium-term notes 10,135 7,256 Other investment contracts 1,332 1,624 Allstate Bank deposits 840 806 Total contractholder funds $ 55,709 $ 47,071 152 The following table highlights the key contract provisions relating to contractholder funds: Product Interest rate Withdrawal/Surrender charges Interest-sensitive life Interest rates credited range from 2.0% to 7.25% Either a percentage of account balance or dollar amount grading off generally over 20 years Fixed annuities Interest rates credited range from 1.3% to 11.5% for immediate annuities and 0% to 16% for fixed annuities (which include equity-indexed annuities whose returns are indexed to the S&P 500) Either a declining or a level percentage charge generally over nine years or less. Additionally, approximately 30.5% of fixed annuities are subject to market value adjustment for discretionary withdrawals.
Guaranteed investment contracts Interest rates credited range from 2.95% to 8.14% Generally not subject to discretionary withdrawal Funding agreements backing medium-term notes Interest rates credited range from 2.1% to 7.4% (excluding currency-swapped medium-term notes) Not applicable Other investment contracts: Variable guaranteed minimum income benefit and secondary guarantees on interest- sensitive life and fixed annuities Interest rates used in establishing reserves range from 1.75% to 10.3% Withdrawal and surrender charges are based on the terms of the related interest-sensitive life or fixed annuity contract.
Other investment contracts Interest rates credited range from 2.2% to 2.5% Not applicable Allstate Bank Interest rates credited range from 0% to 5.5% A percentage of principal balance for time deposits withdrawn prior to maturity Contractholder funds include funding agreements held by VIEs issuing medium-term notes. The VIEs are Allstate Life Funding, LLC, Allstate Financial Global Funding, LLC, Allstate Life Global Funding and Allstate Life Global Funding II, and their primary assets are funding agreements used exclusively to back medium-term note programs.
153 Contractholder funds activity for the years ended December31 is as follows: (in millions) 2004 2003 Balance, beginning of year $ 47,071 $ 40,751 Impact of adoption of SOP 03-1 (1) 421  Deposits 13,880 10,627 Interest credited to contractholder funds 1,991 1,846 Benefits and withdrawals (4,167 ) (3,233 ) Maturities of institutional products (2,518 ) (2,163 ) Transfers to Separate Accounts (412 ) (416 ) Contract charges (655 ) (622 ) Fair value adjustments for institutional products 38 131 Other adjustments 60 150 Balance, end of year $ 55,709 $ 47,071 (1) The increase in contractholder funds due to the adoption of SOP 03-1 reflects the reclassification of certain products previously included as a component of separate accounts to contractholder funds, the reclassification of DSI from contractholder funds to other assets and the establishment of reserves for certain liabilities that are primarily related to income benefit guarantees provided under variable annuity contracts and secondary guarantees on interest-sensitive life and certain fixed annuity contracts.
The table below presents information regarding the Company's variable contracts with guarantees. The Company's variable annuity contracts may offer more than one type of guarantee in each contract; therefore, the sum of amounts listed exceeds the total account balances of variable annuity contracts' separate accounts with guarantees.
($ in millions) December31, 2004 In the event of death Account value $ 14,071 Net amount at risk (1) $ 1,900 Average attained age of contractholders 66 years At annuitization Account value $ 3,893 Net amount at risk (2) $ 72 Weighted average waiting period until annuitization options available 7 years Accumulation at specified dates Account value $ 582 Net amount at risk (3) $  Weighted average waiting period until guarantee date 11 years (1) Defined as the estimated current guaranteed minimum death benefit in excess of the current account balance at the balance sheet date.

9.Reinsurance The effects of reinsurance on property-liability premiums written and earned and life and annuity premiums and contract charges for the years ended December31 are as follows: (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Property-liability insurance premiums written Direct $ 25,262 $ 23,649 $ 22,438 Assumed 1,711 1,856 1,822 Ceded (442 ) (318 ) (343 ) Property-liability insurance premiums written, net of reinsurance $ 26,531 $ 25,187 $ 23,917 Property-liability insurance premiums earned Direct $ 24,574 $ 23,132 $ 21,894 Assumed 1,814 1,843 1,804 Ceded (399 ) (298 ) (337 ) Property-liability insurance premiums earned, net of reinsurance $ 25,989 $ 24,677 $ 23,361 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges Direct $ 2,628 $ 2,655 $ 2,645 Assumed 52 134 129 Ceded (608 ) (485 ) (481 ) Life and annuity premiums and contract charges, net of reinsurance $ 2,072 $ 2,304 $ 2,293 Property-liability Total amounts recoverable from reinsurers at December31, 2004 and 2003 were $2.73billion and $1.90billion, respectively. The amounts recoverable from reinsurers at December31, 2004 and 2003 include $150million and $170million, respectively, related to property-liability losses paid by the Company 155 and billed to reinsurers, and $2.58billion and $1.73billion, respectively, estimated by the Company with respect to ceded unpaid losses (including IBNR), which are not billable until the losses are paid.
Reinsurance recoverable from industry pools and facilities on paid and unpaid claims including IBNR at December31, 2004 and 2003 include $831million and $560million, respectively, recoverable from the Michigan Catastrophic Claim Association ("MCCA"). The MCCA established in 1978, is a mandatory reinsurance mechanism for personal injury protection losses over a retention level that increases each MCCA fiscal year. The retention levels are $325 thousand per claim and $350thousand per claim for the fiscal years ending June30, 2004 and 2005, respectively. The MCCA is funded by assessments from member companies who, in turn, can recover the assessment from policyholders.
The Company purchases reinsurance after evaluating the financial condition of the reinsurer, as well as the terms and price of coverage. Developments in the insurance industry have fostered a movement to segregate environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities with dedicated capital. Regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported these actions. The Company is unable to determine the impact, if any, that these developments will have on the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables in the future. Reinsurance recoverables from asbestos and environmental and other reinsurers include $236million and $112million of recoverables from Lloyd's of London at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Lloyd's of London implemented a restructuring plan in 1996 to solidify its capital base and to segregate claims for years prior to 1993. In addition, efforts have been recently made by Lloyd's of London to impose increased documentation standards on reinsurance claims. The impact, if any, of the restructuring and related actions on the collectibility of the recoverable from Lloyd's of London is uncertain at this time. The recoverable from Lloyd's of London syndicates is spread among thousands of investors who have unlimited liability.
Estimates of gross qualifying personal property losses for Charley, Frances and Ivan exceed the $312million per occurrence FHCF retention, thus permitting 90% reimbursement of qualifying losses up to an estimated maximum total for this season of $991million. Reinsurance recoverables at December31, 2004 include $486million recoverable from the FHCF for qualifying property losses related to these hurricanes. There was no reinsurance recoverable outstanding from the FHCF at December31, 2003. In the event of a qualifying catastrophe in the 2005 hurricane season, the Company also has access to reimbursement provided by the FHCF for 90% of hurricane losses in excess of approximately the first $342million for each storm, up to an aggregate of $985million (90% of approximately $1,094million) in a single hurricane season, and $1.97billion total reimbursement over two hurricane seasons.
In 2004, Allstate Floridian Insurance Company ("Floridian") entered into two reinsurance contracts to cover losses from future catastrophic events in the state of Florida through May2005. Allstate Protection also entered into several three-year cancellable excess of loss reinsurance contracts in 2004 through broker transactions to reinsure personal property losses for business written in certain states. There were no reinsurance recoverables outstanding from these reinsurers at December31, 2004.
In connection with the Company's acquisition of the personal lines auto and homeowners business ("Encompass") of CNA Financial Corporation ("CNA") in 1999, Allstate and Continental Casualty Company ("Continental"), a subsidiary of CNA, entered into a four-year aggregate stop loss reinsurance agreement. In connection with this reinsurance agreement, the Company had reinsurance recoverables from Continental on paid and unpaid losses of $190million as of December31, 2003. There was no amount outstanding in connection with this agreement at December31, 2004. Additionally, in connection with the sale of the Company's reinsurance business to SCOR U.S. Corporation in 1996, the Company entered into a reinsurance agreement for the associated post-1984 reinsurance liabilities.
With the exception of industry pools and facilities and the recoverable balances from Lloyd's of London, FHCF and Continental discussed above, the largest reinsurance recoverable balance the 156 Company had outstanding was $87million from Employers' Reinsurance Company at both December31, 2004 and 2003. No other amount due or estimated to be due from any single property-liability reinsurer was in excess of $52million and $57million at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was $230million and $101million at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and is primarily related to the Company's discontinued lines and coverages segment. There were $9million and $1million of deductions related to previous year provisions in 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Allstate Financial The Company's Allstate Financial segment reinsures certain of its risks to other insurers primarily under yearly renewable term, coinsurance, and coinsurance with funds withheld agreements .
These agreements result in a passing of the agreed-upon percentage of risk to the reinsurer in exchange for negotiated reinsurance premium payments. Coinsurance with funds withheld is similar to coinsurance except that the cash and investments that support the liability for contract benefits are not transferred to the assuming company and settlements are made on a net basis between the companies. Allstate Financial cedes 100% of the morbidity risk on its long-term care contracts. Allstate Financial ceded specified percentages of the mortality risk on certain life policies, depending upon the issue date and product, to a pool of thirteen unaffiliated reinsurers. Since November1998, Allstate Financial ceded mortality risk on new life contracts that exceeded $2million per life for individual coverage. For business sold prior to October1998, Allstate Financial ceded mortality risk in excess of specific amounts up to $1million per life for individual coverage. Also, on certain in-force variable annuity contracts Allstate Financial cedes 100% of the mortality and certain other risks related to product features.
In addition, Allstate Financial has used reinsurance to effect the acquisition or disposition of certain blocks of business. As of December31, 2004, Allstate Financial ceded $169million to subsidiaries of Citigroup and Scottish Re (U.S.)Inc. in connection with the disposition of substantially all of the direct response distribution business (see Note3).
As of December31, 2004, the gross life insurance in force was $431.60billion of which $210.01billion was ceded to the unaffiliated reinsurers.
Reinsurance recoverables at December31 are summarized in the following table.
Reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid claims (in millions) 2004 2003 Life insurance $ 1,010 $ 836 Long-term care 315 180 Other 271 201 Total Allstate Financial $ 1,596 $ 1,217 At December31, 2004 and 2003, approximately 81% and 97%, respectively, of reinsurance recoverables are due from companies rated A- or better by S&P.
157 10.Deferred Policy Acquisition and Sales Inducement Costs Deferred policy acquisition costs for the years ended December31 are as follows: 2004 (in millions) Allstate Financial Property- Liability Total Balance, beginning of year $ 3,517 $ 1,325 $ 4,842 Impact of adoption of SOP 03-1 (1) (134 )  (134 ) Disposition of operation (2) (238 )  (238 ) Acquisition costs deferred 918 4,009 4,927 Amortization charged to income (591 ) (3,874 ) (4,465 ) Effect of unrealized gains and losses 36  36 Balance, end of year $ 3,508 $ 1,460 $ 4,968 2003 (in millions) Allstate Financial Property- Liability Total Balance, beginning of year $ 3,205 $ 1,180 $ 4,385 Acquisition costs deferred 816 3,665 4,481 Amortization charged to income (538 ) (3,520 ) (4,058 ) Effect of unrealized gains and losses 34  34 Balance, end of year $ 3,517 $ 1,325 $ 4,842 2002 (in millions) Allstate Financial Property- Liability Total Balance, beginning of year $ 3,286 $ 1,135 $ 4,421 Acquisition costs deferred 742 3,261 4,003 Amortization charged to income (478 ) (3,216 ) (3,694 ) Effect of unrealized gains and losses (345 )  (345 ) Balance, end of year $ 3,205 $ 1,180 $ 4,385 (1) The impact of adoption of SOP 03-1 includes a write-down in variable annuity DAC of $108million, the reclassification of DSI from DAC to other assets resulting in a decrease to DAC of $44million, an increase to DAC of $8million for an adjustment to the effect of unrealized capital gains and losses and the reclassification of unearned revenue from DAC to contractholder funds resulting in an increase to DAC of $10million (see Note2).
(2) In 2004, DAC was reduced by $238million related to the disposition of substantially all of Allstate Financial's direct response distribution business (see Note3).
Amortization charged to income includes $120million, $46million and $2million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, due to realized capital gains and losses.
158 In 2004, DSI and related amortization is classified within the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and Operations as other assets and interest credited to contractholder funds, respectively. Deferred sales inducement activity for Allstate Financial for the twelve months ended December31, 2004 was as follows: (in millions) Balance, January1, 2004 (1) $ 99 Sales inducements deferred 55 Amortization charged to income (45 ) Effects of unrealized gains and losses 25 Balance, December31, 2004 $ 134 (1) The January1, 2004 balance includes a $16million write-down of DSI due to the adoption of SOP 03-1 (see Note2).
11.Capital Structure Debt outstanding Total debt outstanding at December31 consisted of the following: (in millions) 2004 2003 7.875% Senior Notes, due 2005 (1) $ 900 $ 902 5.375% Senior Notes, due 2006 (1) 540 545 7.20% Senior Notes, due 2009 (1) 750 750 6.125% Senior Notes, due 2012 (1) 350 350 5.00% Senior Notes, due 2014 (1) 650  6.125% Senior Notes, due 2032 (1) 250 250 5.350% Senior Notes, due 2033 (1) 400 400 7.83% Junior Subordinated Debentures, due 2045, callable 200 200 7.50% Debentures, due 2013 250 250 6.75% Senior Debentures, due 2018 250 250 6.90% Senior Debentures, due 2038 250 250 Synthetic lease VIE obligations, floating rates, due 2006 117 112 Investment management VIE obligations, floating rates, due 2013 279 691 Structured investment security VIE obligations, due 2007 47 45 Floating rate notes, due 2012 to 2017, callable 57 77 Other various notes, due 2008 1 1 Total long-term debt 5,291 5,073 Short-term debt (2) 43 3 Total debt $ 5,334 $ 5,076 (1) Senior Notes are subject to redemption at the Company's option in whole or in part at any time at the greater of either 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date or the discounted sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.
(2) The Company classifies any borrowings which have a maturity of twelve months or less at inception as short-term debt.
159 Total debt outstanding by maturity at December31 consisted of the following: (in millions) 2004 2003 Due within one year or less $ 943 $ 3 Due after one year through 5years 1,455 1,605 Due after 5 years through 10years 1,541 2,064 Due after 10 years through 20years 295 304 Due after 20 years 1,100 1,100 Total debt $ 5,334 $ 5,076 In 2004, the Company issued $650million of 5.00% senior notes due 2014, the net proceeds of which will be used for general corporate purposes, including to facilitate the repayment of a portion of the $900million of 7.875% senior notes due 2005 at their scheduled maturity on May1, 2005.
In 2003, the Company issued $400million of 5.350% senior notes due 2033, the net proceeds of which were used to redeem the $300million of 6.75% notes due in 2003 and for general corporate purposes.
In 1996, the Company issued junior subordinated debentures to Allstate Financing II ("AF II"), a VIE, which used the junior subordinated debentures as collateral to issue $200million of 7.83% mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust ("trust preferred securities") to unrelated third party investors. Pursuant to the adoption of FIN46 on July1, 2003, the Company is not required to consolidate the VIE because the Company owns none of the variable interests issued by the VIE. AFII issued 200,000 shares of trust preferred securities at $1,000 per share. The sole assets of AFII are junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company. The junior subordinated debentures held by AFII will mature on December1, 2045 and are redeemable by the Company at a liquidation value of $1,039 per share in whole or in part beginning on December1, 2006, at which time the trust preferred securities are callable. The liquidation value per share gradually declines each year and remains at a liquidation value of $1,000 per share on December1, 2016. Dividends on the trust preferred securities are cumulative, payable semi-annually in arrears, and are deferrable at the Company's option for up to 5years. The obligations of the Company with respect to the junior subordinated debentures and related instruments constitute full and unconditional guarantees by the Company of AFII's obligations under the trust preferred securities, including the payment of the liquidation or redemption price and any accumulated and unpaid interest and yield enhancements, but only to the extent of funds held by the trust.
Allstate will be prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock and any preferred stock that it may issue, or repurchasing capital stock if the Company elects to defer dividend payments on these preferred securities. Dividends on the preferred securities have been reported as interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the twelve months of 2004 and the last six months of 2003, and were classified as minority interest and reported as dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trust in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during 2002 and the first six months of 2003.
Pursuant to the adoption of FIN 46 in 2003, the Company is the primary beneficiary of a consolidated VIE used to acquire a headquarters office building and up to 38 automotive collision repair stores ("synthetic lease VIE"). The Company's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include $117million and $112million of property and equipment, net, and long-term debt as of December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Beginning July1, 2003, payments previously reported as operating costs and expenses are classified as interest expense.
As of December31, 2003, the Company was also the primary beneficiary of two previously unconsolidated investment management VIEs and, as a result of consolidation pursuant to FIN46R, the 160 Company recognized a cumulative effect adjustment gain of approximately $3million, after-tax, in 2003. In February2004, the Company disposed of a portion of its equity investment in one of the consolidated investment management VIEs, which resulted in deconsolidation of that VIE in the first quarter of 2004 (see Note3). The Company's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include $304million and $725million of assets ($296million and $663million of which are classified as investments) and long-term debt of $279million and $691million as of December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Despite the consolidation of the debt issued by the investment management VIEs, those investors have no recourse to the equity of the Company as the sole source of payment of the liabilities is the assets of the investment management VIEs. Allstate's maximum loss exposure related to its investment in the investment management VIEs is the current carrying value of its equity investment, which totaled $11million and $12million at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The Company is also the primary beneficiary of a consolidated structured investment security VIE. The Company's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include $54million and $53million of investments and long term debt of $47million and $45million as of December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The holders of the consolidated long-term debt have no recourse to the equity of the Company as the sole source of payment is the assets of the VIE.
To manage short-term liquidity, Allstate can issue commercial paper, draw on its credit facilities, and engage in securities repurchase and resale agreements (see Note2). The Company currently maintains two credit facilities as a potential source of funds for The Allstate Corporation, AIC and ALIC. These include a $1billion five-year revolving line of credit expiring in 2009 and a $50million one-year revolving line of credit expiring in 2005. The five-year facility contains an increase provision that would make up to an additional $500million available for borrowing provided the increased portion could be fully syndicated at a later date among existing or new lenders. The right to borrow from the five-year facility is subject to a requirement to maintain a 37.5% debt to capital resources ratio as defined in the agreements. Although the right to borrow under the five-year facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement, the costs of maintaining the five-year facility and borrowing under it are based on the ratings of our senior, unsecured, nonguaranteed long-term debt. No amounts were outstanding under any of these lines of credit during 2004 and 2003. The Company had $43million of commercial paper outstanding at December31, 2004 with a weighted average interest rate of 2.22% and no outstanding balance as of December31, 2003. The Company paid $301million, $269million and $269million of interest on debt in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
At December31, 2004, the Company may issue up to an additional $2.15billion of debt securities, equity securities, warrants for debt and equity securities, trust preferred securities, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units under the $2.80billion shelf registration filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2003.
Capital stock The Company had 900million shares of issued common stock of which 683million were outstanding and 217million were held in treasury as of December31, 2004. In 2004, the Company repurchased 29.4million shares at an average cost of $46.78.
Shareholder rights agreement In 2003, the Company terminated its Shareholder Rights Agreement and redeemed the "Rights" at a price of $0.01 per Right (approximately $7million), which was paid on January2, 2004. The Rights Agreement, under which all shareholders received a dividend distribution of one Right on each outstanding share of the Company's common stock, would have expired on February12, 2009.
161 12.Company Restructuring Restructuring and related charges include employee termination and relocation benefits, post-exit rent expenses, and a non-cash charge resulting from pension benefit payments made to agents in connection with the 1999 reorganization of Allstate's multiple agency programs to a single exclusive agency program.
In 2003, the Company completed the restructuring program initiated in 2001 to improve the efficiency of its claims handling and certain other back-office processes primarily through a consolidation and reconfiguration of field claim offices, customer information centers and satellite offices ("2001 program"). The 2001 program resulted in a reduction of the total number of field claim offices and an increase in the average size of individual claim offices. In addition, two customer information centers and two satellite offices were closed. As part of the 2001 program, employees working in facilities selected for closure were given the option to either relocate or collect severance benefits. The Company realized approximately $175million of annual pre-tax expense savings as a result of implementing the 2001 program.
In addition, the Company undertakes various initiatives to reduce expenses and/or increase productivity ("other programs"). The other programs generally involve a reduction in staffing levels, and in certain cases, office closures.
The following table illustrates the inception to date change in the restructuring liability at December31, 2004: (in millions) Employee costs Exit costs Total liability 2001 program: 2001 program liability at inception $ 17 $ 79 $ 96 Net adjustments to liability 5 (8 ) (3 ) Payments applied against the liability (22 ) (69 ) (91 ) 2001 program liability at December 31, 2004  2 2 Other programs: Other programs liability at inception 35 17 52 Payments applied against the liability (21 ) (10 ) (31 ) Other programs liability at December 31, 2004 14 7 21 Balance at December 31, 2004 $ 14 $ 9 $ 23 In 2004, the Company eliminated the remaining $10million of an accrual established in prior years for post-exit rent expenses as a result of the Company's ability to occupy the previously vacant leased space for the remainder of the lease term.
The payments applied against the liability for employee costs primarily reflect severance costs, and the payments for exit costs generally consist of post-exit rent expenses and contract termination penalties.
13.Commitments, Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities Leases The Company leases certain office facilities and computer equipment. Total rent expense for all leases was $367million, $367million and $425million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
162 Minimum rental commitments under noncancelable capital and operating leases with an initial or remaining term of more than one year as of December31, 2004 are as follows: (in millions) Capital leases Operating leases 2005 $ 2 $ 220 2006 2 163 2007 2 116 2008 2 85 2009 2 70 Thereafter 24 162 $ 34 $ 816 Present value of minimum lease payments $ 18 California Earthquake Authority Exposure to certain potential losses from earthquakes in California is limited by the Company's participation in the California Earthquake Authority ("CEA"), which provides insurance for California earthquake losses. The CEA is a privately-financed, publicly-managed state agency created to provide insurance coverage for earthquake damage. Insurers selling homeowners insurance in California are required to offer earthquake insurance to their customers either through their company or by participation in the CEA. The Company's homeowners policies continue to include coverages for losses caused by explosions, theft, glass breakage and fires following an earthquake, which are not underwritten by the CEA.
Should losses arising from an earthquake cause a deficit in the CEA, additional funding would be obtained through assessments on participating insurance companies and reinsurance proceeds. Participating insurers are required to pay an assessment, currently estimated not to exceed $2.18billion, if the capital of the CEA falls below $350million. Participating insurers are required to pay a second assessment, currently estimated not to exceed $1.46billion, if aggregate CEA earthquake losses exceed $5.14billion and the capital of the CEA falls below $350million. At December31, 2004, the CEA's capital balance was approximately $1.81billion. If the CEA assesses its member insurers for any amount, the amount of future assessments on members is reduced by the amounts previously assessed. To date, the only assessment made by the CEA has been its initial assessment paid by participating insurers beginning in 1996. The authority of the CEA to assess participating insurers for the first assessment expires when it has completed twelve years of operation, at year-end 2008. All future assessments on participating CEA insurers are based on their CEA insurance market share as of December31 of the preceding year. As of December31, 2003, the Company's share of the CEA was 23%. Allstate does not expect its CEA market share to materially change. At this level, the Company's maximum possible CEA assessment would be $830million. However, Allstate does not expect its portion of these additional contingent assessments, if any, to exceed $498million, its share of the first assessment. This is based on the low likelihood of an event exceeding the CEA claims paying capacity of $5.14billion, and therefore the need for a second assessment is remote. Management believes Allstate's exposure to earthquake losses in California has been significantly reduced as a result of its participation in the CEA.
Florida hurricane assessments Floridian and Allstate Floridian Indemnity Company ("AFI") sell and service Allstate's Florida residential property policies and have access to reimbursements on certain qualifying Florida hurricane 163 losses (see Note9), as well as exposure to assessments from the FHCF. The FHCF has the authority to issue bonds to pay its obligations to participating insurers in excess of its capital balances, which are funded by assessments on all property and casualty premiums in the state, except workers' compensation, medical malpractice and accident and health insurance. By law, these assessments are the obligation of insurance policyholders, which insurance companies must collect. The FHCF assessments are limited to 6% of premiums per year beginning the first year in which reimbursements require bonding, and up to a total of 10% of premiums per year for assessments in the second and subsequent years, if required to fund additional bonding. Upon the order of the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation ("FLOIR"), companies are required to collect the FHCF assessments directly from residential property policyholders and remit them to the FHCF as they are collected.
In addition, Floridian and AFI are subject to assessments from Citizens Property Insurance Corporation ("Citizens"), which was created by the state of Florida to provide insurance to property owners unable to obtain coverage in the private insurance market. Citizens, at the discretion and direction of its Board of Directors, can levy a Regular Assessment on participating companies for a deficit in any calendar year equal to the greater of 10% of the deficit or 10% of Florida property premiums industry-wide for the prior year. An insurer may recoup a Regular Assessment through a surcharge to policyholders subject to a cap on the amount that can be charged in any one year. A rate filing or any portion of a rate change attributable entirely to an assessment is subject to the FLOIR's statutory authority to review the "adequacy" of any rate at any time. If a deficit remains after the Regular Assessment, Citizens can also fund the remaining deficit by issuing bonds. The costs of these bonds are then funded through Emergency Assessments in subsequent years. Companies are required to collect the Emergency Assessments directly from residential property policyholders and remit them to Citizens as they are collected. Participating companies are obligated to purchase any unsold bonds issued by Citizens. In order to recoup its Citizens assessment, an insurer must file for a policy surcharge with the FLOIR at least 15days prior to imposing the surcharge on policies.
While facilities such as the FHCF and Citizens are designed so that the ultimate cost is borne by policyholders, the exposure to assessments and the availability of recoveries from these facilities may not offset each other. Moreover, even if they do offset each other, they may not offset each other in the same fiscal period's financial statements. This would be due to the ultimate timing of the assessments and recoupments, as well as the possibility of policies not being renewed in subsequent years. Citizens is expected to report higher losses from the hurricanes that struck Florida in the third quarter of 2004. Its Board of Directors is meeting in March2005 to review its financial condition and determine if it will assess the industry.
Other hurricane exposure The Company has also mitigated its ultimate exposure to hurricanes by placing insurance coverage with a third party; examples include insurance coverage in areas of Florida where Floridian and AFI do not write homeowners insurance and in Hawaii for hurricane insurance coverage to a non-affiliated company.
Shared markets As a condition of maintaining its licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states, the Company is required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Underwriting results related to these arrangements, which tend to be adverse, have been immaterial to the results of operations.
164 Guaranty funds Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. The Company's policy is to accrue assessments as the related written premium upon which the assessment is based is written. The Company's expenses related to these funds have totaled $58million, $61million and $38million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
PMI runoff support agreement The Company has certain limited rights and obligations under a capital support agreement ("Runoff Support Agreement") with PMI Mortgage Insurance Company ("PMI"), the primary operating subsidiary of PMI Group. Under the Runoff Support Agreement, the Company would be required to pay claims on PMI policies written prior to October28, 1994 if PMI fails certain financial covenants and fails to pay such claims. In the event any amounts are so paid, the Company would receive a commensurate amount of preferred stock or subordinated debt of PMI Group or PMI. The Runoff Support Agreement also restricts PMI's ability to write new business and pay dividends under certain circumstances. Management does not believe this agreement will have a material adverse effect on results of operations, liquidity or financial position of the Company.
Guarantees The Company provides residual value guarantees on Company leased automobiles. If all outstanding leases were terminated effective December31, 2004, the Company's maximum obligation pursuant to these guarantees, assuming the automobiles have no residual value, would be $19million at December31, 2004. The remaining term of each residual value guarantee is equal to the term of the underlying lease that range from less than one year to three years. Historically, the Company has not made any material payments pursuant to these guarantees.
The Company owns certain fixed income securities that obligate the Company to exchange credit risk or to forfeit principal due, depending on the nature or occurrence of specified credit events for the referenced entities. In the event all such specified credit events were to occur, the Company's maximum amount at risk on these fixed income securities, as measured by their par value was $151million at December31, 2004. The obligations associated with these fixed income securities expire at various times during the next seven years.
Lincoln Benefit Life Company ("LBL"), a wholly owned subsidiary of ALIC, has issued universal life insurance contracts to third parties who finance the premium payments on the universal life insurance contracts through a commercial paper program. LBL has issued a repayment guarantee on the outstanding commercial paper balance that is fully collateralized by the cash surrender value of the universal life insurance contracts. At December31, 2004, the amount due under the commercial paper program is $301million and the cash surrender value of the policies is $305million. The repayment guarantee expires April30, 2006.
In the normal course of business, the Company provides standard indemnifications to counterparties in contracts in connection with numerous transactions, including acquisitions and divestitures. The types of indemnifications typically provided include indemnifications for breaches of representations and warranties, taxes and certain other liabilities, such as third party lawsuits. The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and were entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. The terms of the indemnifications vary in duration and nature. In many cases, the maximum obligation is not explicitly stated and the contingencies triggering 165 the obligation to indemnify have not occurred and are not expected to occur. Consequently, the maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnifications is not determinable. Historically, the Company has not made any material payments pursuant to these obligations.
The aggregate liability balance related to all guarantees was not material as of December31, 2004.
Regulation The Company is subject to changing social, economic and regulatory conditions. Recent state and federal regulatory initiatives and proceedings have included efforts to influence and restrict premium rates in a manner adverse to insurers, restrict the ability of insurers to cancel policies, limit insurers' ability to impose underwriting standards, impose additional regulations regarding agent and broker compensation and otherwise expand overall regulation of insurance products and the insurance industry. The ultimate changes and eventual effects of these initiatives on the Company's business, if any, are uncertain.
Regulatory bodies have contacted various subsidiaries of the Company and have requested information relating to variable insurance products, including such areas as market timing and late trading and sales practices. The Company believes that these inquiries are similar to those made to many financial services companies as part of an industry-wide investigation by various regulatory agencies into the practices, policies and procedures relating to variable insurance products sales and subaccount trading practices. The various subsidiaries of the Company have and will continue to respond to these information requests and investigations. The Company at the present time is not aware of any systemic problems with respect to such matters that may have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position.
Legal proceedings Background The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits and other legal proceedings arising out of various aspects of its business. As background to the "Proceedings" sub-section below, please note the following:  These matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties and complexities, including but not limited to, the underlying facts of each matter, novel legal issues, variations between jurisdictions in which matters are being litigated, differences in applicable laws and judicial interpretations, the length of time before many of these matters might be resolved by settlement or through litigation and, in some cases, the timing of their resolutions relative to other similar cases brought against other companies, the fact that many of these matters are putative class actions in which a class has not been certified and in which the purported class may not be clearly defined, the fact that many of these matters involve multi-state class actions in which the applicable law(s) for the claims at issue is in dispute and therefore unclear, and the current challenging legal environment faced by large corporations and insurance companies.
In these matters, plaintiffs seek a variety of remedies including equitable relief in the form of injunctive and other remedies and monetary relief in the form of contractual and extra-contractual damages. In some cases, the monetary damages sought include punitive or treble damages or are not specified. Often more specific information beyond the type of relief sought is not available because plaintiffs have not requested more specific relief in their court pleadings. In those cases where plaintiffs have made a specific demand for monetary damages, they often specify damages just below a jurisdictional limit regardless of the facts of the case. This represents the maximum 166 they can seek without risking removal from state court to federal court. In our experience, monetary demands in plaintiffs' court pleadings bear little relation to the ultimate loss, if any, to the Company.
For the reasons specified above, it is not possible to make meaningful estimates of the amount or range of loss that could result from these matters at this time. The Company reviews these matters on an on-going basis and follows the provisions of SFAS No.5, "Accounting for Contingencies" when making accrual and disclosure decisions. When assessing reasonably possible and probable outcomes, the Company bases its decisions on its assessment of the ultimate outcome following all appeals.
In the opinion of the Company's management, while some of these matters may be material to the Company's operating results for any particular period if an unfavorable outcome results, none will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company.
Proceedings There are two active nationwide class action lawsuits against Allstate regarding its specification of after-market (non-original equipment manufacturer) replacement parts in the repair of insured vehicles. One of these suits alleges that the specification of such parts constitutes breach of contract and fraud, and this suit mirrors to a large degree lawsuits filed against other carriers in the industry. These plaintiffs allege that after-market parts are not "of like kind and quality" as required by the insurance policy, and they are seeking actual and punitive damages. The Company has been vigorously defending this lawsuit, but its outcome is uncertain. In the second lawsuit, plaintiffs allege that Allstate and three co-defendants have violated federal antitrust laws by conspiring to manipulate the price of auto physical damage coverages in such a way that not all savings realized by the use of aftermarket parts are passed on to the policyholders. These plaintiffs seek actual and treble damages. In November2002, a nationwide class was certified in this case. The defendants filed a petition to appeal the class certification. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals did not reach the question of class certification, but ruled in favor of the defendants and ordered the lower court to dismiss the case on the grounds that under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, the defendants' alleged actions are not covered by the federal antitrust laws. The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied by the court on January25, 2005. The Company is awaiting further actions, if any, by the plaintiffs.
There are several statewide and nationwide class action lawsuits pending against Allstate alleging that its failure to pay "inherent diminished value" to insureds under the collision, comprehensive, uninsured motorist property damage, or auto property damage liability provisions of auto policies constitutes breach of contract and fraud. Plaintiffs define "inherent diminished value" as the difference between the market value of the insured automobile before an accident and the market value after repair. Plaintiffs allege that they are entitled to the payment of inherent diminished value under the terms of the policy. To a large degree, these lawsuits mirror similar lawsuits filed against other carriers in the industry. These lawsuits are pending in various state and federal courts, and they are in various stages of development. Classes have been certified in only two cases. Both are multi-state class actions. A trial in one of these multi-state class action cases involving collision and comprehensive coverage concluded on April29, 2004, with a jury verdict in favor of the Company. The plaintiffs made a motion for a new trial, which was denied, and have now filed an appeal from the judgment. In the other certified class action lawsuit, which involves uninsured motorist property damage coverage, the appellate court has granted the Company's petition for review of the order of certification. The Company has been vigorously defending all of these lawsuits and, since 1998, has been implementing policy language in more than 40 states 167 reaffirming that its collision and comprehensive coverages do not include diminished value claims. The outcome of these disputes remains uncertain.
There are a number of state and nationwide class action lawsuits pending in various state courts challenging the legal propriety of Allstate's medical bill review processes on a number of grounds, including, among other things, the manner in which Allstate determines reasonableness and necessity. One nationwide class action has been certified. These lawsuits, which to a large degree mirror similar lawsuits filed against other carriers in the industry, allege these processes result in a breach of the insurance policy as well as fraud. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages in the form of contractual and extra-contractual damages. The Company denies those allegations and has been vigorously defending these lawsuits. The outcome of these disputes is currently uncertain.
A number of nationwide and statewide putative class actions are pending against Allstate, which challenge Allstate's use of certain automated database vendors in valuing total loss automobiles. To a large degree, these lawsuits mirror similar lawsuits filed against other carriers in the industry. Plaintiffs allege that flaws in these databases result in valuations to the detriment of insureds. The plaintiffs are seeking actual and punitive damages. The lawsuits are in various stages of development and Allstate has been vigorously defending them, but the outcome of these disputes is currently uncertain.
The Company is defending a putative nationwide class action that alleges that the Company discriminates against non-Caucasian policyholders, through underwriting and rate-making practices including the use of credit by charging them higher premiums. The plaintiffs seek both monetary relief, in the form of actual and punitive damages, and equitable relief, in the form of injunctive and other remedies. The Company is also defending a putative statewide class action challenging its use of credit under certain state insurance statutes. These plaintiffs seek monetary and equitable relief. The Company removed the case to Federal Court. Plaintiff's motion to remand to state court was denied and is now being appealed. The Company denies these allegations and has been vigorously defending these lawsuits. The outcome of these disputes is currently uncertain.
Allstate is defending various lawsuits involving worker classification issues. These lawsuits include a number of putative class actions and one certified class action challenging the overtime exemption claimed by the Company under the Fair Labor Standards Act or state wage and hour laws. In the one certified class action, the trial court has found Allstate liable and the case will proceed to trial on damages. In these cases, Plaintiffs seek monetary relief, such as penalties and liquidated damages, and non-monetary relief, such as injunctive relief and an accounting. These class actions mirror similar lawsuits filed recently against other carriers in the industry and other employers. A putative nationwide class action filed by former employee agents also includes a worker classification issue; these agents are challenging certain amendments to the Agents Pension Plan and are seeking to have exclusive agent independent contractors treated as employees for benefit purposes. This matter was dismissed with prejudice in late March2004 by the trial court but is the subject of further proceedings on appeal. Allstate has been vigorously defending these and various other worker classification lawsuits. The outcome of these disputes is currently uncertain.
The Company is defending certain matters relating to the Company's agency program reorganization announced in 1999. These matters include a lawsuit filed in December2001 by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") alleging retaliation under federal civil rights laws, a class action filed in August2001 by former employee agents alleging retaliation and age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, breach of contract and ERISA violations, and a lawsuit filed in October2004 by the EEOC alleging age discrimination with respect to a policy limiting the rehire of agents affected by the agency program reorganization. The Company is also defending another action, in which a class was certified in June2004, filed by former employee agents who terminated their employment prior to the agency program reorganization. These plaintiffs have asserted claims under 168 ERISA and for constructive discharge, and are seeking the benefits provided in connection with the reorganization. In late March2004, in the first EEOC lawsuit and class action lawsuit, the trial court issued a memorandum and order that, among other things, certified classes of agents, including a mandatory class of agents who had signed a release, for purposes of effecting the court's declaratory judgment that the release is voidable at the option of the release signer. The court also ordered that an agent who voids the release must return to Allstate "any and all benefits received by the [agent] in exchange for signing the release." The court also "concluded that, on the undisputed facts of record, there is no basis for claims of age discrimination." The EEOC and plaintiffs have asked the court to clarify and/or reconsider its memorandum and order. The case otherwise remains pending. A putative nationwide class action has also been filed by former employee agents alleging various violations of ERISA. This matter was dismissed with prejudice in late March2004 by the trial court but is the subject of further proceedings on appeal. In these matters, plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages, and equitable relief. Allstate has been vigorously defending these lawsuits and other matters related to its agency program reorganization. In addition, Allstate is defending certain matters relating to its life agency program reorganization announced in 2000. These matters include an investigation by the EEOC with respect to allegations of age discrimination and retaliation. Allstate is cooperating with the agency investigation and will continue to vigorously defend these and other claims related to the life agency program reorganization. The outcome of these disputes is currently uncertain.
The Company is defending a number of lawsuits brought by plaintiffs challenging trading restrictions the Company adopted in an effort to limit market-timing activity in its variable annuity sub-accounts. In one case, plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on their breach of contract claims was granted and the matter will proceed to trial on damages. In these various lawsuits, plaintiffs seek a variety of remedies including monetary and equitable relief. The Company has been vigorously defending these matters, but their outcome is currently uncertain.
Other Matters The Company and some of its agents and subsidiaries have received interrogatories and demands to produce information from several regulatory and enforcement authorities. These authorities are seeking information relevant to on-going investigations into the possible violation of antitrust or insurance laws by unnamed parties and, in particular, are seeking information as to whether any person engaged in activities for the purpose of price fixing, market allocation, or bid rigging. Published press reports have indicated that numerous demands of this nature have been sent to insurance companies as part of industry-wide investigations. The Company has cooperated and intends to continue to cooperate with these and any similar requests for information.
Various other legal and regulatory actions are currently pending that involve the Company and specific aspects of its conduct of business. Like other members of the insurance industry, the Company is the target of a number of class action lawsuits and other types of litigation, some of which involve claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts. This litigation is based on a variety of issues and targets a range of the Company's practices. The outcome of these disputes is currently unpredictable. However, at this time, based on their present status, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate liability, if any, in one or more of these other actions in excess of amounts currently reserved is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations, liquidity or financial position of the Company.
169 Asbestos and environmental Establishing net loss reserves for asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other types of claims. Among the complications are lack of historical data, long reporting delays, uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure, unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage, unresolved legal issues regarding the determination, availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits, evolving and expanding theories of liability, availability and collectibility of recoveries from reinsurance, retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements, and estimating the extent and timing of any contractual liability, and other uncertainties. There are complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered, or were ever intended to be covered, and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage; what types of losses are covered; whether there is an insurer obligation to defend; how policy limits are determined; how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted; and whether clean-up costs represent insured property damage. Management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future, and the ultimate cost may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in an increase in loss reserves.
Allstate's reserves for asbestos claims were $1.46billion and $1.08billion, net of reinsurance recoverables of $963million and $504million at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Reserves for environmental claims were $232million and $257million, net of reinsurance recoverables of $49million and $58million at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Approximately 62% and 60% of the total net asbestos and environmental reserves at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were for incurred but not reported estimated losses.
Management believes its net loss reserves for environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws and regulations. However, due to the inconsistencies of court coverage decisions, unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage, unresolved legal issues regarding the determination, availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits, plaintiffs' evolving and expanded theories of liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, availability and collectibility of recoveries from reinsurance, retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements, and estimating the extent and timing of any contractual liability, and other uncertainties, the ultimate cost of these claims may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded, resulting in an increase in loss reserves. In addition, while the Company believes that improved actuarial techniques and databases have assisted in its ability to estimate asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines net loss reserves, these refinements may subsequently prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable losses. Due to the uncertainties and factors described above, management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be required.
14.Income Taxes The Company and its eligible domestic subsidiaries filea consolidated federal income tax return. Tax liabilities and benefits realized by the consolidated group are allocated as generated by the respective entities. Tax liabilities and benefits of ineligible domestic subsidiaries are computed separately based on taxable income of the individual subsidiary and reported on separate federal tax returns.
The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has completed its review of the Company's federal income tax returns through the 1996 tax year. Any adjustments that may result from IRS examinations of tax returns 170 are not expected to have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the Company.
The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities at December31 are as follows: (in millions) 2004 2003 Deferred assets Discount on loss reserves $ 444 $ 452 Unearned premium reserves 675 620 Life and annuity reserves 975 734 Other postretirement benefits 264 249 Other assets 478 488 Total deferred assets 2,836 2,543 Deferred liabilities Deferred policy acquisition costs (1,557 ) (1,549 ) Unrealized net capital gains (1,609 ) (1,679 ) Pension (267 ) (237 ) Other liabilities (232 ) (181 ) Total deferred liabilities (3,665 ) (3,646 ) Net deferred liability $ (829 ) $ (1,103 ) Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized based on the assumption that certain levels of income will be achieved. The total amount of the valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets was $2million and $8million at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The components of income tax expense for the years ended December31 are as follows: (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Current $ 1,280 $ 538 $ (8 ) Deferred (50 ) 308 73 Total income tax expense $ 1,230 $ 846 $ 65 The Company paid income taxes of $1.21billion and $279million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and received net income tax refunds of $14million in 2002. The Company had a current income tax payable of $145million and $125million at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate on income from operations for the years ended December31 is as follows: 2004 2003 2002 Statutory federal income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % Tax-exempt income (7.4 ) (9.1 ) (20.0 ) Adjustment to prior year tax liabilities (0.2 ) (1.6 ) (8.5 ) Other (0.6 ) (0.6 ) (2.2 ) Effective income tax rate 26.8 % 23.7 % 4.3 % 171 Prior to January1, 1984, ALIC and certain other life insurance subsidiaries included in the Allstate Financial segment were entitled to exclude certain amounts from taxable income and accumulate such amounts in a "policyholder surplus" account. Pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("the 2004 Act"), ALIC and the affected subsidiaries can reduce the policyholders surplus account in 2005 and 2006 without incurring any tax liability. The aggregate balance in this account at December31, 2004 was $103million, which prior to the 2004 Act would have resulted in federal income taxes payable of $36million if such amounts had been distributed or deemed distributed from the policyholders surplus account. No provision for taxes has ever been made for this item since the affected subsidiaries had no intention of distributing such amounts. ALIC and the affected subsidiaries expect to utilize this provision, thereby eliminating or substantially reducing this potential tax liability.
15.Statutory Financial Information Allstate's domestic property-liability and life insurance subsidiaries prepare their statutory-basis financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the applicable state of domicile. Prescribed statutory accounting practices include a variety of publications of the NAIC, as well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules. Permitted statutory accounting practices encompass all accounting practices not so prescribed.
All states require domiciled insurance companies to prepare statutory-basis financial statements in conformity with the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual ("Codification"), subject to any deviations prescribed or permitted by the applicable insurance commissioner and/or director.
Statutory accounting practices primarily differ from GAAP since they require charging policy acquisition and certain sales inducement costs to expense as incurred, establishing life insurance reserves based on different actuarial assumptions, and valuing investments and establishing deferred taxes on a different basis.
Statutory net income and capital and surplus of Allstate's domestic insurance subsidiaries, determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities are as follows: Net income Capital and Surplus (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 Amounts by major business type: Property-Liability $ 3,334 $ 2,976 $ 1,626 $ 13,111 $ 12,541 Allstate Financial 294 605 92 3,804 3,746 Amount per statutory accounting practices $ 3,628 $ 3,581 $ 1,718 $ 16,915 $ 16,287 The Property-Liability statutory capital and surplus balances above exclude wholly-owned subsidiaries included in the Allstate Financial segment.
Dividends The ability of the Company to pay dividends is dependent on business conditions, income, cash requirements of the Company, receipt of dividends from AIC and other relevant factors. The payment of shareholder dividends by AIC without the prior approval of the state insurance regulator is limited to formula amounts based on net income and capital and surplus, determined in conformity with statutory accounting practices, as well as the timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding twelve months. Notification and approval of inter-company lending activities is also required by the Illinois Department of 172 Insurance ("IL DOI") for transactions that exceed a level that is based on a formula using statutory admitted assets and statutory surplus.
In the twelve-month period beginning January1, 2004, AIC paid dividends of $2.49billion, which was less than the maximum amount allowed under Illinois insurance law, without the prior approval of the IL DOI based on 2003 formula amounts. Based on 2004 AIC statutory net income, the maximum amount of dividends AIC will be able to pay without prior IL DOI approval at a given point in time during 2005 is $3.86billion, less dividends paid during the preceding twelve months measured at that point in time.
16.Benefit Plans Pension and other postretirement plans Defined benefit pension plans cover most full-time employees, certain part-time employees and employee-agents. Benefits under the pension plans are based upon the employee's length of service and eligible annual compensation. A cash balance formula was added to the Allstate Retirement Plan effective January1, 2003. All eligible employees hired before August1, 2002 were provided with a one-time opportunity to choose between the cash balance formula and the final average pay formula. The cash balance formula applies to all eligible employees hired after August1, 2002.
The Company also provides certain health care and life insurance subsidies for employees hired before January1, 2003 when they retire ("Postretirement benefits"). Qualified employees may become eligible for these benefits if they retire in accordance with the Company's established retirement policy and are continuously insured under the Company's group plans or other approved plans in accordance with the plan's participation requirements. The Company shares the cost of the retiree medical benefits with retirees based on years of service, with the Company's share being subject to a 5% limit on annual medical cost inflation after retirement. The Company has the right to modify or terminate these plans.
Obligations and funded status The Company calculates benefit obligations based upon generally accepted actuarial methodologies using the projected benefit obligation ("PBO") for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement plans. The determination of pension costs and other postretirement obligations as of December31 are determined using an October31 measurement date. The benefit obligations are the actuarial present value of all benefits attributed to employee service rendered. The PBO is measured using the pension benefit formula and assumptions as to future compensation levels. A plan's funded status is calculated as the difference between the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. The Company's funding policy for the pension plans is to make annual contributions in accordance with regulations under the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") and in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles. The Company's postretirement benefit plans are not funded.
173 A reconciliation of the plans' funded status to amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December31 is as follows: Pension benefits Postretirement benefits (in millions) 2004 2003 2004 2003 Fair value of plan assets $ 3,983 $ 3,437 $  $  Benefit obligation 4,981 4,317 1,244 1,163 Funded status (998 ) (880 ) (1,244 ) (1,163 ) Amounts not recognized: Unamortized prior service cost (27 ) (32 ) (14 ) (16 ) Unrecognized net actuarial loss 2,333 2,044 290 277 Net amount recognized $ 1,308 $ 1,132 $ (968 ) $ (902 ) Prepaid benefit costs $ 980 $ 814 $  $  Accrued benefit cost (279 ) (243 ) (968 ) (902 ) Intangible assets 8 9   Accumulated other comprehensive income 599 552   Net amount recognized $ 1,308 $ 1,132 $ (968 ) $ (902 ) The majority of the $2.33billion and $2.04billion of unrecognized net actuarial pension benefit losses in 2004 and 2003, respectively, reflect the effect of increases in the PBO resulting from decreases in the discount rate as well as the impact of unfavorable equity market conditions on the value of the pension plan assets in prior years. Allstate amortizes its excess unrecognized net actuarial losses over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits.
The accumulated benefit obligation ("ABO") for all defined benefit pension plans was $4.14billion and $3.62billion at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The ABO is the actuarial present value of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered. However, it differs from the PBO due to the exclusion of an assumption as to future compensation levels. A minimum pension liability is recognized as a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income when the ABO exceeds the fair value of plan assets. In 2004, the minimum pension liability increased by $30million, after-tax, and was reported as a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income. In 2003, the Company recorded a decrease in the minimum pension liability of $461million, after-tax, which was reported as an increase to accumulated other comprehensive income.
The PBO, ABO, and fair value of plan assets for the Company pension plans with an ABO in excess of plan assets were $1.09billion, $1.04billion, and $758million, respectively as of December31, 2004, and $945million, $934million, and $692million, respectively, as of December31, 2003.
Included in the accrued benefit cost of the pension benefits are certain unfunded non-qualified plans with accrued benefit costs of $116million and $83million for 2004 and 2003, respectively.
174 The changes in benefit obligations for all plans for the years ended December31 are as follows: Pension benefits Postretirement benefits (in millions) 2004 2003 2004 2003 Change in benefit obligation Benefit obligation, beginning of year $ 4,317 $ 3,684 $ 1,163 $ 1,032 Service cost 157 134 28 18 Interest cost 268 254 71 71 Participant contributions 1 1 39 32 Actuarial loss 496 472 27 91 Benefits paid (266 ) (250 ) (86 ) (84 ) Translation adjustment and other 8 22 2 3 Benefit obligation, end of year $ 4,981 $ 4,317 $ 1,244 $ 1,163 Benefits paid include lump sum distributions, a portion of which may trigger settlement accounting treatment.
Components of net periodic cost The components of net periodic cost for all plans for the years ended December31 are as follows: Pension benefits Postretirement benefits (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 Service cost $ 157 $ 134 $ 123 $ 28 $ 18 $ 16 Interest cost 268 254 233 71 71 67 Expected return on plan assets (288 ) (221 ) (306 )    Amortization of: Prior service costs (3 ) (3 ) 5 (1 ) (1 ) (1 ) Unrecognized transition obligation  (1 ) 1    Net loss 121 92 11 14 8 5 Settlement loss 41 43 59    Net periodic cost $ 296 $ 298 $ 126 $ 112 $ 96 $ 87 Assumptions Weighted average assumptions used to determine net pension cost and net postretirement benefit cost for the years ended December31 are: Pension benefits Postretirement benefits 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 Weighted average discount rate 6.25 % 7.0 % 7.25 % 6.25 % 7.0 % 7.25 % Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.0-4.5 4.0-5.0 4.0-5.0 n/a n/a n/a Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 8.5 8.5 9.5 n/a n/a n/a 175 Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December31, based on an October31 measurement date, are: Pension benefits Postretirement benefits 2004 2003 2004 2003 Discount rate 5.75 % 6.25 % 5.75 % 6.25 % Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.0-4.5 4.0-5.0 n/a n/a The weighted average health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit cost is 10.50% for 2005, gradually declining to 5.50% in 2010 and remaining at that level thereafter.
Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement health care plans. A one percentage-point increase in assumed health care cost trend rates would increase the total of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost of other postretirement benefits and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $6million and $62million, respectively. A one percentage-point decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would decrease the total of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost of other postretirement benefits and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $8million and $54million, respectively.
Plan Assets The pension plans target percentage of plan assets at 2004 and the actual percentage of plan assets, by asset category at December31 are as follows: Targetpercentageof plan assets Percentageof plan assets Asset Category 2004 2004 2003 Equity securities 66 % 62 % 63 % Fixed income securities 29 31 32 Real estate 1 1  Other 4 6 5 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets. This assumption is reviewed annually giving consideration to appropriate financial data including, but not limited to, the plan asset allocation, the period over which benefits will be paid, historical returns on plan assets and other relevant market data. As of the 2004 measurement date, the arithmetic average of the annual actual return on plan assets for the most recent 10 and 5years was 10.8% and 1.7%, respectively. This is consistent with the allocation used to determine the long-term return on plan assets assumption at December31, 2004 and 2003 of 8.5%.
176 The change in pension plan assets for the years ended December31 is as follows: Pension benefits (in millions) 2004 2003 Fair value of plan assets, beginning of year $ 3,437 $ 2,322 Actual return on plan assets 340 475 Employer contribution 468 871 Benefits paid (266 ) (250 ) Translation adjustment and other 4 19 Fair value of plan assets, end of year $ 3,983 $ 3,437 Cash Flows There was no minimum funding requirement under the IRC for the tax qualified pension plans as of December31, 2004. The company currently plans to contribute $71million to its pension plans in 2005. This plan is subject to revision at the discretion of management.
The Company contributed to the postretirement benefit plans $47million and $51million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company estimates that it will contribute $59million for its postretirement benefit plans in 2005. Contributions by participants to the postretirement benefit plans were $39million and $32million for the years ending December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Estimated Future Benefit Payments Estimated future benefit payments expected to be paid in the next ten years based on the assumptions used to measure the Company's benefit obligation at December31, 2004 are as follows: (in millions) Pension benefits Postretirement benefits 2005 $ 188 $ 59 2006 204 62 2007 230 66 2008 268 68 2009 323 72 2010-2014 2,182 407 Total benefit payments $ 3,395 $ 734 Profit sharing plans Employees of the Company, with the exception of those employed by the Company's Canadian subsidiaries and Sterling, are eligible to become members of The Savings and Profit Sharing Fund of Allstate Employees ("Allstate Plan"). The Company's contributions are based on the Company's matching obligation and performance. The Allstate Plan includes an ESOP to pre-fund a portion of the Company's anticipated contribution. In connection with the Allstate Plan, the Company has a note from the ESOP with a current principal balance of $70million. The ESOP note has a fixed interest rate of 7.9% and matures in 2019.
177 The Company's contribution to the Allstate Plan was $112million, $125million and $120million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These amounts were reduced by the ESOP benefit computed for the years ended December31 as follows: (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Interest expense recognized by ESOP $ 6 $ 8 $ 10 Less dividends accrued on ESOP shares (14 ) (14 ) (26 ) Cost of shares allocated 17 24 27 9 18 11 Reduction of defined contribution due to ESOP 107 128 120 ESOP benefit $ (98 ) $ (110 ) $ (109 ) The Company contributed $24million, $34million and $10million to the ESOP in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. At December31, 2004, total committed to be released, allocated and unallocated ESOP shares were 2million, 26million, and 11million, respectively.
Allstate has profit sharing plans for eligible employees of its Canadian insurance subsidiaries and Sterling. Profit sharing expense for these plans is not significant.
17.Equity Incentive Plans The Company has three equity incentive plans which permit the Company to grant nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted or unrestricted shares of the Company's stock and restricted stock units to certain employees and directors of the Company. A maximum of 78.1million shares of common stock will be subject to awards under the plans, subject to adjustment in accordance with the plans' terms. At December31, 2004 and 2003, 22.7million and 26.9million shares, respectively, were reserved and remained available for future issuance under these plans. To date, the Company has not issued incentive stock options. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company issued 0.6million, 1.1million and .1million shares of restricted stock, respectively, to employees under the plans. The weighted average grant date fair value of these restricted shares was $45.98, $32.00 and $37.20 as of December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Generally, the restricted shares unrestrict in full on the fourth anniversary of the grant date, with awards subject to forfeiture upon termination (other than termination due to retirement, upon which shares continue to unrestrict as provided for in the original grant).
The Company records compensation expense for the restricted shares over the vesting period and the unamortized cost of the restricted shares is included in deferred compensation expense as a component of shareholders' equity. In 2003, the Company began prospectively expensing the fair value of all stock options granted on or after January1, 2003 in accordance with SFAS148 (see Note2). Options are granted under the plans at exercise prices equal to the fair value of the Company's common stock on the applicable grant date. The options granted under the Allstate plans generally vest ratably over a three or four-year period. The options granted may be exercised once vested and will expire ten years after the date of grant.
178 The changes in stock options for the years ended December31 are as follows: (number of shares in thousands) 2004 Weighted average exercise price 2003 Weighted average exercise price 2002 Weighted average exercise price Beginning balance 32,597 $ 34.12 31,957 $ 33.57 25,544 $ 32.96 Granted 4,272 45.93 4,724 32.28 8,508 33.52 Exercised (7,560 ) 31.32 (3,198 ) 25.34 (1,263 ) 20.42 Canceled or expired (608 ) 35.67 (886 ) 35.90 (832 ) 34.53 Ending balance 28,701 36.59 32,597 34.12 31,957 33.57 Exercisable 16,440 35.30 18,448 34.11 16,026 32.40 Weighted average fair value (at grant date) for options granted during the year $ 12.10 $ 8.08 $ 8.81 The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for grants in 2004, 2003 and 2002; dividend yield of 2.4%, 2.7% and 2.5%, respectively; volatility factor of 30%; risk-free interest rate of 3.28%, 3.15% and 4.94%, respectively; and expected life of six years.

These segments and their respective operations are as follows: Allstate Protection sells principally private passenger auto and homeowners insurance in the United States and Canada. Revenues generated outside the United States were $622million, $596million and $509million for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company evaluates the results of this segment based upon underwriting results.
Discontinued Lines and Coverages consists of business no longer written by Allstate, including results from environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures, and certain commercial and other business in run-off. This segment also includes the historical results of the commercial and reinsurance businesses sold in 1996. The Company evaluates the results of this segment based upon underwriting results.
Allstate Financial sells life insurance, retirement and investment products to individual and institutional customers. Individual retail products include traditional life, interest-sensitive life, supplemental accident and health insurance, variable life, long-term care insurance, variable and fixed annuities and funding agreements. Banking products and services are also offered to customers through the Allstate Bank. The principal institutional product is funding agreements backing medium-term notes. Revenues generated outside the United States were immaterial with respect to Allstate Financial total revenues for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. The Company evaluates the results of this segment based upon operating income.
Corporate and Other comprises holding company activities and certain non-insurance operations.
Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages together comprise Property-Liability. The Company does not allocate Property-Liability investment income, realized capital gains and losses, or assets to the Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments. Management reviews assets at the Property-Liability, Allstate Financial, and Corporate and Other levels for decision-making purposes.
180 The accounting policies of the business segments are the same as those described in Note2. The effects of certain inter-segment transactions are excluded from segment performance evaluation and therefore eliminated in the segment results.
Measuring segment profit or loss The measure of segment profit or loss used by Allstate's management in evaluating performance is underwriting income (loss) for the Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments and operating income (loss) for Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other segments. A reconciliation of these measures to income before dividends on preferred securities and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after-tax, is provided below.
Underwriting income (loss) is calculated as premiums earned, less claims and claims expenses ("losses"), amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses, and restructuring and related charges as determined using GAAP.
Operating income (loss) is income (loss) before dividends on preferred securities and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after-tax, excluding:  realized capital gains and losses, after-tax, except for periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments, which are reported with realized capital gains and losses but included in operating income,  amortization of DAC and DSI, to the extent they resulted from the recognition of realized capital gains and losses,  loss (gain) on disposition of operations, after-tax and  adjustments for other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items, when (a)the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years, or (b)there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years.
181 Summarized revenue data for each of the Company's business segments for the years ended December31 are as follows: (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues Property-Liability Property-liability insurance premiums Standard Auto $ 15,498 $ 14,601 $ 13,861 Non-standard auto 1,984 2,238 2,502 Auto 17,482 16,839 16,363 Homeowners 5,878 5,386 4,745 Other 2,623 2,439 2,243 Allstate Protection 25,983 24,664 23,351 Discontinued Lines and Coverages 6 13 10 Total property-liability insurance premiums 25,989 24,677 23,361 Net investment income 1,773 1,677 1,656 Realized capital gains and losses 592 288 (496 ) Total Property-Liability 28,354 26,642 24,521 Allstate Financial Life and annuity premiums and contract charges Traditional Life 321 388 403 Immediate annuities with life contingencies 316 413 416 Accident, health and other 408 564 552 Total life and annuity premiums 1,045 1,365 1,371 Interest-sensitive life 729 688 672 Fixed annuities 52 37 32 Variable annuities 246 206 212 Institutional products  8 6 Total contract charges 1,027 939 922 Total life and annuity premiums and contract charges 2,072 2,304 2,293 Net investment income 3,410 3,233 3,121 Realized capital gains and losses 1 (85 ) (432 ) Total Allstate Financial 5,483 5,452 4,982 Corporate and Other Service fees 12 13 40 Net investment income 101 62 72 Realized capital gains and losses (2 ) (7 ) 4 Total Corporate and Other before reclassification of service fees 111 68 116 Reclassification of service fees (1) (12 ) (13 ) (40 ) Total Corporate and Other 99 55 76 Consolidated Revenues $ 33,936 $ 32,149 $ 29,579 (1) For presentation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, service fees of the Corporate and Other segment are reclassified to operating costs and expenses.

183 Additional significant financial performance data for each of the Company's reportable segments for the years ended December31 are as follows: (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs Property-Liability $ 3,874 $ 3,520 $ 3,216 Allstate Financial 591 538 478 Consolidated $ 4,465 $ 4,058 $ 3,694 Income tax expense Property-Liability $ 1,150 $ 780 $ 112 Allstate Financial 189 170 52 Corporate and Other (109 ) (104 ) (99 ) Consolidated $ 1,230 $ 846 $ 65 In 2004, the Company wrote down $108million of DAC and $16million of DSI due to the adoption of SOP 03-1 (see Note2). In addition, the Company recorded $45million of amortization related to DSI in 2004.
Interest expense is primarily incurred in the Corporate and Other segment. Capital expenditures for long-lived assets are generally made in the Property-Liability segment. A portion of these long-lived assets are used by entities included in the Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other segments, and accordingly, are charged expenses in proportion to their use.
Summarized data for total assets and investments for each of the Company's reportable segments as of December31 are as follows: (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Assets Property-Liability $ 52,458 $ 49,191 $ 43,812 Allstate Financial 94,274 82,890 72,566 Corporate and Other 2,993 2,061 1,048 Consolidated $ 149,725 $ 134,142 $ 117,426 Investments Property-Liability $ 40,267 $ 37,859 $ 34,253 Allstate Financial 72,530 62,895 55,264 Corporate and Other 2,733 2,327 1,133 Consolidated $ 115,530 $ 103,081 $ 90,650 184 19.Other Comprehensive Income The components of other comprehensive income (loss) on a pretax and after-tax basis for the years ended December31 are as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (in millions) Pretax Tax After- tax Pretax Tax After- tax Pretax Tax After- tax Unrealized net holding gains arising during the period $ 416 $ (145 ) $ 271 $ 961 $ (336 ) $ 625 $ 370 $ (129 ) $ 241 Less: reclassification adjustment 627 (219 ) 408 157 (55 ) 102 (881 ) 309 (572 ) Unrealized net capital gains (losses) (211 ) 74 (137 ) 804 (281 ) 523 1,251 (438 ) 813 Unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments 40 (14 ) 26 60 (21 ) 39 (9 ) 3 (6 ) Unrealized minimum pension liability adjustments (46 ) 16 (30 ) 710 (249 ) 461 (1,134 ) 397 (737 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) $ (217 ) $ 76 $ (141 ) $ 1,574 $ (551 ) $ 1,023 $ 108 $ (38 ) $ 70 20.Quarterly Results (unaudited) First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter (in millions except per share data) 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 Revenues $ 8,311 $ 7,861 $ 8,304 $ 7,899 $ 8,442 $ 8,127 $ 8,879 $ 8,262 Income before dividends on preferred securities and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after-tax 1,124 668 1,034 590 56 692 1,142 775 Net income 949 665 1,034 588 56 691 1,142 761 Earnings per share-Basic: Income before dividends on preferred securities and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after-tax 1.60 0.95 1.47 0.84 0.10 0.99 1.65 1.09 Net income 1.35 0.95 1.47 0.84 0.10 0.98 1.65 1.08 Earnings per share-Diluted: Income before dividends on preferred securities and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after-tax 1.59 0.94 1.47 0.84 0.09 0.98 1.64 1.09 Net income 1.34 0.94 1.47 0.84 0.09 0.97 1.64 1.08 185 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF THE ALLSTATE CORPORATION We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position of The Allstate Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related Consolidated Statements of Operations, Comprehensive Income, Shareholders' Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004. We also have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements, an opinion on management's assessment, and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that 186 the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
As discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for certain nontraditional long-duration contracts and separate accounts in 2004, method of accounting for stock-based compensation, embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance agreements, and variable interest entities in 2003 and method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in 2002.

Item9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with or submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act is made known to management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004 based on the criteria related to internal control over financial reporting described in "Internal ControlIntegrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2004.
Our management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004 has been audited by Deloitte& Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that issued an attestation report on management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
During the fiscal quarter ended December31, 2004, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Item9B. Other Information The following disclosures relate to actions taken by the Board of Directors of The Allstate Corporation and the Compensation and Succession Committee of the Board on February22, 2005 and would otherwise have been filed during the first fiscal quarter of 2005 on a Form8-K under the heading "Item1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement:"  Upon recommendation from the Compensation and Succession Committee, the Board approved the following 2005 annual base salaries: EdwardM. Liddy, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, $1,175,004; DannyL. Hale, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, $565,008; RonaldD. McNeil, Senior Vice President, Allstate Protection Product Distribution, $469,800; RobertW. Pike, Vice President and Secretary, $549,000; and ThomasJ. Wilson,II, President, Allstate Protection, $702,000. These salaries are effective as of April1, 2005 and may be changed at any time at the discretion of the Board. These "named executive officers" include the chief executive officer and the other four most highly compensated executive officers based on 2004 annual base salaries and annual bonuses with respect to 2004 expected to be approved by the Committee in March. In 188 addition, the Compensation and Succession Committee granted the following restricted stock unit (RSU) awards under the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan to the company's named executive officers: EdwardM. Liddy, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, 35,083RSUs; DannyL. Hale, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, 9,097RSUs; RonaldD. McNeil, Senior Vice President, Allstate Protection Product Distribution, 6,009RSUs; RobertW. Pike, Vice President and Secretary, 8,847RSUs; and ThomasJ. Wilson,II, President, Allstate Protection, 16,818RSUs.
The registrant maintains two shareholder-approved plans under which executive officers have the opportunity to receive an annual cash award based on the achievement of performance goals over a one-year period. The Annual Covered Employee Incentive Compensation Plan (Covered Employee Plan) governs awards to those executive officers who are considered "covered employees" as defined in Section162(m)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Annual incentive awards to all other executive officers are governed by and made under the Annual Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (Executive Plan). The Compensation and Succession Committee establishes performance goals for each fiscal year and sets threshold, target and maximum award opportunities. The Committee has the authority to adjust the amount of awards, but has no authority to increase the amount of an award otherwise payable under the Covered Employee Plan. Payments are made after the Committee has certified in writing the degree of attainment of the performance goals.
The Committee approved performance goals and target awards for 2005. The same performance goals and target awards apply to both the Covered Employee Plan and Executive Plan. For the chief executive officer and executive officers in corporate functions, there are two equally-weighted goals. One is based on an adjusted operating income per diluted share measure as approved by the Committee. The other goal is based on combined business unit results.
For Allstate Protection executive officers, their award opportunity is based on five performance goals, weighted as follows: 50% based on a matrix that measures the results of premium growth, policy growth and combined ratio; 15% based on a matrix measuring sales of Allstate Financial products by Allstate exclusive agencies; 10% based on expense ratio reduction; 15% based on a measure of customer loyalty; and 10% based on the corporate adjusted operating income per diluted share measure.
For the Allstate Financial executive officer, there are six performance goals, weighted as follows: 30% based on adjusted Allstate Financial operating income; 20% based on expense management; 15% based on new traditional life premiums; 15% based on annuity sales; 10% based on profitability of new sales; and 10% based on the corporate adjusted operating income per diluted share measure.
For the executive officer in the Investments business unit, there are four performance goals, weighted as follows: 45% based on property/casualty portfolio total return; 35% on Allstate Financial spread volume goal; 10% on Allstate Financial portfolio loss reduction; and 10% based on the corporate adjusted operating income per diluted share measure.
Threshold, target and maximum levels of performance are established for each performance goal. If the maximum level of performance is achieved, the award would be three times the executive officer's target award, with target awards ranging from 70% to 120% of annual salary for the fiscal year.

S-4 THE ALLSTATE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES SCHEDULE II (CONTINUED)CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF REGISTRANT NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 1.General The financial statements of the Registrant should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Item 8. To conform to the 2004 presentation, certain amounts in the prior years' condensed financial statements of the registrant have been reclassified. The short-term debt and long-term debt presented in Note11 "Capital Structure" are direct obligations of the Company, with the exception of the following obligations at December31: (in millions) 2004 2003 Short-term: Federal Funds purchased $  $ 3 Long-term: Floating Rate Notes, due 2012 to 2017, callable 57 77 Investment management VIE obligations, floating rates, due 2012 to 2013 279 691 Other Various Notes, due 2008 1 1 Synthetic lease VIE obligations, floating rates, due 2006 117 112 Structured investment security VIE obligations, due 2007 47 45 2.Receivable and Payable to Subsidiaries The majority of the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper has been loaned to subsidiaries through an intercompany loan agreement and is used for general purposes.
In August of 2004, the registrant fully repaid a promissory note (the "note") with a principal balance of $405million to its subsidiary Allstate Insurance Company ("AIC"). The note, which was payable on December1, 2007 or earlier upon demand, was issued to AIC in December of 2002 to replace a previous note for the same amount due April2003. The note had a stated annual interest rate of 4.25%. The Registrant recorded $11million, $17million and $24million of interest expense in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to these borrowings.
In 1996, the registrant issued 200,000 junior subordinated debentures ("debentures") with a par value of $1,000 per debenture and an interest rate of 7.83% and a contractual maturity of December1, 2045 to Allstate Financing II ("AF II"), a variable interest entity ("VIE"), which in prior periods met the consolidation requirements of existing accounting guidance for reporting in the Consolidated Financial Statements of The Allstate Corporation. As a result, in prior periods, the debentures were reported as a component of payable to subsidiaries on the Statements of Financial Position of the registrant. During 2003, the Company's adoption of FASB Interpretation No.46 resulted in the deconsolidation of AF II, resulting in the registrant reclassifying the debentures from payable to subsidiaries to long-term debt.
