However, the Company does not consider any single patent or trademark, or any group thereof, essential either to its business as a whole or to either of its business segments. The annual royalties received or paid under license agreements are not significant to either of its reportable segments or to the Companys overall operations.
Employees At December31, 2011, the Company employed approximately 12,200 people in its EMG, EIG and corporate operations, of whom approximately 2,100 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company has two collective bargaining agreements that will expire in 2012, which cover less than 100 employees. The Company expects no material adverse effects from the pending labor contract negotiations.
Working Capital Practices The Company does not have extraordinary working capital requirements in either of its reportable segments. Customers generally are billed at normal trade terms, which may include extended payment provisions. Inventories are closely controlled and maintained at levels related to production cycles and are responsive to the normal delivery requirements of customers.
Item1A.
Risk Factors You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
11 Table of Contents A prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process instrumentation or electric motor markets could adversely affect our business.
Several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control. A prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process instrumentation or electric motor markets could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions.
A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses. Since the beginning of 2007, through December31, 2011, we have completed 27 acquisitions. We plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Although we have been successful with our acquisition strategies in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors, including:  Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;  The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase acquisition costs and affect our ability to consummate acquisitions on favorable terms and may result in us assuming a greater portion of the sellers liabilities;  Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including integrating the financial, technological and management processes, procedures and controls of the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations;  Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms acceptable to us;  U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations affecting our ability to make certain acquisitions;  Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of acquired businesses;  Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and  Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.
The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Furthermore, even if successfully integrated, the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned. Failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We may experience unanticipated start-up expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or product line transfers.
Certain of our businesses are relocating or have recently relocated manufacturing operations to low-cost locales. Unanticipated start-up expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or completing product line transfers, as well as possible underutilization of our existing facilities, could result in production inefficiencies, which would adversely affect our business and operations.
12 Table of Contents Our substantial international sales and operations are subject to customary risks associated with international operations.
International sales for 2011 and 2010 represented 50.2% and 49.0% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. As a result of our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the United States will increase in the future. International operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment, including:  Potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions;  Overlap of different tax structures;  Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;  Changes in tariffs and trade barriers;  Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate, subjecting us to exchange rate exposures;  Restrictions on currency repatriation;  General economic conditions;  Unstable political situations;  Nationalization of assets; and  Compliance with a wide variety of international and U.S. laws and regulatory requirements.
Our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws.
We are required to comply with various import, export, export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation.
Any inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully.
If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses, manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations.
If we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects.
We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards. Although we believe we have certain 13 Table of Contents technological and other advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. We are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete, although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products.
A shortage of or price increases in our raw materials could increase our operating costs.
We have multiple sources of supply for our major raw material requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier; however, certain items, including base metals and certain steel components, are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations. Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance clean-up which may adversely affect our financial condition.
Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, air emissions, discharges to waters and the use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous materials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act generally imposes joint and several liability for clean-up costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for clean-up under the Act. We have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites, which are the subject of government-mandated clean-ups. As the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use, manufacture, store, handle and dispose of various hazardous materials, we may incur substantial costs for investigation, removal, remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws. While it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations, new classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities.
We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs.
Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws and regulations. In addition, existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations, including with respect to climate change, may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products. We cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations.
We may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with alleged or actual harm caused by our products.
We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property. For example, our operations expose us to 14 Table of Contents potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of, for instance, an aircraft component that has been designed, manufactured or serviced by us. We may incur a significant liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful. While we believe our current general liability and product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from future claims, we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate to cover all claims that may arise. Additionally, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability not covered by insurance or for which third-party indemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business.
Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and internationally, with individual producers, as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have resources greater than we do. The principal elements of competition for our products are price, product technology, distribution, quality and service. EMGs competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes. In the markets served by EIG, although we believe EIG is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify. In the pressure gauge, aerospace and heavy-vehicle markets served by EIG, a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality, performance and innovation. Our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers. There can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors.
Restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness.
Our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. These restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions or restrict our financial flexibility.
We are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties.
We engage in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies, letters of credit, credit facilities, financial derivatives and investment management agreements involving various counterparties. We are subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and, therefore, be unable to discharge its obligations under such contracts.
Our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial amount of our total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
Our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December31, 2011, goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $2,789.2 million or 65% of our total assets. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. At a minimum, we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, we could record, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Legal Proceedings Please refer to Environmental Matters in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding certain litigation matters.
In addition to those litigation matters described above, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to its business. These lawsuits may involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Companys products and services, personal injury, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes and intellectual property matters. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions. Based upon the Companys experience, the Company does not believe that these proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with Item1A. Risk Factors, Item6. Selected Financial Data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Business Overview As a global business, AMETEKs operations are affected by global, regional and industry economic factors. However, the Companys strategic geographic and industry diversification, and its mix of products and services, have helped to limit the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable developments in any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. In 2011, the Company established records for net sales, operating income, operating income margins, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. The impact of contributions from recent acquisitions, combined with successful Operational Excellence initiatives, had a positive impact on 2011 results. The Company also benefited from its strategic initiatives under AMETEKs four growth strategies: Operational Excellence, New Product Development, Global and Market Expansion and Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances. Highlights of 2011 were:  In 2011, net sales were $3.0billion, an increase of $518.9million or 21.0% from 2010, on internal growth of approximately 16% in the Electronic Instruments Group (EIG) and 6% in the Electromechanical Group (EMG) excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, and contributions from the 2010 and 2011 acquisitions.
Net income for 2011 was $384.5 million, an increase of $100.6 million or 35.4% when compared with $283.9million in 2010.
During 2011, the Company completed the following acquisitions:  In April 2011, the Company acquired Avicenna Technology, Inc. (Avicenna), a supplier of custom, fine-featured components used in the medical device industry.
In May 2011, the Company acquired Coining Holding Company (Coining), a leading supplier of custom-shaped metal preforms, microstampings and bonding wire solutions for interconnect applications in microelectronics packaging and assembly.

Primary disclosure of the Companys significant accounting policies is in Note1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Revenue Recognition.
The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, under which title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. The policy with respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances, except at the Companys option. The Company has agreements with distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return for unsold products. The distributor purchases the product from the Company, at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the distributor. The Company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume discounts. The Company accounts for the sales incentive as a reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized. Accruals for sales returns, other allowances and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time revenue is recognized based upon past experience. At December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the accrual for future warranty obligations was $22.5 million, $18.3million and $16.0million, respectively. The Companys expense for warranty obligations was $13.2 million, $10.6million and $8.2million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the Companys operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses. If actual future sales returns and allowances and warranty amounts are higher than past experience, additional accruals may be required.
Accounts Receivable.
The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of specific customers to meet their financial obligations to the Company. A specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against the amount due from these customers. For all other customers, the Company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the length of time specific receivables are past due based on its historical experience. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The allowance for possible losses on receivables was $7.8million and $6.0million at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Inventories.
The Company uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of accounting, which approximates current replacement cost, for approximately 74% of its inventories at December31, 2011. The last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting is used to determine cost for the remaining 26% of its inventory at December31, 2011. For inventories where cost is determined by the LIFO method, the FIFO value would have been $25.1million and $23.9million higher than the LIFO value reported in the consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company provides estimated inventory reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future demand, market conditions, customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and related management initiatives. If these factors are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory reserves may be required.
30 Table of Contents  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. The impairment test for goodwill requires a two-step process. The first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, then the second step must be completed, which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability, with the excess being implied goodwill. An impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. The Company would be required to record any such impairment losses.
The Company identifies its reporting units at the component level, which is one level below our operating segments. Generally, goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides. Our reporting units are composed of the business units one level below our operating segment at which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.
The Company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate. The Company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction. The annual goodwill impairment test requires the Company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization and working capital requirements, which are based upon the Companys long-range plan. The Companys long-range plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk premium. While the Company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. While there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions, the Companys overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value calculations, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease in fair values of each reporting unit. The results (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) showed that, despite the hypothetical 10% decrease in fair value, the fair values of the Companys reporting units still exceeded their respective carrying values by 66% to 443% for each of the Companys reporting units.
The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method. The Company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets. The fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
The Companys acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the Company expects to continue to make acquisitions. At December31, 2011, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $2,114.0 million or 48.9% of the Companys total assets. The Company performed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2011 and determined that the Companys goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles were not impaired. There can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future.
Other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of other intangible assets 31 Table of Contents with finite lives is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those assets are less than the carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of those assets. Fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.
Pensions.
The Company has U.S.and foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. The most significant elements in determining the Companys pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. The pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be settled at the valuation date. At the end of each year, the Company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities. In estimating this rate for 2011, the Company considered rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income investments that have maturities consistent with the anticipated funding requirements of the plan. The discount rate used in determining the 2011 pension cost was 5.6% for U.S.defined benefit pension plans and 5.71% for foreign plans. The discount rate used for determining the funded status of the plans at December31, 2011 and determining the 2012 defined benefit pension cost was 5.0% for U.S.plans and 5.22% for foreign plans. In estimating the U.S. and foreigndiscount rates, the Companys actuaries developed a customized discount rate appropriate to the plans projected benefit cash flow based on yields derived from a database of long-term bonds at consistent maturity dates. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2011 of 8.0% for U.S.defined benefit pension plans and 6.96% for foreign plans. The Company will use 8.0% for the U.S. plans in 2012 and 6.96% for the foreign plans in 2012. The Company determines the expected long-term rate of return based primarily on its expectation of future returns for the pension plans investments. Additionally, the Company considers historical returns on comparable fixed-income investments and equity investments and adjusts its estimate as deemed appropriate. The rate of compensation increase used in determining the 2011 pension expense for the U.S.plans was 3.75% and was 2.98% for the foreign plans. The U.S. rate of compensation increase will remain unchanged in 2012. The foreign plans rates of compensation increase will decrease slightly to 2.97% in 2012. In 2011, the Company recognized consolidated pre-tax pension income of $7.4million from its U.S.and foreign defined benefit pension plans, compared with pre-tax pension income of $3.2million recognized for these plans in 2010. The Company estimates its 2012 U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension pre-tax expense to be approximately $0.7 million.
All unrecognized prior service costs, remaining transition obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized, net of tax effects, as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost. The Company uses a December31 measurement date (the date at which plan assets and benefit obligations are measured) for its U.S. and foreigndefined benefit plans.
To fund the plans, the Company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2011 which totaled $5.4million, compared with $3.6million in 2010. The Company anticipates making approximately $3million to $6million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2012.
Income Taxes.
The process of providing for income taxes and determining the related balance sheet accounts requires management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. The Company conducts a broad range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the Companys tax assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to the Companys tax assets and liabilities may be necessary.
The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets, taking into consideration the Companys forecast of future taxable income, available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning 32 Table of Contents strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and the amount of, valuation allowances against the Companys deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.
The Company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions, by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. Once the minimum threshold is met, using a more likely than not standard, a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit. The tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50% likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination. The underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes, published guidance, external expert opinion, or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past. There can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy, legislation and audit practice. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASU2010-06). ASU2010-06 provides amendments that clarify existing disclosures and require new disclosures related to fair value measurements, providing greater disaggregated information on each class of assets and liabilities and more robust disclosures on transfers between levels 1 and 2, and activity in level 3 fair value measurements. The Company adopted the applicable provisions within ASU2010-06 effective January1, 2010. The Company adopted the level 3 disclosure requirements of ASU2010-06 that are effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years as of January1, 2011. The adoption of ASU2010-06 did not have a significant impact on the Companys fair value disclosures.
In April 2010, the FASB issued ASUNo. 2010-17, Revenue Recognition  Milestone Method (ASU2010-17). ASU2010-17 establishes criteria for a milestone to be considered substantive and allows revenue recognition when the milestone is achieved in research or development arrangements. In addition, it requires disclosure of certain information with respect to arrangements that contain milestones. ASU2010-17 was effective on January1, 2011 for the Company and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In December 2010, the FASB issued ASUNo. 2010-29, Business Combinations (ASU2010-29). ASU2010-29 addresses diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma disclosure requirement for business combinations. ASU2010-29 requires disclosure of pro forma revenue and earnings for the current reporting period as though the acquisition date for all business combinations that occurred during the year had been as of the beginning of the annual reporting period for both the current and any comparable periods reported. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements of ASU2010-29 effective January1, 2011. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.
In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No.2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (ASU2011-04). ASU2011-04 amendments result in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between U.S.GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). ASU 2011-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2011. The Company has evaluated ASU2011-04 and does not expect its adoption will have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
33 Table of Contents In June 2011, the FASB issued ASUNo. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU2011-05). ASU2011-05 requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income and the total of comprehensive income. These amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU2011-05 that is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2011 and does not expect its adoption to impact the Companys consolidated financial statements other than the change in presentation.
In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No.2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment (ASU2011-08). The amendments in ASU2011-08 permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic350, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other . ASU2011-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of adopting ASU 2011-08 and intends to adopt ASU 2011-08 for the year ending December31, 2012.
Internal Reinvestment Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $50.8million or 1.7% of net sales in 2011, compared with $39.2million or 1.6% of net sales in 2010. 55% of the expenditures in 2011 were for improvements to existing equipment or additional equipment to increase productivity and expand capacity. The Companys 2011 capital expenditures increased due to a continuing emphasis on spending to improve productivity and expand manufacturing capabilities. The 2012 capital expenditures are expected to approximate 1.8% of net sales, with a continued emphasis on spending to improve productivity.
Development and Engineering The Company is committed to research, development and engineering activities that are designed to identify and develop potential new and improved products or enhance existing products. Research, development and engineering costs before customer reimbursement were $137.6 million, $112.1 million and $101.4million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Customer reimbursements in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $6.1million, $6.4 million and $5.5 million, respectively. These amounts included net Company-funded research and development expenses of $78.0 million, $56.8million and $50.5million, respectively. All such expenditures were directed toward the development of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and processes.
Environmental Matters Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations. The Company believes these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time. At December31, 2011, the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at 15 non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the non-owned sites). The Company is identified as a de minimis party in14 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In ten of these sites, the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount. At the remaining site where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company 34 Table of Contents is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the Companys expected obligations. The Company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations (the owned sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements. In estimating the Companys liability for remediation, the Company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.
Total environmental reserves at December31, 2011 and 2010 were $28.0million and $31.3million, respectively, for both non-owned and owned sites. In 2011, the Company recorded $1.2 million in reserves. Additionally, the Company spent $4.5million on environmental matters in 2011. The Companys reserves for environmental liabilities at December31, 2011 and 2010 include reserves of $17.5million and $18.9million, respectively, for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of HCC Industries (HCC). The Company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a large Superfund site in the SanGabriel Valley of California. The Company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required remedial activities. At December31, 2011, the Company had $14.3million in receivables related to HCC for probable recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed third-party funds to support the required remediation. Also, the Company is indemnified by HCCs former owners for approximately $19.0million of additional costs.
The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in all material respects.
The Company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. The Company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.
Market Risk The Companys primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which could impact its financial condition and results of operations. The Company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. The Companys differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating income as a whole.
The Companys short-term debt carries variable interest rates and generally its long-term debt carries fixed rates. These financial instruments are more fully described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
35 Table of Contents The foreign currencies to which the Company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the Chinese renminbi, the Euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Mexican peso. Exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored, and when possible, mitigated through the occasional use of local borrowings and derivative financial instruments in the foreign country affected. The effect of translating foreign subsidiaries balance sheets into U.S.dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity. Foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the Company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies.
The primary commodities to which the Company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel, aluminum, copper, steel, titanium and gold. Exposure to price changes in these commodities is generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements, although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures.
Based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates, commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates, the Companys best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings, fair value of risk-sensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material, although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis.
Forward-Looking Information Certain matters discussed in this Form10-K are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the Companys operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in determining the Companys actual future results. The Company wishes to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA by cautioning readers that numerous important factors, in some cases have caused, and in the future could cause, the Companys actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. Some, but not all, of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under Item1A. Risk Factors. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise, unless required by the securities laws to do so.

37 Table of Contents Managements Responsibility for Financial Statements Management has prepared and is responsible for the integrity of the consolidated financial statements and related information. The statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied and include certain amounts based on managements best estimates and judgments. Historical financial information elsewhere in this report is consistent with that in the financial statements.
In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the financial information, management maintains a system of internal accounting and disclosure controls, including an internal audit program. The system of controls provides for appropriate division of responsibility and the application of written policies and procedures. That system, which undergoes continual reevaluation, is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and records are adequate for the preparation of reliable financial data.
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We maintain a system of internal controls that is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the fair and reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements; however, there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal controls.
Management recognizes its responsibility for conducting the Companys activities according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. That responsibility is characterized and reflected in a code of business conduct for all employees and in a financial code of ethics for the Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers, as well as in other key policy statements publicized throughout the Company.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent directors who are not employees of the Company, meets with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and management to satisfy itself that each is properly discharging its responsibilities. The report of the Audit Committee is included in the Companys Proxy Statement for the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Both the independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have direct access to the Audit Committee.
The Companys independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst& Young LLP, is engaged to render an opinion as to whether managements financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the Companys financial position and operating results. This report is included herein.
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011 based on the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2011.
The Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011 has been audited by Ernst&Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.
AMETEK, Inc.
February23, 2012 38 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of AMETEK, Inc.: We have audited AMETEK, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). AMETEK, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, AMETEK, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria .
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of AMETEK, Inc. as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011, and our report dated February23, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
/s/ ERNST& YOUNG LLP Philadelphia, Pennsylvania February23, 2012 39 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of AMETEK, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AMETEK, Inc. as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of AMETEK, Inc. (the Company), and include the accounts of the Company and subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany transactions in the consolidation. The Companys investments in 50% or less owned joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. Such investments are not significant to the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash Equivalents, Securities and Other Investments All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents. At December31, 2011 and 2010, all of the Companys equity securities and fixed-income securities (primarily those of a captive insurance subsidiary) are classified as available-for-sale, although the Company may hold fixed-income securities until their maturity dates. Fixed-income securities generally mature within three years. The aggregate market value of equity and fixed-income securities at December31, 2011 and 2010 was $7.3million ($7.3million amortized cost) and $4.7million ($4.5million amortized cost), respectively. The temporary unrealized gain or loss on such securities is recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (in stockholders equity), and is not significant. Certain of the Companys other investments, which are not significant, are also accounted for by the equity method of accounting as discussed above.
Accounts Receivable The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of specific customers to meet their financial obligations to the Company. A specific reserve for doubtful receivables is recorded against the amount due from these customers. For all other customers, the Company recognizes reserves for doubtful receivables based on the length of time specific receivables are past due based on past experience. The allowance for possible losses on receivables was $7.8million and $6.0million at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. See Note 7.
Inventories The Company uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of accounting, which approximates current replacement cost, for 74% of its inventories at December31, 2011. The last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting is used to determine cost for the remaining 26% of the Companys inventory at December31, 2011. For inventories where cost is determined by the LIFO method, the excess of the FIFO value over the LIFO value was $25.1million and $23.9million at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company provides estimated inventory reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future demand, market conditions, customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and related management initiatives.
45 Table of Contents AMETEK, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for additions to plant facilities, or that extend their useful lives, are capitalized. The cost of minor tools, jigs and dies, and maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The range of lives for depreciable assets is generally three to tenyears for machinery and equipment, five to 27years for leasehold improvements and 25 to 50years for buildings.
Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, under which title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. The policy, with respect to sales returns and allowances, generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances, except at the Companys option. The Company has agreements with distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return for unsold products. The distributor purchases the product from the Company, at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the distributor. The Company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume discounts. The Company accounts for these sales incentives as a reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized in the income statement. Accruals for sales returns, other allowances and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time revenue is recognized based upon past experience. At December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the accrual for future warranty obligations was $22.5million, $18.3million and $16.0million, respectively. The Companys expense for warranty obligations was $13.2million in 2011, $10.6million in 2010 and $8.2million in 2009. The warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the Companys operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses.
Research and Development Company-funded research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $78.0million in 2011, $56.8million in 2010 and $50.5million in 2009.
Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales and were $35.9million in 2011, $33.3million in 2010 and $24.6million in 2009.
46 Table of Contents AMETEK, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Earnings Per Share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares considered outstanding during the periods. The calculation of diluted earnings per share reflects the effect of all potentially dilutive securities (principally outstanding stock options and restricted stock grants). The number of weighted average shares used in the calculation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share was as follows for the years ended December31: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Weighted average shares: Basic shares 160,255 159,056 160,182 Equity-based compensation plans 1,853 1,828 1,593 Diluted shares 162,108 160,884 161,775 Financial Instruments and Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and their results of operations are translated using average exchange rates for the year. Certain transactions of the Company and its subsidiaries are made in currencies other than their functional currency. Exchange gains and losses from those transactions are included in operating results for the year.
The Company makes infrequent use of derivative financial instruments. Forward contracts are entered into from time to time to hedge specific firm commitments for certain inventory purchases or export sales, thereby minimizing the Companys exposure to raw material commodity price or foreign currency fluctuation. No forward contracts were outstanding at December31, 2011 or 2010. In instances where transactions are designated as hedges of an underlying item, the gains and losses on those transactions are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) within stockholders equity to the extent they are effective as hedges. The Company has designated certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term borrowings as hedges of the net investment in certain foreign operations. As of December31, 2011, these net investment hedges are the Companys British-pound-denominated long-term debts, pertaining to certain of its investments in 100% owned subsidiaries whose functional currency is the British pound. As of December 31, 2010, these net investment hedges included the British-pound- and Euro-denominated long-term debts. These borrowings were designed to create net investment hedges in each of the foreign subsidiaries. The Company designated the British-pound- and Euro-denominated loans referred to above as hedging instruments to offset translation gains or losses on the net investment due to changes in the British pound and Euro exchange rates. These net investment hedges were evidenced by managements documentation supporting the contemporaneous hedge designation on the acquisition dates. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument (the debt) following hedge designation, is reported in AOCI in the same manner as the translation adjustment on the investment based on changes in the spot rate, which is used to measure hedge effectiveness. As of December31, 2011 and 2010, all net investment hedges were effective. At December31, 2011, the translation losses on the net carrying value of the foreign-currency-denominated investments exceeded the translation gains on the carrying value of the underlying debt and the difference was included in AOCI. At December31, 2010, the translation losses on the net carrying value of the foreign-currency-denominated investments exceeded the translation gains on the carrying value of the underlying debt and the difference was included in AOCI. An evaluation of hedge effectiveness is performed by the Company on an ongoing basis and any changes in the hedge are made as appropriate. See Note 4.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Share-Based Compensation The Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, CompensationStock Compensation.
Accordingly, the Company expenses the fair value of awards made under its share-based plans. That cost is recognized in the consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period of the grants. See Note 11.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually.
The Company identifies its reporting units at the component level, which is one level below our operating segments. Generally, goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides. Our reporting units are composed of business units and are one level below our operating segment and for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.
The Company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate. The Company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sales transaction. The annual goodwill impairment test requires the Company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization and working capital requirements, which are based upon the Companys long-range plan. The Companys long-range plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk premium. While the Company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances.
The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method. The fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
The Company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2011, 2010 and 2009 and determined that the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives were not impaired.
The Company evaluates impairment of its long-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset group are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset group. Fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group. Losses on long-lived assets held for sale, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for disposal costs.
48 Table of Contents AMETEK, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Intangible assets, other than goodwill, with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Patents are being amortized over useful lives of four to 20years. Customer relationships are being amortized over a period of five to 20years. Miscellaneous other intangible assets are being amortized over a period of three to 20years. The Company periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the estimated useful lives of these intangible assets.
Income Taxes The Companys annual provision for income taxes and determination of the related balance sheet accounts requires management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. The Company conducts a broad range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the Companys tax assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to the Companys tax assets and liabilities may be necessary. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.
The Company also is required to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets, taking into consideration the Companys forecast of future taxable income, the reversal of other existing temporary differences, available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and amount of, valuation allowances against the Companys deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASU2010-06). ASU2010-06 provides amendments that clarify existing disclosures and require new disclosures related to fair value measurements, providing greater disaggregated information on each class of assets and liabilities and more robust disclosures on transfers between levels 1 and 2, and activity in level 3 fair value measurements. The Company adopted the applicable provisions within ASU2010-06 effective January1, 2010. The Company adopted the level 3 disclosure requirements of ASU2010-06 that are effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years as of January1, 2011. The adoption of ASU2010-06 did not have a significant impact on the Companys fair value disclosures.
In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No.2010-17, Revenue Recognition  Milestone Method (ASU2010-17). ASU2010-17 establishes criteria for a milestone to be considered substantive and allows revenue recognition when the milestone is achieved in research or development arrangements. In addition, it requires disclosure of certain information with respect to arrangements that contain milestones. ASU2010-17 was effective on January1, 2011 for the Company and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No.2010-29, Business Combinations (ASU2010-29). ASU2010-29 addresses diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma disclosure requirement for business combinations. ASU2010-29 requires disclosure of pro forma revenue and earnings for the current reporting period as though the acquisition date for all business combinations that occurred during the year had been as of the beginning of the annual reporting period for both the current and any comparable periods reported. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements of ASU2010-29 effective January1, 2011. See Note5.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No.2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (ASU2011-04). ASU2011-04 amendments result in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between U.S.GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). ASU 2011-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2011. The Company has evaluated ASU2011-04 and does not expect its adoption will have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No.2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU2011-05). ASU2011-05 requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income and the total of comprehensive income. These amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU2011-05 that is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2011 and does not expect its adoption to impact the Companys consolidated financial statements other than the change in presentation.
In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No.2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment (ASU2011-08). The amendments in ASU2011-08 permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 350, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other . ASU2011-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of adopting ASU 2011-08 and intends to adopt ASU 2011-08 for the year ending December31, 2012.

Fair Value Measurement Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
The Company utilizes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to the valuations used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows. Level1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Companys own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset or liabilitys classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
At December31, 2011, $0.2million of the Companys marketable securities are valued as level1 investments. In addition, the Company held $4.4million of marketable securities in an institutional diversified equity securities mutual fund. These securities are valued as level2 investments. The marketable securities are shown as a separate line on the consolidated balance sheet. For the year ended December31, 2011, gains and losses on the investments noted above were not significant. No transfers between level1 and level2 investments occurred during the year ended December31, 2011.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Fair value of the institutional equity securities mutual fund was estimated using the net asset value of the Companys ownership interests in the funds capital. The mutual fund seeks to provide long-term growth of capital by investing primarily in equity securities traded on U.S. exchanges and issued by large, established companies across many business sectors. There are no restrictions on the Companys ability to redeem these equity securities investments.

Hedging Activities The Company has designated certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term borrowings as hedges of the net investment in certain foreign operations. As of December31, 2011, these net investment hedges are the Companys British-pound-denominated long-term debt, pertaining to certain of its investments in 100% owned subsidiaries whose functional currency is the British pound. As of December 31, 2010, these net investment hedges included the British-pound- and Euro-denominated long-term debts. These borrowings were designed to create net investment hedges in each of the foreign subsidiaries. The Company designated the British-pound- and Euro-denominated loans referred to above as hedging instruments to offset translation gains or losses on the net investment due to changes in the British pound and Euro exchange rates. These net investment hedges were evidenced by managements documentation supporting the contemporaneous hedge designation on the acquisition dates. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument (the debt) following hedge designation is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in the same manner as the translation adjustment on the investment based on changes in the spot rate, which is used to measure hedge effectiveness.
At December31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had $186.5million and $187.2million, respectively, of British-pound-denominated loans, which are designated as a hedge against the net investment in foreign subsidiaries acquired in 2008, 2006, 2004 and 2003. At December31, 2010, the Company had a $66.9million Euro-denominated loan, which was designated as a hedge against the net investment in a foreign subsidiary acquired in 2005. As a result of these British-pound- and Euro-denominated loans being designated and effective as net investment hedges, $0.7million and $9.9million of currency remeasurement gains have been included in the foreign currency translation component of other comprehensive income at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

The 2011 acquisitions noted above had an immaterial impact on reported net sales, net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December31, 2011. Had the 2011 acquisitions been made at the beginning of 2011 or 2010, unaudited pro forma net sales, net income and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, would not have been materially different than the amounts reported. Pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred if the acquisitions had been completed at the beginning of 2011 or 2010.
In 2009, the Company spent $72.9million in cash, net of cash acquired, to acquire High Standard Aviation in January 2009, a small acquisition of two businesses in India, Unispec Marketing Pvt.

Upon distribution of those earnings to the United States, the Company would be subject to U.S.income taxes and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable. At December31, 2010, the Company had $5.7million of deferred income taxes for undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S.subsidiaries that were distributed during 2011.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) At December31, 2011, the Company had tax benefits of $3.5million related to net operating loss carryforwards, which will be available to offset future income taxes payable, subject to certain annual or other limitations based on foreign and U.S. tax laws. This amount includes net operating loss carryforwards of $0.2million for federal income tax purposes with no valuation allowance, $3.0million for state income tax purposes with a valuation allowance of $0.1million, and $0.3million for foreign income tax purposes with no valuation allowance. These net operating loss carryforwards, if not used, will expire between 2012 and 2032. As of December31, 2011, the Company had $0.3million of U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards.
The Company maintains a valuation allowance to reduce certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets established for state tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards. In 2011, the Company recorded a decrease of $4.7million in the valuation allowance primarily related to a reduction for net operating losses that are no longer available as well as a valuation allowance related to state research and development credits that are now expected to be utilized.
At December31, 2011, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $28.5million, of which $25.9million, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. At December31, 2010, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $22.8million, of which $18.3million, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate.
At December31, 2011 and 2010, the Company reported $7.2million and $6.1million, respectively, related to interest and penalty exposure as accrued income tax expense in the consolidated balance sheet. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recognized $1.1million of expense, $1.9million of expense and $0.7million of income, respectively, for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the income statement as a component of income tax expense.
The most significant tax jurisdiction for the Company is the United States. The Company files income tax returns in various state and foreign tax jurisdictions, in some cases for multiple legal entities per jurisdiction. Generally, the Company has open tax years subject to tax audit on average of between three and six years in these jurisdictions. At December31, 2011, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has been and is continuing to examine the Companys U.S. income tax returns for the years 2006 through 2009. The IRS previously completed the examination of the Companys U.S. income tax returns for the years 2006 and 2007, however, the periods were reopened by the Company for a limited scope examination of the research and development credit. The Company has not materially extended any other statutes of limitation for any significant location and has reviewed and accrued for, where necessary, tax liabilities for open periods including state and foreign jurisdictions that remain subject to examination. There have been no penalties asserted or imposed by the IRS related to substantial understatement of income, gross valuation misstatement or failure to disclose a listed or reportable transaction.
During 2011, the Company added $9.6million of tax, interest and penalties related to 2011 activity for identified uncertain tax positions and reversed $2.9million of tax and interest related to statute expirations and settlement of prior uncertain positions. During 2010, the Company added $5.4million of tax, interest and penalties related to 2010 activity for identified uncertain tax positions and reversed $8.4million of tax and interest related to statute expirations and settlement of prior uncertain positions.

At December31, 2011, tax, interest and penalties of $30.4million were classified as a noncurrent liability. The net increase in uncertain tax positions for the year ended December31, 2011 resulted in an increase to income tax expense of $3.2million.

The fair value of short-term borrowings approximates the carrying value. The Companys long-term debt is all privately held with no public market for this debt, therefore, the fair value of long-term debt was computed based on comparable current market data for similar debt instruments. See Note 9 for long-term debt principals, interest rates and maturities.

Share-Based Compensation Under the terms of the Companys stockholder-approved share-based plans, incentive and non-qualified stock options and restricted stock have been, and may be, issued to the Companys officers, management-level employees and members of its Board of Directors. Employee and non-employee director stock options generally vest at a rate of 25%per year, beginning one year from the date of the grant, and restricted stock generally has a four-year cliff vesting. Stock options generally have a maximum contractual term of seven years. At December31, 2011, 15.4million shares of Company common stock were reserved for issuance under the Companys share-based plans, including 5.5million shares for stock options outstanding.
The Company issues previously unissued shares when stock options are exercised and shares are issued from treasury stock upon the award of restricted stock.
The Company measures and records compensation expense related to all stock awards by recognizing the grant date fair value of the awards over their requisite service periods in the financial statements. For grants under any of the Companys plans that are subject to graded vesting over a service period, the Company recognizes expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.
The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes-Merton model to estimate the fair values of options granted during the years indicated: 2011 2010 2009 Expected volatility 26.4 % 25.6 % 25.8 % Expected term (years) 5.0 5.0 4.9 Risk-free interest rate 1.96 % 2.48 % 1.89 % Expected dividend yield 0.54 % 0.54 % 0.73 % Black-Scholes-Merton fair value per stock option granted $ 11.34 $ 7.56 $ 5.20 61 Table of Contents AMETEK, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock. The Company used historical exercise data to estimate the stock options expected term, which represents the period of time that the stock options granted are expected to be outstanding. Management anticipates that the future stock option holding periods will be similar to the historical stock option holding periods. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time of grant. Compensation expense recognized for all share-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The Companys estimated forfeiture rates are based on its historical experience.
Total share-based compensation expense was as follows for the years ended December31: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Stock option expense $ 8,027 $ 7,580 $ 6,297 Restricted stock expense 14,120 9,016 7,205 Total pre-tax expense 22,147 16,596 13,502 Related tax benefit (7,083 ) (5,459 ) (4,223 ) Reduction of net income $ 15,064 $ 11,137 $ 9,279 Pre-tax share-based compensation expense is included in either cost of sales, or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on where the recipients cash compensation is reported.

The fair value of restricted shares under the Companys restricted stock arrangement is determined by the product of the number of shares granted and the grant date market price of the Companys common stock. Upon the grant of restricted stock, the fair value of the restricted shares (unearned compensation) at the date of grant is charged as a reduction of capital in excess of par value in the Companys consolidated balance sheet and is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is the same as the calculated derived service period as determined on the grant date.
Restricted stock grants are subject to accelerated vesting due to certain events, including doubling of the grant price of the Companys common stock as of the close of business during any five consecutive trading days. On April6, 2011, 509,709shares of restricted stock, which were granted on April23, 2009, vested under this accelerated vesting provision. The pre-tax charge to income due to the accelerated vesting of these shares was $5.2million ($3.6million net after-tax charge) for the year ended December31, 2011.

Under a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) in 2011, the Company reserved 34,988shares of common stock. Reductions for retirements and terminations were 12,667shares in 2011. The total number of shares of common stock reserved under the SERP was 445,488 as of December31, 2011. Charges to expense under the SERP are not significant in amount and are considered pension expense with the offsetting credit reflected in capital in excess of par value.

Retirement Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits Retirement and Pension Plans The Company sponsors several retirement and pension plans covering eligible salaried and hourly employees. The plans generally provide benefits based on participants years of service and/or compensation. The following is a brief description of the Companys retirement and pension plans.
The Company maintains contributory and noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. Benefits for eligible salaried and hourly employees under all defined benefit plans are funded through trusts established in conjunction with the plans. The Companys funding policy with respect to its defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts that provide for benefits based on actuarial calculations and the applicable requirements of U.S. federal and local foreign laws. The Company estimates that it will make both required and discretionary cash contributions of approximately $3million to $6million to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans in 2012.
The Company uses a measurement date of December31 (its fiscal year end) for its U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension plans.
The Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement and savings plan for eligible U.S. employees. Participants in the retirement and savings plan may contribute a specified portion of their compensation on a before-tax basis, which vary by location. The Company matches employee contributions ranging from 20% to 100%, up to a maximum percentage ranging from 1% to 8% of eligible compensation or up to a maximum of $1,200 per participant in some locations.
The Companys retirement and savings plan has a defined contribution retirement feature principally to cover U.S. salaried employees joining the Company after December31, 1996. Under the retirement feature, the Company makes contributions for eligible employees based on a pre-established percentage of the covered employees salary subject to pre-established vesting. Employees of certain of the Companys foreign operations participate in various local defined contribution plans.
The Company has nonqualified unfunded retirement plans for its Directors and certain retired employees. It also provides supplemental retirement benefits, through contractual arrangements and/or a SERP covering certain current and former executives of the Company. These supplemental benefits are designed to compensate the executive for retirement benefits that would have been provided under the Companys primary retirement plan, except for statutory limitations on compensation that must be taken into account under those plans. The projected benefit obligations of the SERP and the contracts will primarily be funded by a grant of shares of the Companys common stock upon retirement or termination of the executive. The Company is providing for these obligations by charges to earnings over the applicable periods.

For U.S. equity securities and global equity securities not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.
Additionally, some U.S. equity securities and global equity securities are public investment vehicles valued using the Net Asset Value (NAV) provided by the fund manager. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of shares outstanding.

Equity securities included 626,324 shares of AMETEK, Inc. common stock with a market value of $26.4million (6.0% of total plan investment assets) at December31, 2011 and 861,300shares of AMETEK, Inc. common stock with a market value of $33.8million (7.3% of total plan investment assets) at December31, 2010.
The objectives of the AMETEK, Inc. U.S. defined benefit plans investment strategy are to maximize the plans funded status and minimize Company contributions and plan expense. Because the goal is to optimize returns over the long term, an investment policy that favors equity holdings has been established. Since there may be periods of time where both equity and fixed-income markets provide poor returns, an allocation to alternative assets may be made to improve the overall portfolios diversification and return potential. The Company periodically reviews its asset allocation, taking into consideration plan liabilities, plan benefit payment streams and the investment strategy of the pension plans. The actual asset allocation is monitored frequently relative to the established targets and ranges and is rebalanced when necessary. The target allocations for the U.S. defined benefits plans are approximately 50% equity securities, 25% fixed-income securities and 25% other securities and/or cash.
The equity portfolio is diversified by market capitalization and style. The equity portfolio also includes an international component.
68 Table of Contents AMETEK, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) The objective of the fixed-income portion of the pension assets is to provide interest rate sensitivity for a portion of the assets and to provide diversification. The fixed-income portfolio is diversified within certain quality and maturity guidelines in an attempt to minimize the adverse effects of interest rate fluctuations.
Other than for investments in alternative assets, described in the footnote to the table above, certain investments are prohibited. Prohibited investments include venture capital, private placements, unregistered or restricted stock, margin trading, commodities, short selling and rights and warrants. Foreign currency futures, options and forward contracts may be used to manage foreign currency exposure.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) The objective of AMETEK, Inc.s foreign defined benefit plans investment strategy is to maximize the long-term rate of return on plan investments, subject to a reasonable level of risk. Liability studies are also performed on a regular basis to provide guidance in setting investment goals with an objective to balance risks against the current and future needs of the plans. The trustees consider the risk associated with the different asset classes, relative to the plans liabilities and how this can be affected by diversification, and the relative returns available on equities, fixed-income investments, real estate and cash. Also, the likely volatility of those returns and the cash flow requirements of the plans are considered. It is expected that equities will outperform fixed-income investments over the long term. However, the trustees recognize the fact that fixed-income investments may better match the liabilities for pensioners. Because of the relatively young active employee group covered by the plans and the immature nature of the plans, the trustees have chosen to adopt an asset allocation strategy more heavily weighted toward equity investments. This asset allocation strategy will be reviewed, from time to time, in view of changes in market conditions and in the plans liability profile. The target allocations for the foreign defined benefit plans are approximately 74% equity securities, 17% fixed-income securities and 9% other securities, insurance or cash.
The assumption for the expected return on plan assets was developed based on a review of historical investment returns for the investment categories for the defined benefit pension assets. This review also considered current capital market conditions and projected future investment returns. The estimates of future capital market returns by asset class are lower than the actual long-term historical returns. The current low interest rate environment influences this outlook. Therefore, the assumed rate of return for U.S. plans is 8.0% and 6.96% for foreign plans in 2012.
The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with a projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets and pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets were as follows at December31: U.S. Defined Benefit Pension Plans: Projected Benefit ObligationExceeds FairValueofAssets Accumulated Benefit ObligationExceeds FairValueofAssets 2011 2010 2011 2010 (In thousands) Benefit obligation $ 5,558 $ 4,757 $ 5,558 $ 4,757 Fair value of plan assets     Foreign Defined Benefit Pension Plans: Projected Benefit Obligation Exceeds Fair Value of Assets Accumulated Benefit Obligation Exceeds FairValueofAssets 2011 2010 2011 2010 (In thousands) Benefit obligation $ 61,580 $ 59,966 $ 7,871 $ 9,612 Fair value of plan assets 50,125 51,040 467 2,057 70 Table of Contents AMETEK, Inc.

Future benefit payments primarily represent amounts to be paid from pension trust assets. Amounts included that are to be paid from the Companys assets are not significant in any individual year.
Postretirement Plans and Postemployment Benefits The Company provides limited postretirement benefits other than pensions for certain retirees and a small number of former employees. Benefits under these arrangements are not funded and are not significant.
The Company also provides limited postemployment benefits for certain former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement. Those benefits are not significant in amount.
The Company has a deferred compensation plan, which allows employees whose compensation exceeds the statutory IRS limit for retirement benefits to defer a portion of earned bonus compensation. The plan permits deferred amounts to be deemed invested in either, or a combination of, (a)an interest-bearing account, benefits from which are payable out of the general assets of the Company, or (b)the equivalent of a fund which invests in shares of the Companys common stock on behalf of the employee. The amount deferred under the plan, including income earned, was $19.5million and $16.9million at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Administrative expense for the deferred compensation plan is borne by the Company and is not significant.
13.
Guarantees The Company does not provide significant guarantees on a routine basis. The Company primarily issues guarantees, stand-by letters of credit and surety bonds in the ordinary course of its business to provide financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries to support or enhance the subsidiarys stand-alone creditworthiness. The amounts subject to certain of these agreements vary depending on the covered contracts actually outstanding at any particular point in time. At December31, 2011, the maximum amount of future payment obligations relative to these various guarantees was $64.7million and the outstanding liability under certain of those guarantees was $4.1million.
Indemnifications In conjunction with certain acquisition and divestiture transactions, the Company may agree to make payments to compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified events (e.g., breaches of contract obligations or retention of previously existing environmental, tax or employee liabilities) whose terms range in duration and often are not explicitly defined. Where appropriate, the obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Because the amount of these types of indemnifications generally is not specifically stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Further, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers for claims against them in connection with their positions with the Company. Historically, any such costs incurred to settle claims related to these indemnifications have been minimal for the Company. The Company believes that future payments, if any, under all existing indemnification agreements would not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Product Warranties The Company provides limited warranties in connection with the sale of its products. The warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the Companys operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses.
Changes in the accrued product warranty obligation were as follows at December31: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Balance at the beginning of the year $ 18,347 $ 16,035 $ 16,068 Accruals for warranties issued during the year 13,247 10,616 8,236 Settlements made during the year (10,175 ) (9,691 ) (11,095 ) Changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations during the year  (262 ) 277 Warranty accruals related to acquired businesses and other during the year 1,047 1,649 2,549 Balance at the end of the year $ 22,466 $ 18,347 $ 16,035 Certain settlements of warranties made during the period were for specific nonrecurring warranty obligations. Product warranty obligations are reported as current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
14.
Contingencies Environmental Matters Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations. At December31, 2011, the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at 15 non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the non-owned sites). The Company is identified as a de minimis party in 14 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In ten of these sites, the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount. At the remaining site where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the Companys expected obligations. The Company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations (the owned sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements; 74 Table of Contents AMETEK, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements. In estimating the Companys liability for remediation, the Company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.
Total environmental reserves at December31, 2011 and 2010 were $28.0million and $31.3million, respectively, for both non-owned and owned sites. In 2011, the Company recorded $1.2million in reserves. Additionally, the Company spent $4.5million on environmental matters in 2011. The Companys reserves for environmental liabilities at December31, 2011 and 2010 include reserves of $17.5million and $18.9million, respectively, for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of HCC Industries (HCC). The Company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a large Superfund site in the San Gabriel Valley of California. The Company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required remedial activities. At December31, 2011, the Company had $14.3million in receivables related to HCC for probable recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed third-party funds to support the required remediation. Also, the Company is indemnified by HCCs former owners for approximately $19.0million of additional costs.
The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in all material respects.
The Company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. The Company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.

Leases and Other Commitments Minimum aggregate rental commitments under noncancellable leases in effect at December31, 2011 (principally for production and administrative facilities and equipment) amounted to $131.3million, consisting of payments of $27.0million in 2012, $20.9million in 2013, $16.1million in 2014, $13.1million in 2015, $10.1million in 2016 and $44.1million thereafter. The leases expire over a range of years from 2012 to 2082, with renewal or purchase options, subject to various terms and conditions, contained in most of the leases. Rental expense was $26.4million in 2011, $23.1million in 2010 and $22.8million in 2009.
As of December31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had $275.5million and $222.0million, respectively, in purchase obligations outstanding, which primarily consisted of contractual commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed prices.

In 2011, the Company repurchased approximately 1,677,000shares of common stock for $59.3million in cash under its share repurchase authorization. In November 2011, the Board of Directors approved an increase of $100million in the authorization for the repurchase of the Companys common stock. This increase was added to the $5.5million that remained available from an existing $75 million authorization approved in 2010. At December31, 2011, $105.5million was available under the Board authorization for future share repurchases.
At December31, 2011, the Company held 8.8million shares in its treasury at a cost of $209.8million, compared with 7.3million shares at a cost of $153.6million at December31, 2010. The number of shares outstanding at December31, 2011 was 160.4million shares, compared with 160.7million shares at December31, 2010.
The Company has a Shareholder Rights Plan, under which the Companys Board of Directors declared a dividend of one Right for each share of Company common stock owned at the close of business on June2, 2007, and has authorized the issuance of one Right for each share of common stock of the Company issued between the Record Date and the Distribution Date. The Plan provides, under certain conditions involving acquisition of the Companys common stock, that holders of Rights, except for the acquiring entity, would be entitled (i)to purchase shares of preferred stock at a specified exercise price, or (ii)to purchase shares of common stock of the Company, or the acquiring company, having a value of twice the Rights exercise price. The Rights under the Plan expire in June2017.

Fourth Quarter of 2008 Restructuring Charges and Asset Write-Downs During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded pre-tax charges totaling $40.0million, which had the effect of reducing net income by $27.3million ($0.17 per diluted share). These charges included restructuring costs for employee reductions and facility closures ($32.6million), as well as asset write-downs ($7.4million). The charges included $30.1million for severance costs for more than 10% of the Companys workforce and $1.5million for lease termination costs associated with the closure of certain facilities. Of the $40.0million in charges, $32.9million of the restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded in cost of sales and $7.1million of the restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. The restructuring charges and asset write-downs were reported in 2008 segment operating income as follows: $20.4million in EIG, $19.4million in EMG and $0.2million in Corporate administrative and other expenses. The restructuring costs for employee reductions and facility closures relate to plans established by the Company in 2008 as part of cost reduction initiatives that were broadly implemented across the Companys various businesses during fiscal 2009. The restructuring costs resulted from the consolidation of manufacturing facilities, the migration of production to low-cost locales and a general reduction in workforce in response to lower levels of expected sales volumes in certain of the Companys businesses.
