All such expenditures were directed toward the development of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and processes.
Environmental Matters Information with respect to environmental matters is set forth in the section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations entitled Environmental Matters and in Note14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in PartII, Item8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Patents, Licenses and Trademarks The Company owns numerous unexpired U.S. patents and foreign patents, including counterparts of its more important U.S. patents, in the major industrial countries of the world. The Company is a licensor or licensee under patent agreements of various types and its products are marketed under various registered and unregistered U.S. and foreign trademarks and trade names. However, the Company does not consider any single patent or trademark, or any group thereof, essential either to its business as a whole or to either of its reportable segments. The annual royalties received or paid under license agreements are not significant to either of its reportable segments or to the Companys overall operations.
Employees At December31, 2012, the Company employed approximately 13,700people in its EMG, EIG and corporate operations, of whom approximately 2,700employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company has two collective bargaining agreements that will expire in 2013, which cover less than 200 employees. The Company expects no material adverse effects from the pending labor contract negotiations.
Working Capital Practices The Company does not have extraordinary working capital requirements in either of its reportable segments. Customers generally are billed at normal trade terms, which may include extended payment provisions. Inventories are closely controlled and maintained at levels related to production cycles and are responsive to the normal delivery requirements of customers.
Item1A.
Risk Factors You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form10-K and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual Report on Form10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
A prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process instrumentation or power markets could adversely affect our business.
Several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control. A prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
11 Table of Contents Our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions.
A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses. Since the beginning of 2008, through December31, 2012, we have completed 27acquisitions. We plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Although we have been successful with our acquisition strategies in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors, including:  Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;  The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase acquisition costs and affect our ability to consummate acquisitions on favorable terms and may result in us assuming a greater portion of the sellers liabilities;  Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including integrating the financial, technological and management processes, procedures and controls of the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations;  Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms acceptable to us;  U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations affecting our ability to make certain acquisitions;  Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of acquired businesses;  Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and  Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.
The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Furthermore, even if successfully integrated, the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned. Failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We may experience unanticipated start-up expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or product line transfers.
Certain of our businesses are relocating or have recently relocated manufacturing operations to low-cost locales. Unanticipated start-up expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or completing product line transfers, as well as possible underutilization of our existing facilities, could result in production inefficiencies, which would adversely affect our business and operations.
Our substantial international sales and operations are subject to customary risks associated with international operations.
International sales for 2012 and 2011 represented 51.2% and 50.2% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. As a result of our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the United States will increase in the future. Approximately half of our international sales are of products manufactured outside the United States. We have manufacturing operations in 16 countries outside the United States, with significant operations in China, the Czech Republic and Mexico. A prolonged disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goods from these countries could have a material adverse effect on our operations. International operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment, including: 12 Table of Contents  Potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions;  Overlap of different tax structures;  Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;  Changes in tariffs and trade barriers;  Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate, subjecting us to exchange rate exposures;  Restrictions on currency repatriation;  General economic conditions;  Unstable political situations;  Nationalization of assets; and  Compliance with a wide variety of international and U.S. laws and regulatory requirements.
Our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws.
We are required to comply with various import, export, export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation.
Any inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully.
If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses, manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations.
If we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects.
We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards. Although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. We are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete, although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products.
13 Table of Contents A shortage of, or price increases for, our raw materials could increase our operating costs.
We have multiple sources of supply for our major raw material requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier; however, certain items, including base metals and certain steel components, are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations. Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance clean-up which may adversely affect our financial condition.
Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, air emissions, discharges to waters and the use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous materials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act generally imposes joint and several liability for clean-up costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for clean-up under the Act. We have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites, which are the subject of government-mandated clean-ups. As the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use, manufacture, store, handle and dispose of various hazardous materials, we may incur substantial costs for investigation, removal, remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws. While it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations, new classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities.
We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs.
Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws and regulations. In addition, existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations, including with respect to climate change, may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products. We cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations.
We may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with alleged or actual harm caused by our products.
We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property. For example, our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of, for instance, an aircraft component that has been designed, manufactured or serviced by us. We may incur a significant liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful. While we believe our current general liability and product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from future claims, we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate to cover all claims 14 Table of Contents that may arise. Additionally, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability not covered by insurance or for which third-party indemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business.
Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and internationally, with individual producers, as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have resources greater than we do. The principal elements of competition for our products are product technology, quality, service, distribution and price. EMGs competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes. In the markets served by EIG, although we believe EIG is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify. In the aerospace and heavy-vehicle markets served by EIG, a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality, performance and innovation. Our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers. There can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors.
Restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness.
Our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. These restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions or restrict our financial flexibility.
We are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties.
We engage in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies, letters of credit, credit facilities, financial derivatives and investment management agreements involving various counterparties. We are subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and, therefore, be unable to discharge its obligations under such contracts.
Our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial amount of our total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
Our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December31, 2012, goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $3,518.0million or 68% of our total assets. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. At a minimum, we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, we could record, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Properties At December31, 2012, the Company had 125 operating facilities in 24states and 16foreign countries. Of these facilities, 56are owned by the Company and 69are leased. The properties owned by the Company consist of approximately 606acres, of which approximately 4.6million square feet are under roof. Under lease is a total of approximately 2.6million square feet. The leases expire over a range of years from 2012 to 2082, with renewal options for varying terms contained in many of the leases. Production facilities in China, Japan and Taiwan provide the Company with additional production capacity through the Companys investment in 50% or less owned joint ventures. The Companys executive offices in Berwyn, Pennsylvania, occupy approximately 43,000square feet under a lease that expires in September2023.
The Companys machinery and equipment, plants and offices are in satisfactory operating condition and are adequate for the uses to which they are put. The operating facilities of the Company by reportable segment were as follows at December31, 2012: Number of Operating Facilities Square Feet Under Roof Owned Leased Owned Leased Electronic Instruments 26 34 1,932,000 1,539,000 Electromechanical 30 35 2,645,000 1,035,000 Total 56 69 4,577,000 2,574,000 Item3.
Legal Proceedings Please refer to Environmental Matters in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form10-K for information regarding certain litigation matters.
In addition to those litigation matters described above, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to its business. These lawsuits may involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Companys products and services, personal injury, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes and intellectual property matters. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions. Based upon the Companys experience, the Company does not believe that these proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with Item1A. Risk Factors, Item6. Selected Financial Data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Business Overview AMETEKs operations are affected by global, regional and industry economic factors. However, the Companys strategic geographic and industry diversification, and its mix of products and services, have helped to limit the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable developments in any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. In2012, the Company established records for orders, backlog, sales, operating income, operating income margins, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. Contributions from recent acquisitions, combined with successful Operational Excellence initiatives, had a positive impact on 2012results. The Company also benefited from its strategic initiatives under AMETEKs four growth strategies: Operational Excellence, New Product Development, Global and Market Expansion, and Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances. Highlights of 2012 were:  In 2012, net sales were $3.3billion, an increase of $344.3million or 11.5% from 2011, on contributions from the 2011 and 2012 acquisitions.
Net income for 2012 was $459.1million, an increase of $74.6million or 19.4%, compared with $384.5million in 2011.
During 2012, the Company completed the following acquisitions:  In January2012, the Company acquired OBrien Corporation, a leading manufacturer of fluid and gas handling solutions, sample conditioning equipment and process analyzers.
In May2012, the Company acquired Dunkermotoren GmbH, a leader in advanced motion control solutions for a wide range of industrial automation applications.

23 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the year ended December31, 2012 compared with the year ended December31, 2011 In 2012, the Company established records for orders, sales, operating income, operating income margins, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. The Company achieved these results through contributions from acquisitions completed in 2012 and the acquisitions of Technical Manufacturing Corporation (TMC) in December2011, EM Test (Switzerland) GmbH and Reichert Technologies in October2011, Coining Holding Company (Coining) in May2011 and Avicenna Technology, Inc. (Avicenna) in April2011, as well as our Operational Excellence initiatives. The full year impact of the 2012acquisitions and our continued focus on and implementation of Operational Excellence initiatives are expected to have a positive impact on our 2013results.
Net sales for 2012 were $3,334.2million, an increase of $344.3million or 11.5%, compared with net sales of $2,989.9million in 2011. Net sales for the Electronic Instruments Group (EIG) were $1,872.6million in 2012, an increase of 13.7% from net sales of $1,647.2million in 2011. Net sales for the Electromechanical Group (EMG) were $1,461.7million in 2012, an increase of 8.9% from net sales of $1,342.7million in 2011. The increase in net sales was attributable to higher order rates, as well as the impact of the acquisitions mentioned above. The net sales increase for 2012 included internal sales growth of approximately 1%, which excludes a 1% unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation. The acquisitions mentioned above contributed to the net sales increase.
Total international sales for 2012 were $1,707.6million or 51.2% of net sales, an increase of $206.5million or 13.8%, compared with international sales of $1,501.1million or 50.2% of net sales in 2011. The $206.5million increase in international sales resulted from the acquisitions mentioned above, primarily driven by Dunkermotoren, and includes the effect of foreign currency translation. Both reportable segments of the Company maintain strong international sales presences in Europe and Asia despite weakness in the global economy. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in total international sales, were $862.6million in 2012, an increase of $87.7million or 11.3%, compared with $774.9million in 2011. Export shipments improved due to increased exports from the 2012 and 2011 acquisitions noted above, excluding Dunkermotoren and EM Test.
New orders for 2012 were a record at $3,535.1million, an increase of $462.6million or 15.1%, compared with $3,072.5million in 2011. The increase in orders was primarily attributable to 2012 and 2011 acquisitions, excluding a 1%unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation. As a result, the Companys backlog of unfilled orders at December31, 2012 was a record at $1,112.3million, an increase of $200.9million or 22.0%, compared with $911.4million at December31, 2011.
Segment operating income for 2012 was $789.3million, an increase of $106.4million or 15.6%, compared with segment operating income of $682.9million in 2011. Segment operating income, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 23.7% in 2012, compared with 22.8% in 2011. The increase in segment operating income and segment operating margins resulted primarily from the benefits of the Companys lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for 2012 were $380.5million, an increase of $31.2million or 8.9%, compared with $349.3million in 2011. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 11.4% for 2012, compared with 11.7% in 2011. Selling expenses increased $34.7million or 11.4% for 2012 primarily driven by the increase in net sales noted above. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 10.1% for both 2012 and 2011. Base business selling expenses were essentially flat year over year, which was in line with internal sales growth.
Corporate administrative expenses for 2012 were $43.1million, a decrease of $3.5million or 7.5%, compared with $46.6million in 2011. The decrease in corporate administrative expenses was primarily driven by lower consulting and compensation-related expenses. As a percentage of net sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.3% for 2012, compared with 1.6% in 2011.
24 Table of Contents Consolidated operating income was $745.9million or 22.4% of net sales for 2012, an increase of $110.0million or 17.3%, compared with $635.9million or 21.3% of net sales in 2011.
Interest expense was $75.5million for 2012, an increase of $5.8million or 8.3%, compared with $69.7million in 2011. The increase was due to higher borrowings under revolving credit facilities and higher fees associated with the full year impact of the revolving credit facility signed in September 2011 primarily for the acquisitions previously mentioned, as well as the full year impact of the issuance of a 55million Swiss franc senior note in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Other expenses, net were $7.9million for 2012, a decrease of $1.7million, compared with $9.6million in 2011. The decrease was primarily driven by higher investment income, a favorable impact from foreign currency in 2012 and the non-recurrence of costs incurred to demolish a vacant facility in 2011.
The effective tax rate for 2012 was 30.7%, compared with 30.9% in 2011. The effective tax rate for 2012 and 2011 includes the impact of international statutory tax rate reductions and the ongoing benefits obtained from international tax planning initiatives. See Note9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in PartII, Item8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K for further details.
Net income for 2012 was $459.1million, an increase of $74.6million or 19.4%, compared with $384.5million in 2011. Diluted earnings per share for 2012 were $1.88, an increase of $0.30 or 19.0%, compared with $1.58 per diluted share in 2011.
Segment Results EIGs net sales totaled $1,872.6million for 2012, an increase of $225.4million or 13.7%, compared with $1,647.2million in 2011. The net sales increase was due to internal growth of approximately 3%, excluding an unfavorable 1% effect of foreign currency translation, primarily driven by increases in EIGs oil and gas, aerospace and power businesses. The acquisitions of Micro-Poise, OBrien, TMC, EM Test and Reichert Technologies accounted for the remainder of the net sales increase.
EIGs operating income was $497.1million for 2012, an increase of $76.9million or 18.3%, compared with $420.2million in 2011. EIGs operating margins were 26.5% of net sales for 2012, compared with 25.5% of net sales in 2011. The increase in segment operating income and operating margins was driven by the leveraged impact of the Groups increase in internal sales growth noted above, as well as the benefit of the Groups lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives.
EMGs net sales totaled $1,461.7million for 2012, an increase of $119.0million or 8.9%, compared with $1,342.7million in 2011. The net sales increase was due to the acquisitions of Dunkermotoren, Coining and Avicenna, partially offset by an internal sales decline of 1% and an unfavorable 1% effect of foreign currency translation.
EMGs operating income was $292.2million for 2012, an increase of $29.5million or 11.2%, compared with $262.7million in 2011. EMGs operating margins were 20.0% of net sales for 2012, compared with 19.6% of net sales in 2011. EMGs increase in operating income and operating margins was primarily due to the benefit of the Groups lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives.
25 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the year ended December31, 2011 compared with the year ended December31, 2010 In 2011, the Company established records for sales, operating income, operating income margins, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. The Company achieved these results from strong internal growth in both EIG and EMG, as well as contributions from acquisitions completed in 2011 and the acquisitions of Technical Services for Electronics (TSE) in June2010, Haydon Enterprises in July2010 and Atlas Material Testing Technology LLC (Atlas) in November2010.

Net sales for EMG were $1,342.7million in 2011, an increase of 17.1% from net sales of $1,146.8million in 2010. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to higher order rates, as well as the impact of the acquisitions mentioned above. The net sales increase for 2011 was driven by strong internal sales growth of approximately 11%, which excludes a 1% favorable effect of foreign currency translation. The acquisitions mentioned above contributed the remainder of the net sales increase.
Total international sales for 2011 were $1,501.1million or 50.2% of net sales, an increase of $289.8million or 23.9%, compared with international sales of $1,211.3million or 49.0% of net sales in 2010. The $289.8million increase in international sales resulted from higher sales growth noted above, driven by continued strong expansion into Asia, as well as growth in Europe, and includes the effect of foreign currency translation. Both reportable segments of the Company maintain strong international sales presences in Europe and Asia. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in total international sales, were $774.9million in 2011, an increase of $210.4million or 37.3%, compared with $564.5million in 2010. Export shipments improved due to increased exports from both the base businesses and the acquisitions noted above.

SG&A expenses for 2011 were $349.3million, an increase of $52.8million or 17.8%, compared with $296.5million in 2010. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 11.7% for 2011, compared with 12.0% in 2010. A portion of the increase in SG&A expenses was the result of a $2.1million charge recorded in corporate administrative expenses related to the accelerated vesting of an April2009 restricted stock grant in the second quarter of 2011. Selling expenses increased $49.4million or 19.5% for 2011 driven by the increase in net sales noted above. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 10.1% for 2011, compared with 10.3% for 2010.

(5) The leases expire over a range of years from 2013 to 2082 with renewal or purchase options, subject to various terms and conditions, contained in most of the leases.
(6) Purchase obligations primarily consist of contractual commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed prices.
Other Commitments The Company has standby letters of credit and surety bonds of $38.1million related to performance and payment guarantees at December31, 2012. Based on experience with these arrangements, the Company believes that any obligations that may arise will not be material to its financial position.
29 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The Company has identified its critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ materially from the estimates used. The consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to the Companys accounting policies and to Managements Discussion and Analysis. The information that follows represents additional specific disclosures about the Companys accounting policies regarding risks, estimates, subjective decisions or assessments whereby materially different financial condition and results of operations could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions existed. Primary disclosure of the Companys significant accounting policies is in Note1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in PartII, Item8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Revenue Recognition.
The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, under which title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. The Companys policy, with respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances, except at the Companys option. The Company has agreements with distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return for unsold products. The distributor purchases the product from the Company, at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the distributor. The Company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume discounts. The Company accounts for the sales incentive as a reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized. Accruals for sales returns, other allowances and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time revenue is recognized based upon past experience. At December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the accrual for future warranty obligations was $27.8million, $22.5million and $18.3million, respectively. The Companys expense for warranty obligations was $10.1million, $13.2million and $10.6million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the Companys operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses. If actual future sales returns and allowances and warranty amounts are higher than past experience, additional accruals may be required.
Accounts Receivable.
The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of specific customers to meet their financial obligations to the Company. A specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against the amount due from these customers. For all other customers, the Company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the length of time specific receivables are past due based on its historical experience. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The allowance for possible losses on receivables was $10.8million and $7.8million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Inventories.
The Company uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of accounting, which approximates current replacement cost, for approximately 79% of its inventories at December31, 2012. The last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting is used to determine cost for the remaining 21% of its inventory at December31, 2012. For inventories where cost is determined by the LIFO method, the FIFO value would have been $25.4million and $25.1million higher than the LIFO value reported in the consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company provides estimated inventory reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future demand, market conditions, customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and related 30 Table of Contents management initiatives. If these factors are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory reserves may be required.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of the goodwill impairment test, the Company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units. The Company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen and went directly to performing the first step quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test in the current year. The Company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods. The first step in the quantitative process is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, then the second step must be completed, which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability, with the excess being implied goodwill. An impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. The Company would be required to record any such impairment losses.
The Company identifies its reporting units at the component level, which is one level below our operating segments. Generally, goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides. Our reporting units are composed of the business units one level below our operating segment at which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.
The Company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate. The Company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction. The annual goodwill impairment test requires the Company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization and working capital requirements, which are based upon the Companys long-range plan. The Companys long-range plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk premium. While the Company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. While there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions, the Companys overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value calculations, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease in fair values of each reporting unit. The 2012 results (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) showed that, despite the hypothetical 10% decrease in fair value, the fair values of the Companys reporting units still exceeded their respective carrying values by 53% to 490% for each of the Companys reporting units.
The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method. The Company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets. The fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
31 Table of Contents The Companys acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the Company expects to continue to make acquisitions. At December31, 2012, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $2,615.3 million or 50.4% of the Companys total assets. The Company performed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2012 and determined that the Companys goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles were not impaired. There can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future.
Other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of other intangible assets with finite lives is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those assets are less than the carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of those assets. Fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.
Pensions.
The Company has U.S.and foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. The most significant elements in determining the Companys pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. The pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be settled at the valuation date. At the end of each year, the Company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities. In estimating this rate for 2012, the Company considered rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income investments that have maturities consistent with the anticipated funding requirements of the plan. The discount rate used in determining the 2012 pension cost was 5.0% for U.S.defined benefit pension plans and 5.22% for foreign plans. The discount rate used for determining the funded status of the plans at December31, 2012 and determining the 2013 defined benefit pension cost was 4.1% for U.S.plans and 4.44% for foreign plans. In estimating the U.S. and foreigndiscount rates, the Companys actuaries developed a customized discount rate appropriate to the plans projected benefit cash flow based on yields derived from a database of long-term bonds at consistent maturity dates. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2012 of 8.0% for U.S.defined benefit pension plans and 6.96% for foreign plans. The Company will use 7.75% for the U.S. plans in 2013 and 6.91% for the foreign plans in 2013. The Company determines the expected long-term rate of return based primarily on its expectation of future returns for the pension plans investments. Additionally, the Company considers historical returns on comparable fixed-income and equity investments, and adjusts its estimate as deemed appropriate. The rate of compensation increase used in determining the 2012 pension expense for the U.S.plans was 3.75% and was 2.97% for the foreign plans. The U.S. rate of compensation increase will remain unchanged in 2013. The foreign plans rates of compensation increase will decrease slightly to 2.89% in 2013. In 2012, the Company recognized consolidated pre-tax pension expense of $2.3million from its U.S.and foreign defined benefit pension plans, compared with pre-tax pension income of $7.4million recognized for these plans in 2011. The Company estimates its 2013 U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension pre-tax expense to be approximately $1.3million.
All unrecognized prior service costs, remaining transition obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized, net of tax effects, as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost. The Company uses a December31 measurement date (the date at which plan assets and benefit obligations are measured) for its U.S. and foreigndefined benefit plans.
To fund the plans, the Company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2012, which totaled $4.3million, compared with $5.4million in 2011. The Company anticipates making approximately $2million to $5million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2013.
Income Taxes.
The process of providing for income taxes and determining the related balance sheet accounts requires management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize 32 Table of Contents estimates. The Company conducts a broad range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the Companys tax assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to the Companys tax assets and liabilities may be necessary.
The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets, taking into consideration the Companys forecast of future taxable income, available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and the amount of, valuation allowances against the Companys deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.
The Company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions, by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. Once the minimum threshold is met, using a more likely than not standard, a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit. The tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50% likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination. The underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes, published guidance, external expert opinion, or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past. There can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy, legislation and audit practice. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (ASU2011-04). ASU2011-04 amendments result in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between U.S.GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). ASU2011-04 was effective on January1, 2012 for the Company and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In June 2011, the FASB issued ASUNo.2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU2011-05). ASU2011-05 requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income and the total of comprehensive income. For interim periods, issuers are only required to provide a total of comprehensive income. These amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income. The Company adopted ASU2011-05 effective January1, 2012. See the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In September 2011, the FASB issued ASUNo.2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment (ASU2011-08). The amendments in ASU2011-08 permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic350, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other . ASU2011-08 was effective on January1, 2012 for the Company and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
33 Table of Contents In July 2012, the FASB issued ASUNo.2012-02, Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment (ASU2012-02). The amendments in ASU2012-02, similar to the amendments of ASU2011-08, permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test described in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic350, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other . ASU2012-02 is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September15, 2012. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU2012-02 to have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Internal Reinvestment Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $57.4million or 1.7% of net sales in 2012, compared with $50.8million or 1.7% of net sales in 2011. In 2012, 53% of the expenditures were for improvements to existing equipment or additional equipment to increase productivity and expand capacity. The Companys 2012 capital expenditures increased due to a continuing emphasis on spending to improve productivity and expand manufacturing capabilities. The 2013 capital expenditures are expected to approximate 1.8% of net sales, with a continued emphasis on spending to improve productivity.
Development and Engineering The Company is committed to research, development and engineering activities that are designed to identify and develop potential new and improved products or enhance existing products. Research, development and engineering costs before customer reimbursement were $154.8million, $137.6million and $112.1million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Customer reimbursements in 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $5.0million, $6.1million and $6.4million, respectively. These amounts included net Company-funded research and development expenses of $84.9million, $78.0million and $56.8million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. All such expenditures were directed toward the development of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and processes.
Environmental Matters Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations. The Company believes these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time. At December31, 2012, the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at 14 non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the non-owned sites). The Company is identified as a de minimis party in 13 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In nine of these sites, the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the deminimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount. At the remaining site where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the Companys expected obligations. The Company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations (the owned sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In 34 Table of Contents certain instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements. In estimating the Companys liability for remediation, the Company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.
Total environmental reserves at December31, 2012 and 2011 were $23.6million and $28.0million, respectively, for both non-owned and owned sites. In 2012, the Company recorded $0.7million in reserves. Additionally, the Company spent $5.1million on environmental matters in 2012. The Companys reserves for environmental liabilities at December31, 2012 and 2011 include reserves of $14.7million and $17.5million, respectively, for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of HCC Industries (HCC). The Company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a Superfund site in the SanGabriel Valley of California. The Company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required remedial activities. At December31, 2012, the Company had $11.3million in receivables related to HCC for probable recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed third-party funds to support the required remediation. Also, the Company is indemnified by HCCs former owners for approximately $19.0million of additional costs.
The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in all material respects.
The Company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. The Company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.
Market Risk The Companys primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which could impact its financial condition and results of operations. The Company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. The Companys differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating income as a whole.
The Companys short-term debt carries variable interest rates and generally its long-term debt carries fixed rates. These financial instruments are more fully described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in PartII, Item8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
The foreign currencies to which the Company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the Euro, the British pound, the Japanese Yen, the Chinese renminbi and the Mexican peso. Exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored, and when possible, mitigated through the use of local borrowings and occasional derivative financial instruments in the foreign country affected. The effect of translating foreign subsidiaries balance sheets into U.S.dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity. Foreign 35 Table of Contents currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the Company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies.
The primary commodities to which the Company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel, aluminum, copper, steel, titanium and gold. Exposure to price changes in these commodities are generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements, although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures.
Based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates, commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates, the Companys best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings, fair value of risk-sensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material, although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis.
Forward-Looking Information Certain matters discussed in this Form10-K are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the Companys operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in determining the Companys actual future results. The Company wishes to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA by cautioning readers that numerous important factors, in some cases have caused, and in the future could cause, the Companys actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. Some, but not all, of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under Item1A. Risk Factors. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise, unless required by the securities laws to do so.

37 Table of Contents Managements Responsibility for Financial Statements Management has prepared and is responsible for the integrity of the consolidated financial statements and related information. The statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied and include certain amounts based on managements best estimates and judgments. Historical financial information elsewhere in this report is consistent with that in the financial statements.
In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the financial information, management maintains a system of internal accounting and disclosure controls, including an internal audit program. The system of controls provides for appropriate division of responsibility and the application of written policies and procedures. That system, which undergoes continual reevaluation, is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and records are adequate for the preparation of reliable financial data.
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We maintain a system of internal controls that is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the fair and reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements; however, there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal controls.
Management recognizes its responsibility for conducting the Companys activities according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. That responsibility is characterized and reflected in a code of business conduct for all employees and in a financial code of ethics for the Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers, as well as in other key policy statements publicized throughout the Company.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent directors who are not employees of the Company, meets with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and management to satisfy itself that each is properly discharging its responsibilities. The report of the Audit Committee is included in the Companys Proxy Statement for the 2013Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Both the independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have direct access to the Audit Committee.
The Companys independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst& Young LLP, is engaged to render an opinion as to whether managements financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the Companys financial position and operating results. This report is included herein.
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rules13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012 based on the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2012.
The Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012 has been audited by Ernst&YoungLLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.
AMETEK, Inc.
February21, 2013 38 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of AMETEK, Inc.: We have audited AMETEK, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). AMETEK, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, AMETEK, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on the COSO criteria .
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of AMETEK, Inc. as of December31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2012, and our report dated February21, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of AMETEK, Inc. (the Company), and include the accounts of the Company and subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany transactions in the consolidation. The Companys investments in 50% or less owned joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. Such investments are not significant to the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash Equivalents, Securities and Other Investments All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents. At December31, 2012 and 2011, all of the Companys investments in equity securities and fixed-income securities (primarily those held by its captive insurance subsidiary) are classified as available-for-sale, although the Company may hold fixed-income securities until their maturity dates. Fixed-income securities generally mature within three years. The aggregate market value of equity and fixed-income securities at December31, 2012 and 2011 was $8.3million ($8.3million amortized cost) and $7.3million ($7.3million amortized cost), respectively. The temporary unrealized gain or loss on such securities is recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (in stockholders equity), and is not significant. Certain of the Companys other investments, which are not significant, are also accounted for by the equity method of accounting as discussed above.
Accounts Receivable The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of specific customers to meet their financial obligations to the Company. A specific reserve for doubtful receivables is recorded against the amount due from these customers. For all other customers, the Company recognizes reserves for doubtful receivables based on the length of time specific receivables are past due based on past experience. The allowance for possible losses on receivables was $10.8million and $7.8million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. See Note8.
Inventories The Company uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of accounting, which approximates current replacement cost, for 79% of its inventories at December31, 2012. The last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting is used to determine cost for the remaining 21% of the Companys inventory at December31, 2012. For inventories where cost is determined by the LIFO method, the excess of the FIFO value over the LIFO value was $25.4million and $25.1million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company provides estimated inventory reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future demand, market conditions, customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and related management initiatives.
46 Table of Contents AMETEK, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Business Combinations The Company allocates the purchase price of an acquired company, including when applicable, the fair value of contingent consideration between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values, with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of the acquired business are included in the Companys operating results from the date of acquisition. See Note 6.
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for additions to plant facilities, or that extend their useful lives, are capitalized. The cost of minor tools, jigs and dies, and maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The range of lives for depreciable assets is generally three to tenyears for machinery and equipment, five to 27years for leasehold improvements and 25 to 50years for buildings.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually.
The Company identifies its reporting units at the component level, which is one level below our operating segments. Generally, goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides. Our reporting units are composed of business units and are one level below our operating segment and for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.
The Company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate. The Company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sales transaction. The annual goodwill impairment test requires the Company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization and working capital requirements, which are based upon the Companys long-range plan. The Companys long-range plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk premium. While the Company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances.
The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method. The fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
47 Table of Contents AMETEK, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) The Company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2012, 2011 and 2010 and determined that the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives were not impaired.
The Company evaluates impairment of its long-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset group are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset group. Fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group. Losses on long-lived assets held for sale, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for disposal costs.
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Patents and technology are being amortized over useful lives of four to 20years, with a weighted average life of 16 years. Customer relationships are being amortized over a period of five to 20years, with a weighted average life of 19 years. Miscellaneous other intangible assets are being amortized over a period of three to 20years. The Company periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the estimated useful lives of these intangible assets.
Financial Instruments and Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and their results of operations are translated using average exchange rates for the year. Certain transactions of the Company and its subsidiaries are made in currencies other than their functional currency. Exchange gains and losses from those transactions are included in operating results for the year.
The Company makes infrequent use of derivative financial instruments. Forward contracts are entered into from time to time to hedge specific firm commitments for certain inventory purchases, export sales or debt, thereby minimizing the Companys exposure to raw material commodity price or foreign currency fluctuation. See Note4.
In instances where transactions are designated as hedges of an underlying item, the gains and losses on those transactions are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) within stockholders equity to the extent they are effective as hedges. The Company has designated certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term borrowings as hedges of the net investment in certain foreign operations. As of December31, 2012, these net investment hedges included British-pound- and Euro-denominated long-term debt, pertaining to certain of its investments in 100% owned subsidiaries whose functional currency is either the British pound or the Euro. As of December31, 2011, these net investment hedges included British-pound-denominated long-term debt, pertaining to certain of its investments in 100% owned subsidiaries whose functional currency is the British pound. These borrowings were designed to create net investment hedges in each of the designated foreign subsidiaries. The Company designated the British-pound- and Euro-denominated loans referred to above as hedging instruments to offset translation gains or losses on the net investment due to changes in the British pound and Euro exchange rates. These net investment hedges were evidenced by managements contemporaneous documentation supporting the hedge designation. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument (the debt) following hedge designation is reported in AOCI in the same manner as the translation adjustment on the investment based on changes in the spot rate, which is used to measure hedge effectiveness. An evaluation of hedge effectiveness is performed by the Company on an ongoing basis and any changes in the hedge are made as appropriate. See Note5.
48 Table of Contents AMETEK, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, under which title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. The Companys policy, with respect to sales returns and allowances, generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances, except at the Companys option. The Company has agreements with distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return for unsold products. The distributor purchases the product from the Company, at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the distributor. The Company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume discounts. The Company accounts for these sales incentives as a reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. Accruals for sales returns, other allowances and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time revenue is recognized based upon past experience. At December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the accrual for future warranty obligations was $27.8million, $22.5million and $18.3million, respectively. The Companys expense for warranty obligations was $10.1million in 2012, $13.2million in 2011 and $10.6million in 2010. The warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the Companys operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses.
Research and Development Company-funded research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $84.9million in 2012, $78.0million in 2011 and $56.8million in 2010.
Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales and were $39.0million in 2012, $35.9million in 2011 and $33.3million in 2010.
Share-Based Compensation The Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic718, CompensationStock Compensation.
Accordingly, the Company expenses the fair value of awards made under its share-based plans. That cost is recognized in the consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period of the grants. See Note11.
Income Taxes The Companys annual provision for income taxes and determination of the related balance sheet accounts requires management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. The Company conducts a broad range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the Companys tax assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to the Companys tax assets and liabilities may be necessary. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.
49 Table of Contents AMETEK, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) The Company also is required to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets, taking into consideration the Companys forecast of future taxable income, the reversal of other existing temporary differences, available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and amount of, valuation allowances against the Companys deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.
Earnings Per Share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares considered outstanding during the periods. The calculation of diluted earnings per share reflects the effect of all potentially dilutive securities (principally outstanding stock options and restricted stock grants). The number of weighted average shares used in the calculation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share was as follows for the years ended December31: 2012 2011 2010 (In thousands) Weighted average shares: Basic shares 241,512 240,383 238,584 Equity-based compensation plans 2,474 2,778 2,742 Diluted shares 243,986 243,161 241,326 2.
Stock Split On May1, 2012, the Companys Board of Directors declared a three-for-two split of the Companys common stock. The stock split resulted in the issuance of one additional share for every two shares owned. The stock split was paid on June29, 2012, to stockholders of record at the close of business on June15, 2012. Additionally, the Board of Directors approved a 50% increase in the quarterly cash dividend rate on the Companys common stock to $0.06per common share from $0.04per common share on a post-split basis. All share and per share information included in this report has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the stock split.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (ASU2011-04). ASU2011-04 amendments result in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between U.S.GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). ASU2011-04 was effective on January1, 2012 for the Company and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No.2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU2011-05). ASU2011-05 requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of 50 Table of Contents AMETEK, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) other comprehensive income and the total of comprehensive income. For interim periods, issuers are only required to provide a total of comprehensive income. These amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income. The Company adopted ASU2011-05 effective January1, 2012. See the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No.2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment (ASU2011-08). The amendments in ASU2011-08 permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic350, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other . ASU2011-08 was effective on January1, 2012 for the Company and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU No.2012-02, Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment (ASU2012-02). The amendments in ASU2012-02, similar to the amendments of ASU2011-08, permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test described in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic350, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other . ASU2012-02 is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September15, 2012. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU2012-02 to have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Fair Value Measurement Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
The Company utilizes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to the valuations used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows. Level1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Companys own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset or liabilitys classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The following table provides the Companys assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December31, 2012 and 2011, consistent with the fair value hierarchy: Asset (Liability) December31, 2012 December31, 2011 FairValue Level 1 Level2 FairValue Level 1 Level 2 (In thousands) Marketable securities $  $  $  $ 4,563 $ 123 $ 4,440 Fixed-income investments 8,316 8,316  2,811 2,811  51 Table of Contents AMETEK, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) The fair value of level 1 marketable securities was based on quoted market prices. The Company held marketable securities in an institutional diversified equity securities mutual fund, which is valued as a level2 investment. Fair value of the institutional diversified equity securities mutual fund was estimated using the net asset value of the Companys ownership interests in the funds capital. The mutual fund seeks to provide long-term growth of capital by investing primarily in equity securities traded on U.S. exchanges and issued by large, established companies across many business sectors. There were no restrictions on the Companys ability to redeem these equity securities investments, which were liquidated in 2012. The marketable securities are shown as a component of other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
The fair value of fixed-income investments was based on quoted market prices, which are valued as level1 investments. The fixed-income investments are shown as a component of long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
For the year ended December31, 2012, gains and losses on the investments noted above were not significant. No transfers between level1 and level2 investments occurred during the year ended December31, 2012.
Financial Instruments Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and fixed-income investments are recorded at fair value at December31, 2012 and 2011 in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
The following table provides the estimated fair values of the Companys financial instruments, for which fair value is measured for disclosure purposes only, compared to the recorded amounts at December31, 2012 and 2011: Asset (Liability) December31, 2012 December31, 2011 RecordedAmount Fair Value RecordedAmount Fair Value (In thousands) Short-term borrowings $ (313,473 ) $ (313,473 ) $ (135,892 ) $ (135,892 ) Long-term debt (including current portion) (1,140,302 ) (1,341,886 ) (1,128,032 ) (1,298,503 ) The fair value of short-term borrowings approximates the carrying value. Short-term borrowings are valued as level2 investments as they are corroborated by observable market data. The Companys long-term debt is all privately held with no public market for this debt, therefore, the fair value of long-term debt was computed based on comparable current market data for similar debt instruments and are considered level3 investments. See Note10 for long-term debt principals, interest rates and maturities.
Forward Contracts At December31, 2012, the Company had a 9.9million Euro forward contract ($46thousand fair value unrealized loss at December31, 2012) outstanding. For the year ended December31, 2012, realized losses on foreign currency forward contracts were $2.1 million. For the year ended December31, 2012, unrealized losses on forward contracts were not significant. The Company has not designated its foreign currency forward contracts as hedges. No forward contracts were outstanding at December31, 2011.

Hedging Activities The Company has designated certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term borrowings as hedges of the net investment in certain foreign operations. As of December31, 2012, these net investment hedges included British-pound- and Euro-denominated long-term debt. As of December31, 2011, these net investment hedges included British-pound-denominated long-term debt. These borrowings were designed to create net investment hedges in each of the designated foreign subsidiaries. The Company designated the British-pound- and Euro-denominated loans referred to above as hedging instruments to offset translation gains or losses on the net investment due to changes in the British pound and Euro exchange rates. These net investment hedges were evidenced by managements contemporaneous documentation supporting the hedge designation. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument (the debt) following hedge designation is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in the same manner as the translation adjustment on the investment based on changes in the spot rate, which is used to measure hedge effectiveness.
At December31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had $195.0million and $186.5million, respectively, of British-pound-denominated loans, which were designated as a hedge against the net investment in British pound functional currency foreign subsidiaries. At December31, 2012, the Company had a $66.0million Euro-denominated loan, which was designated as a hedge against the net investment in Euro functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As a result of these British-pound- and Euro-denominated loans being designated and 100% effective as net investment hedges, $8.3million of currency remeasurement losses and $0.7million of currency remeasurement gains have been included in the foreign currency translation component of other comprehensive income at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) At December31, 2012 and 2011, there has been no provision for U.S.deferred income taxes for the undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which total approximately $665.5million and $410.3million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, because the Company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the United States. Upon distribution of those earnings to the United States, the Company would be subject to U.S.income taxes and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.
At December31, 2012, the Company had tax benefits of $8.2million related to net operating loss carryforwards, which will be available to offset future income taxes payable, subject to certain annual or other limitations based on foreign and U.S. tax laws. This amount includes net operating loss carryforwards of $2.7million for federal income tax purposes with no valuation allowance, $3.4million for state income tax purposes with no valuation allowance and $2.1million for foreign income tax purposes with a valuation allowance of $0.2million. These net operating loss carryforwards, if not used, will expire between 2013 and 2033. As of December31, 2012, the Company had $0.2million of U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards.
The Company maintains a valuation allowance to reduce certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets established for state tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards. In 2012, the Company recorded an increase of $0.6million in the valuation allowance primarily related to excess capital losses from a recent acquisition that are not expected to be utilized.
At December31, 2012, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $36.2million, of which $33.6million, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. At December31, 2011, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $28.5million, of which $25.9million, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate.
At December31, 2012 and 2011, the Company reported $8.2million and $7.2million, respectively, related to interest and penalty exposure as accrued income tax expense in the consolidated balance sheet. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company recognized expense of $1.0million, $1.1million and $1.9million, respectively, for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the consolidated statement of income as a component of income tax expense.
The most significant tax jurisdiction for the Company is the United States. The Company files income tax returns in various state and foreign tax jurisdictions, in some cases for multiple legal entities per jurisdiction. Generally, the Company has open tax years subject to tax audit on average of between three and sixyears in these jurisdictions. At December31, 2012, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has been and is continuing to examine the Companys U.S. income tax returns for the years 2006 through 2009. The IRS previously completed the examination of the Companys U.S. income tax returns for the years 2006 and 2007, however, the periods were reopened by the Company for a limited scope examination of the R&D credit. The Company has not materially extended any other statutes of limitation for any significant location and has reviewed and accrued for, where necessary, tax liabilities for open periods including state and foreign jurisdictions that remain subject to examination. There have been no penalties asserted or imposed by the IRS related to substantial understatement of income, gross valuation misstatement or failure to disclose a listed or reportable transaction.
During 2012, the Company added $11.5million of tax, interest and penalties for identified uncertain tax positions and reversed $2.9million of tax and interest related to statute expirations and settlement of prior uncertain positions. During 2011, the Company added $9.6million of tax, interest and penalties related for identified uncertain tax positions and reversed $2.9million of tax and interest related to statute expirations and settlement of prior uncertain positions.

At December31, 2012, tax, interest and penalties of $34.9million were classified as a noncurrent liability. The net increase in uncertain tax positions for the year ended December31, 2012 resulted in an increase to income tax expense of $8.9million. At December31, 2012, the Company classified $9.5million of tax, interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a current liability as it is reasonably possible that certain tax audits and tax rulings will be substantially settled within the next 12 months.

Share-Based Compensation Under the terms of the Companys stockholder-approved share-based plans, incentive and non-qualified stock options and restricted stock have been, and may be, issued to the Companys officers, management-level employees and members of its Board of Directors. Employee and non-employee director stock options generally vest at a rate of 25%per year, beginning oneyear from the date of the grant, and restricted stock generally has a four-year cliff vesting. Stock options generally have a maximum contractual term of sevenyears. At December31, 2012, 20.1million shares of Company common stock were reserved for issuance under the Companys share-based plans, including 6.8million shares for stock options outstanding.
The Company issues previously unissued shares when stock options are exercised and shares are issued from treasury stock upon the award of restricted stock.
The Company measures and records compensation expense related to all stock awards by recognizing the grant date fair value of the awards over their requisite service periods in the financial statements. For grants under any of the Companys plans that are subject to graded vesting over a service period, the Company recognizes expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.
The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes-Merton model to estimate the fair values of options granted during the years indicated: 2012 2011 2010 Expected volatility 28.4 % 26.4 % 25.6 % Expected term (years) 5.1 5.0 5.0 Risk-free interest rate 0.84 % 1.96 % 2.48 % Expected dividend yield 0.47 % 0.54 % 0.54 % Black-Scholes-Merton fair value per stock option granted $ 8.54 $ 7.56 $ 5.04 Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock. The Company used historical exercise data to estimate the stock options expected term, which represents the period of time that the stock options granted are expected to be outstanding. Management anticipates that the future stock option holding periods will be similar to the historical stock option holding periods. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time of grant. Compensation expense recognized for all share-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The Companys estimated forfeiture rates are based on its historical experience.
Total share-based compensation expense was as follows for the years ended December31: 2012 2011 2010 (In thousands) Stock option expense $ 9,437 $ 8,027 $ 7,580 Restricted stock expense 9,947 14,120 9,016 Total pre-tax expense 19,384 22,147 16,596 Related tax benefit (6,518 ) (7,083 ) (5,459 ) Reduction of net income $ 12,866 $ 15,064 $ 11,137 63 Table of Contents AMETEK, Inc.

The fair value of restricted shares under the Companys restricted stock arrangement is determined by the product of the number of shares granted and the grant date market price of the Companys common stock. Upon the grant of restricted stock, the fair value of the restricted shares (unearned compensation) at the date of grant is charged as a reduction of capital in excess of par value in the Companys consolidated balance sheet and is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is the same as the calculated derived service period as determined on the grant date.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) 12. Retirement Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits Retirement and Pension Plans The Company sponsors several retirement and pension plans covering eligible salaried and hourly employees. The plans generally provide benefits based on participants years of service and/or compensation. The following is a brief description of the Companys retirement and pension plans.
The Company maintains contributory and noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. Benefits for eligible salaried and hourly employees under all defined benefit plans are funded through trusts established in conjunction with the plans. The Companys funding policy with respect to its defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts that provide for benefits based on actuarial calculations and the applicable requirements of U.S. federal and local foreign laws. The Company estimates that it will make both required and discretionary cash contributions of approximately $2million to $5million to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans in 2013.
The Company uses a measurement date of December31 (its fiscal year end) for its U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension plans.
The Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement and savings plan for eligible U.S. employees. Participants in the retirement and savings plan may contribute a specified portion of their compensation on a pre-tax basis, which vary by location. The Company matches employee contributions ranging from 20% to 100%, up to a maximum percentage ranging from 1% to 8% of eligible compensation or up to a maximum of $1,200 per participant in some locations.
The Companys retirement and savings plan has a defined contribution retirement feature principally to cover U.S. salaried employees joining the Company after December31, 1996. Under the retirement feature, the Company makes contributions for eligible employees based on a pre-established percentage of the covered employees salary subject to pre-established vesting. Employees of certain of the Companys foreign operations participate in various local defined contribution plans.
The Company has nonqualified unfunded retirement plans for its Directors and certain retired employees. It also provides supplemental retirement benefits, through contractual arrangements and/or a SERP covering certain current and former executives of the Company. These supplemental benefits are designed to compensate the executive for retirement benefits that would have been provided under the Companys primary retirement plan, except for statutory limitations on compensation that must be taken into account under those plans. The projected benefit obligations of the SERP and the contracts will primarily be funded by a grant of shares of the Companys common stock upon retirement or termination of the executive. The Company is providing for these obligations by charges to earnings over the applicable periods.

The objectives of the AMETEK, Inc. U.S. defined benefit plans investment strategy are to maximize the plans funded status and minimize Company contributions and plan expense. Because the goal is to optimize returns over the long term, an investment policy that favors equity holdings has been established. Since there may be periods of time where both equity and fixed-income markets provide poor returns, an allocation to alternative assets may be made to improve the overall portfolios diversification and return potential. The Company periodically reviews its asset allocation, taking into consideration plan liabilities, plan benefit payment streams and the investment strategy of the pension plans. The actual asset allocation is monitored frequently relative to the established targets and ranges and is rebalanced when necessary. The target allocations for the U.S. defined benefits plans are approximately 45%equity securities, 15%fixed-income securities and 40%other securities and/or cash.
The equity portfolio is diversified by market capitalization and style. The equity portfolio also includes an international component.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) The objective of the fixed-income portion of the pension assets is to provide interest rate sensitivity for a portion of the assets and to provide diversification.

Other than for investments in alternative assets, described in the footnote to the table above, certain investments are prohibited. Prohibited investments include venture capital, private placements, unregistered or restricted stock, margin trading, commodities, short selling and rights and warrants.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) The objective of AMETEK, Inc.s foreign defined benefit plans investment strategy is to maximize the long-term rate of return on plan investments, subject to a reasonable level of risk. Liability studies are also performed on a regular basis to provide guidance in setting investment goals with an objective to balance risks against the current and future needs of the plans. The trustees consider the risk associated with the different asset classes, relative to the plans liabilities and how this can be affected by diversification, and the relative returns available on equities, fixed-income investments, real estate and cash. Also, the likely volatility of those returns and the cash flow requirements of the plans are considered. It is expected that equities will outperform fixed-income investments over the long term. However, the trustees recognize the fact that fixed-income investments may better match the liabilities for pensioners. Because of the relatively young active employee group covered by the plans and the immature nature of the plans, the trustees have chosen to adopt an asset allocation strategy more heavily weighted toward equity investments. This asset allocation strategy will be reviewed, from time to time, in view of changes in market conditions and in the plans liability profile. The target allocations for the foreign defined benefit plans are approximately 68%equity securities, 16%fixed-income securities and 16%other securities, insurance or cash.
The assumption for the expected return on plan assets was developed based on a review of historical investment returns for the investment categories for the defined benefit pension assets. This review also considered current capital market conditions and projected future investment returns. The estimates of future capital market returns by asset class are lower than the actual long-term historical returns. The current low interest rate environment influences this outlook. Therefore, the assumed rate of return for U.S. plans is 7.75% and 6.91% for foreign plans in 2013.

Future benefit payments primarily represent amounts to be paid from pension trust assets. Amounts included that are to be paid from the Companys assets are not significant in any individual year.
Postretirement Plans and Postemployment Benefits The Company provides limited postretirement benefits other than pensions for certain retirees and a small number of former employees. Benefits under these arrangements are not funded and are not significant.
The Company also provides limited postemployment benefits for certain former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement. Those benefits are not significant in amount.
The Company has a deferred compensation plan, which allows employees whose compensation exceeds the statutory IRS limit for retirement benefits to defer a portion of earned bonus compensation. The plan permits deferred amounts to be deemed invested in either, or a combination of, (a)an interest-bearing account, benefits from which are payable out of the general assets of the Company, or (b)the equivalent of a fund which invests in shares of the Companys common stock on behalf of the employee. The amount deferred under the plan, including income earned, was $20.6million and $19.5million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Administrative expense for the deferred compensation plan is borne by the Company and is not significant.
13.
Guarantees The Company does not provide significant guarantees on a routine basis. The Company primarily issues guarantees, stand-by letters of credit and surety bonds in the ordinary course of its business to provide financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries to support or enhance the subsidiarys stand-alone creditworthiness. The amounts subject to certain of these agreements vary depending on the covered contracts actually outstanding at any particular point in time. At December31, 2012, the maximum amount of future payment obligations relative to these various guarantees was $75.5million and the outstanding liability under certain of those guarantees was $6.2million.
Indemnifications In conjunction with certain acquisition and divestiture transactions, the Company may agree to make payments to compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified events (e.g., breaches of contract obligations or retention of previously existing environmental, tax or employee liabilities) whose terms range in duration and often are not explicitly defined. Where appropriate, the obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Because the amount of these types of indemnifications generally is not specifically stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Further, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers for claims against them in connection with their positions with the Company. Historically, any such costs incurred to settle claims related to these indemnifications have been minimal for the Company. The Company believes that future payments, if any, under all existing indemnification agreements would not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Product Warranties The Company provides limited warranties in connection with the sale of its products. The warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the Companys operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses.
Changes in the accrued product warranty obligation were as follows at December31: 2012 2011 2010 (In thousands) Balance at the beginning of the year $ 22,466 $ 18,347 $ 16,035 Accruals for warranties issued during the year 10,089 13,247 10,616 Settlements made during the year (10,602 ) (10,175 ) (9,691 ) Changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations during the year   (262 ) Warranty accruals related to acquired businesses and other during the year 5,839 1,047 1,649 Balance at the end of the year $ 27,792 $ 22,466 $ 18,347 Certain settlements of warranties made during the period were for specific nonrecurring warranty obligations. Product warranty obligations are reported as current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
14.
Contingencies Asbestos Litigation The Company (including its subsidiaries) has been named as a defendant, along with many other companies, in a number of asbestos-related lawsuits. Many of these lawsuits either relate to businesses which were acquired by the Company and do not involve products which were manufactured or sold by the Company or relate to previously owned businesses of the Company which are under new ownership. In connection with many of these lawsuits, the sellers or new owners of such businesses, as the case may be, have agreed to indemnify the Company against these claims (the Indemnified Claims). The Indemnified Claims have been tendered to, and are being defended by, such sellers and new owners. These sellers and new owners have met their obligations, in all respects, and the Company does not have any reason to believe such parties would fail to fulfill their obligations in the future; however, one of these companies filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007. To date, no judgments have been rendered against the Company as a result of any asbestos-related lawsuit. The Company believes it has strong defenses to the claims being asserted and intends to continue to vigorously defend itself in these matters.
Environmental Matters Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations. At December31, 2012, the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at 14 non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the non-owned sites). The Company is identified as a de minimis party in 13 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In nine of 76 Table of Contents AMETEK, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) these sites, the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the deminimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount. At the remaining site where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the Companys expected obligations. The Company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations (the owned sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements. In estimating the Companys liability for remediation, the Company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.
Total environmental reserves at December31, 2012 and 2011 were $23.6million and $28.0million, respectively, for both non-owned and owned sites. In 2012, the Company recorded $0.7million in reserves. Additionally, the Company spent $5.1million on environmental matters in 2012. The Companys reserves for environmental liabilities at December31, 2012 and 2011 include reserves of $14.7million and $17.5million, respectively, for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of HCC Industries (HCC). The Company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a Superfund site in the SanGabriel Valley of California. The Company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required remedial activities. At December31, 2012, the Company had $11.3million in receivables related to HCC for probable recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed third-party funds to support the required remediation. Also, the Company is indemnified by HCCs former owners for approximately $19.0million of additional costs.
The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in all material respects.
The Company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. The Company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.

Leases and Other Commitments Minimum aggregate rental commitments under noncancellable leases in effect at December31, 2012 (principally for production and administrative facilities and equipment) amounted to $165.9million, consisting of payments of $31.4million in 2013, $25.9million in 2014, $21.2million in 2015, $17.4million in 2016, $12.3million in 2017 and $57.7million thereafter. The leases expire over a range of years from 2013 to 2082, with renewal or purchase options, subject to various terms and conditions, contained in most of the leases. Rental expense was $28.0million in 2012, $26.4million in 2011 and $23.1million in 2010.
As of December31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had $325.6million and $275.5million, respectively, in purchase obligations outstanding, which primarily consisted of contractual commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed prices.
