Company History Actavis plc (formerly known as Actavis Limited) was incorporated in Ireland on May16, 2013 as a private limited company and re-registered effective September18, 2013 as a public limited company. It was established for the purpose of facilitating the business combination between Actavis, Inc. and Warner Chilcott plc (Warner Chilcott). On October1, 2013, pursuant to the transaction agreement dated May19, 2013 among Actavis, Inc., Warner Chilcott, the Company, Actavis Ireland Holding Limited, Actavis W.C. Holding LLC (now known as Actavis W.C. Holding Inc.) and Actavis W.C. Holding 2 LLC (now known as Actavis W.C. Holding 2 Inc.) (MergerSub), (i)the Company acquired Warner Chilcott (the Warner Chilcott Acquisition) pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under Section201, and a capital reduction under Sections 72 and 74, of the Irish Companies Act of 1963 where each Warner Chilcott ordinary share was converted into 0.160 of an Actavis plc ordinary share (the Company Ordinary Shares), or $5,833.9 million in equity consideration, and (ii)MergerSub merged with and into Actavis, Inc., with Actavis, Inc. as the surviving corporation in the merger (the Merger and, together with the Warner Chilcott Acquisition, the Transactions). Following the consummation of the Transactions, Actavis, Inc. and Warner Chilcott became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Actavis plc. Each of Actavis, Inc.s common shares was converted into one Company Ordinary Share. Effective October1, 2013, through a series of related-party transactions, Actavis plc contributed its indirect subsidiaries, including Actavis, Inc. to Warner Chilcott Limited.
On October31, 2012, Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. completed the acquisition of the Actavis Group for a cash payment of 4.2 billion, or approximately $5.5 billion, and contingent consideration of 5.5million newly issued shares of Actavis, Inc., which have since been issued (the Actavis Group Acquisition). Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s Common Stock was traded on the NYSE under the symbol WPI until close of trading on January23, 2013, at which time Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. changed its corporate name to Actavis, Inc. and changed its ticker symbol to ACT.
References throughout to we, our, us, the Company or Actavis refer to financial information and transactions of Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. prior to January23, 2013, Actavis, Inc. from January23, 2013 until October1, 2013 and Actavis plc and Warner Chilcott Limited subsequent to October1, 2013.
References throughout to Ordinary Shares refer to Actavis, Inc.s ClassA common shares, par value $0.0033 per share, prior to the consummation of the Transactions and to Actavis plcs ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, since the consummation of the Transactions.
Pursuant to Rule 12g-3(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), Actavis plc is the successor issuer to Actavis, Inc. and to Warner Chilcott. Actavis plcs ordinary shares are deemed to be registered under Section12(b) of the Exchange Act, and Actavis plc is subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

On November17, 2014, Actavis plc and Allergan, Inc. (Allergan) announced that they entered into a definitive agreement under which Actavis plc will acquire Allergan for a combination of $129.22 in cash and 0.3683 of a Company Ordinary Share for each share of Allergan common stock (the Pending Allergan Acquisition). Based on the closing price of Actavis ordinary shares on November14, 2014, the transaction was valued at approximately $66.0 billion. The addition of Allergans therapeutic franchises in ophthalmology, neurosciences and medical aesthetics/dermatology/plastic surgery will complement Actavis existing central nervous system, gastroenterology, womens health and urology franchises. The combined company will also 1 Table of Contents benefit significantly from Allergans global brand equity and consumer awareness of key products, including Botox  and Restasis  . The transaction also expands our presence, market and product reach across many international markets, with strengthened commercial positions across Canada, Europe, Southeast Asia and other high-value growth markets, including China, India, the Middle East and Latin America. The transaction is expected to close late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2015.

At June30, 2014, after an identified triggering event, the acquired IPR&D intangible asset related to Colvir, a treatment of premalignant Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) lesions of the uterine, of $2.0 million was deemed to be fully impaired. Consequently the $1.5 million contingent liability was also written off, resulting in a net loss of $0.5 million.
2012 and Prior Significant Business Developments During 2012 and prior, we completed and / or initiated the following transactions that impacted our results of operations and will continue to have an impact on our future operations.
Acquisition of Actavis Group On October31, 2012, we completed the Actavis Group Acquisition. The Actavis Group was a privately held generic pharmaceutical company specializing in the development, manufacture and sale of generic pharmaceuticals. Actavis plcs consolidated financial statements included in this report do not include the financial results of the Actavis Group for any of the periods or at any of the dates presented prior to November1, 2012. We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination requiring that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.
Rugby OTC Business On October29, 2012, we sold our Rugby Group, Inc. (Rugby) OTC pharmaceutical products and trademarks to The Harvard Drug Group, L.L.C. (Harvard) for $116.6 million (the Rugby Sale). Under the terms of the agreement, Harvard acquired the Rugby trademark and all rights to market, sell and distribute OTC products and nicotine gum products sold under the trademark. We retained all rights to manufacture, sell and distribute all store-branded OTC and nicotine gum products, as well as other non-Rugby OTC products in our portfolio. We retained ownership of our nicotine gum ANDAs, as well as nicotine gum manufacturing facilities. Also, as part of the transaction, we entered into a supply and license agreement with Harvard under which we manufacture and supply nicotine gum products sold under the Rugby and Major labels. Major is Harvards existing private label brand.
7 Table of Contents Sale of Moksha8 Ownership On October22, 2012, we sold our investment in Moksha8 Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Moksha8) for $46.6 million (the Moksha8 Sale). Simultaneously, we expanded our ongoing sales and marketing collaboration with Moksha8 by granting a license to Moksha8 for five new branded generic products to be developed for the Brazilian and Mexican markets in exchange for defined milestones and sales royalties. We retained generic marketing rights in each market for all products licensed to Moksha8. As a result of the sale, the Company recorded a gain of $28.8 million in other income (expense) in the year ended December31, 2012. During the year ended December31, 2013, the Company terminated the agreement with Moksha8 resulting in a loss of $4.0 million. As part of the Forest Acquisition, the Company acquired Forests agreement with Moksha8. Refer to Note 6  Collaborations in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this document for more information.
Amgen Collaboration In December 2011, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Amgen Inc. (Amgen) to develop and commercialize, on a worldwide basis, biosimilar versions of Herceptin  , Avastin  , Rituxan/Mab Thera  , and Erbitux  (the Amgen Collaboration Agreement). Amgen has assumed primary responsibility for developing, manufacturing and initially commercializing the oncology antibody products. As of December31, 2014, the Companys maximum future contributions were up to $254.8 million in remaining co-development costs over the remaining course of development, including the provision of development support, and the Company will share product development risks. In addition, we will contribute our significant expertise in the commercialization and marketing of products in highly competitive specialty and generic markets, including helping effectively manage the lifecycle of the biosimilar products. The collaboration products are expected to be sold under a joint Amgen/Actavis label. We will initially receive royalties and sales milestones from product revenues. The collaboration will not pursue biosimilars of Amgens proprietary products.
Business Description Prescription pharmaceutical products in the U.S.generally are marketed as either generic or brand pharmaceuticals. Generic pharmaceutical products are bioequivalents of, or in cases of protein-based biologic therapies, biosimilar to, their respective brand products, and provide a cost-efficient alternative to brand products. Brand pharmaceutical products are marketed under brand names through programs that are designed to generate physician and consumer loyalty. Through our Anda Distribution segment, we distribute pharmaceutical products, primarily generics, which have been commercialized by us and others, to independent pharmacies, pharmacy chains, pharmacy buying groups and physicians offices.
As a result of the differences between the types of products we market and/or distribute and the methods by which we distribute these products, we operate and manage our business in three distinct operating segments: North American Brands, North American Generics and International and Anda Distribution. The North American Brands segment includes patent-protected and off-patent products that the Company sells and markets as brand pharmaceutical products within North America. The North American Generics and International segment includes certain trademarked off-patent products that the Company sells and markets as off-patent pharmaceutical products that are therapeutically equivalent to proprietary products within North America. Also included in this segment are international revenues that include patent-protected and off-patent products that the Company sells and markets as brand pharmaceutical products, certain trademarked off-patent products that the Company sells and markets as off-patent pharmaceutical products that are therapeutically equivalent to proprietary products, over the counter products and revenues from our third party Medis business. The Anda Distribution segment distributes generic and brand pharmaceutical products manufactured by third parties, as well as by the Company, primarily to independent pharmacies, pharmacy chains, pharmacy buying groups and physicians offices. The Anda Distribution segment operating results exclude sales of products developed, acquired, or licensed by the North American Brands and North American Generics and International segments.
8 Table of Contents Business Strategy We apply three key strategies to achieve growth for our North American Brands and North American Generics and International businesses: (i)internal development of differentiated and high-demand products, including, in certain circumstances as it relates to generics, challenging patents associated with these products, (ii)establishment of strategic alliances and collaborations and (iii)acquisition of products and companies that complement our current business. The Company also develops and out licenses generic pharmaceutical products through its Medis third party business. Our Anda Distribution business distributes products for approximately 340 suppliers and is focused on providing next-day delivery and responsive service to its customers. Our Anda Distribution business distributes a number of generic and brand products in the U.S. Growth in our Anda Distribution business will be largely dependent upon customer expansion, FDA approval of new generic products in the U.S. and expansion of our base of suppliers.
Based upon business conditions, our financial strength and other factors, we regularly reexamine our business strategies and may change them at any time. Refer to ITEM1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business in this document.
North American Brands Segment Newly developed pharmaceutical products normally are patented or have market exclusivity and, as a result, are generally offered by a single provider when first introduced to the market. We market a number of branded products to physicians, hospitals, and other markets that we serve. These patented and off-patent trademarked products are brand pharmaceutical products. In November 2014, as a result of the Durata Acquisition, we began promoting Dalvance  . In July 2014, as a result of the Forest Acquisition, we began promoting a number of additional brand products including, but not limited to Bystolic  , Canasa  , Carafate  , Daliresp  , Fetzima  , Linzess  , Namenda  , Namenda XR  , Saphris  , Teflaro  and Viibryd  . In October 2013, as a result of the Warner Chilcott Acquisition, we began promoting a number of additional brand products, including, but not limited to, Actonel  , Asacol  HD, Atelvia  , Delzicol  , Doryx  , Estrace  Cream, Enablex  , Lo Loestrin  Fe and Minastrin  24 Fe.
Net revenues in our North American Brands segment were $4,631.4 million, $1,062.5 million, and $478.2 million, or approximately 35.5%, 12.2% and 8.1% of our total net revenues in the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Typically, our brand products realize higher profit margins than our generic products.
North American Brands Strategy Our North American Brands business is focused on maintaining a leading position within North America, and in particular, the U.S.market.
We market our brand products through our active sales professionals in North America. Our sales and marketing efforts focus on general and specialty physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of particular medical conditions. Each group offers products to satisfy the unique needs of these physicians. We believe this focused sales and marketing approach enables us to foster close professional relationships with specialty physicians, as well as cover the primary care physicians who also prescribe in selected therapeutic areas. We believe that the current structure of sales professionals is very adaptable to the additional products we plan to add to our brand portfolio.
We have maintained an ongoing effort to enhance efficiencies and reduce costs in our manufacturing operations.
9 Table of Contents North American Brand Product Portfolio As of December31, 2014, our portfolio of approximately 80 brand pharmaceutical product families includes the following key promoted products: ActavisBrandProduct Active Ingredient Therapeutic Classification Actonel  Risedronate Osteoporosis Androderm  Testosterone (transdermal patch) Male testosterone replacement Asacol  HD Mesalamine Ulcerative Colitis Atelvia  Risedronate Osteoporosis Bystolic  Nebivolol Hypertension Canasa  Mesalamine USP Ulcerative proctitis Carafte  Solifenacin succinate Anti-ulcer Crinone  Progesterone Progesterone supplementation Dalvance  Dalbavancin Antibacterial - ABSSSI *Daliresp  Roflumilast ChronicObstructivePulmonaryDisease Delzicol  Mesalamine Ulcerative Colitis *Doryx  Doxycycline hyclate Acne Enablex  Darifenacin Overactive bladder Estrace  Cream Estradiol Hormone Therapy Fetzima  Levomilnacipran Major depressive disorders Generess  Fe Ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone Oral contraceptive INFeD  Iron dextran Hematinic Kadian  Morphine sulfate Opioid analgesic Linzess  Linaclotide Irritable bowel syndrome Lo Loestrin  Fe Ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone Oral contraceptive Minastrin  24 Fe Ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone Oral contraceptive Namendafranchise Memantine HCl Dementia Oxytrol  Oxybutnin (transdermal patch) Overactive bladder Rapaflo  Silodosin Benign prostatic hyperplasia Saphris  Asenapine Schizophrenia Savella  Milnacipran HCl Fibromyalgia Teflaro  Ceftaroline fosamil Bacterial pneumonia Trelstar  Triptorelin pamoate injection Prostate cancer *Tudorza  Aclidinium bromide Bronchospasm Viibryd  Vilazodone HCl Major depressive disorders Zenpep  Pancrelipase Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency * The Company recently entered into agreements to divest these products.
North American Generics and International Segment Actavis is a leader in the development, manufacturing and sale of generic, branded generic and OTC pharmaceutical products. In certain cases where patents or other regulatory exclusivity no longer protect a brand product, or other opportunities might exist, Actavis seeks to introduce generic counterparts to the brand product. These generic products are bioequivalent to their brand name counterparts and are generally sold at significantly lower prices than the brand product. Our portfolio of generic products includes products we have developed internally and products licensed from and distributed for third parties. Also included in this segment are international revenues, which include patent-protected and off-patent products that the Company sells and markets as brand pharmaceutical products, certain trademarked off-patent products that the Company sells and 10 Table of Contents markets as off-patent pharmaceutical products that are therapeutically equivalent to proprietary products, over the counter products and revenues from our third party Medis business. Within the Companys North American Generics and International reporting segment, the United States is the largest contributing market.
Net revenues in our North American Generics and International segment accounted for $6,747.2 million, $6,418.2 million, and $4,450.3 million, or approximately 51.7%, 74.0%, and 75.2% of our total net revenues in the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Within this segment approximately 61.9%, 61.0%, and 78.0% of 2014, 2013 and 2012 segment net revenue came from our North Americangenerics, respectively.
North American Generics and International Strategy Our North American Generics and International business is focused on maintaining a leading position within both the North American, and in particular, the U.S.market and our key international markets and strengthening our global position by offering a consistent and reliable supply of quality brand and generic products.
Our strategy in the U.S. is to develop pharmaceuticals that are difficult to formulate or manufacture or will complement or broaden our existing product lines. Internationally, we seek to grow our market share in key markets while expanding our presence in new markets. We plan to accomplish this through new product launches, filing existing products overseas and in-licensing products through acquisitions and strategic alliances.
We have maintained an ongoing effort to enhance efficiencies and reduce costs in our manufacturing operations.
Generic Product Portfolio As of December31, 2014, our U.S. portfolio of approximately 250 generic pharmaceutical product families includes the following key products which comprised a majority of product sales for North American Generics for the year-ended December31, 2014: Actavis Generic Product Comparable Brand Name Therapeutic Classification Amethia  Seasonique  Oral contraceptive Bupropion hydrochloride ER Wellbutrin XL  Anti-depressant Buprenorphine HCI, Naloxone HCI Suboxone  Anti-depressant Celecoxib Celebrex  Anti-inflammatory Desonide lotion and cream Desowen  Dermatology Doxycycline hyclate Vibramycin  Antibiotic Dronabinol Marinol  Antiemetic Duloxetine HCI Cymbalta  Anti-depressant Enoxaparin sodium Lovenox  Anticoagulant Fentanyl transdermal system Duragesic  Analgesic/narcotic combination Glipizide ER Glucotrol XL  Anti-diabetic Guanfacine ER Intuniv  Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder Hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen Lorcet  , Lorcet  Plus, Lortab  , Norco  /Anexsia  , Maxidone  , Vicodin  , Vicodin ES  , Vicodin HP  Analgesic Hydromorphone ER Exalgo  Analgesic Lidocaine topical patch 5% Lidoderm  Anesthetic 11 Table of Contents Actavis Generic Product Comparable Brand Name Therapeutic Classification Methylphenidate ER Concerta  Hypertension, attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder Metoprolol succinate Toprol XL  Anti-hypertensive Microgestin  /Microgestin  Fe Loestrin  /Loestrin  Fe Oral contraceptive Mixed Amphetamine Salts ER Adderall XR  CII Hypertension, attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder Morphine sulfate Avinza  , Kadian  Analgesic Next Choice One Dose TM Plan B One-Step  Emergency oral contraceptive Potassium Micro-K  , K-Dur  Hypokalemia Permethrin Elimite Dermatology Risedronate Actonel Osteoporosis Ursodiol Actigall  Bile stone therapy In the U.S., we predominantly market our generic products to various drug wholesalers, mail order, government and national retail drug and food store chains utilizing a small team of sales and marketing professionals. During 2014, on a combined business, we expanded our generic product line with the launch of approximately 550 generic products globally.
Operations in Key International Markets Approximately 38.1%, 39.0% and 22.0% of our North American Generics and International revenue was derived outside of North America in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
Research and Development We devote significant resources to the R&D of brand products, generic products, biosimilars and proprietary drug delivery technologies. R&D activities are expensed as incurred and consist of self-funded R&D costs, the costs associated with work performed under collaborative R&D agreements, regulatory fees, and milestone payments, if any. R&D expenses include the following key components (in millions): Years Ended December31, 2014 2013 2012 Generic expenditures $ 474.9 $ 425.1 $ 255.6 Brand expenditures 512.1 110.7 68.6 Biosimilar expenditures 98.9 81.1 78.3 Total R&D $ 1,085.9 $ 616.9 $ 402.5 We are presently developing a number of products through a combination of internal and collaborative programs.
Our R&D strategy focuses on the following product development areas:  the application of proprietary drug-delivery technology for new product development in specialty areas;  the acquisition of mid-to-late development-stage brand drugs and biosimilars;  off-patent drugs that are difficult to develop or manufacture, or that complement or broaden our existing product lines; and 12 Table of Contents  the development of sustained-release, semi-solid, liquid, oral transmucosal, transdermal, gel, injectable, and other drug delivery technologies and the application of these technologies to proprietary drug forms.
We conduct R&D through a network of more than 20 global R&D centers.As of December31, 2014, we conducted the majority of our R&D activities in Davie and Weston, Florida; Salt Lake City, Utah and Elizabeth, New Jersey.
As of December31, 2014, we had more than 200 ANDAs on file in the U.S. Refer to the Government Regulation and Regulatory Matters section below for a description of our process for obtaining FDA approval for our products. Refer to ITEM1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Relating to Investing in the Pharmaceutical Industry  Extensive industry regulation has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business, especially our product development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities in this document.
As of December31, 2014, we are presently developing a number of brand products, some of which utilize novel drug-delivery systems, through a combination of internal and collaborative programs including the following: Product Therapeutic Area Indication Expected Launch Year Phase Liletta Womenshealthcare IUDforcontraception 2015 Registration Ceftazidime-avibactam Anti-infective Antibiotic for gram negative infections 2015 Registration Cariprazine Centralnervoussystem Bipolar Schizophrenia 2015 Registration Eluxadoline Gastroenterology IBS-D 2016 Registration Esmya Womens healthcare Uterine fibroids 2017 III Sarecycline Dermatology Severe acne 2017 III Travena Cardiovascular Acute heart failure 2018 II Relamorelin Gastroenterology Gastroparesis 2019 II We also have a number of products in development as part of our life-cycle management strategy on our existing product portfolio.
Anda Distribution Segment Our Anda Distribution segment distributes generic and brand pharmaceutical products manufactured by third parties, as well as by Actavis, primarily to independent pharmacies, pharmacy chains, pharmacy buying groups and physicians offices. Sales are principally generated through our national accounts relationships, an in-house telemarketing staff and through internally developed ordering systems. Additionally, we sell to members of buying groups, which are independent pharmacies that join together to enhance their buying power. We believe that we are able to effectively compete in the distribution market, and therefore optimize our market share, based on three critical elements: (i)competitive pricing, (ii)high levels of inventory for approximately 12,650 SKUs for responsive customer service that includes, among other things, next day delivery to the entire U.S., and (iii)well-established telemarketing relationships with our customers, supplemented by our electronic ordering capabilities. While we purchase most of the SKUs in our Anda Distribution operations from third party manufacturers, we also distribute our own products and our collaborative partners products. We are the only U.S.pharmaceutical company that has meaningful distribution operations with direct access to independent pharmacies.
Revenue growth in our distribution operations will in part be dependent on the launch of new products, offset by the overall level of net price and unit declines on existing distributed products, and will be subject to changes in market share.
Financial Information About Segments and Geographic Areas The Company evaluates segment performance based on segment contribution. Segment contribution for North American Brands, North American Generics and International, and Anda Distribution represents segment 13 Table of Contents net revenues less cost of sales (excluding amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles including product rights), selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses. The Company does not evaluate total assets, capital expenditures, R&D expenses, amortization, goodwill impairments, in-process research and development impairments, loss on assets held for sale and asset sales, impairments and contingent consideration adjustment, net by segment as not all such information has been accounted for at the segment level, or such information has not been used by all segments.
Customers In our North American Brands and North American Generics and International operations, we sell our generic and brand pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers, retailers and distributors, including national retail drug and food store chains, hospitals, clinics, mail order retailers, government agencies and managed healthcare providers such as health maintenance organizations and other institutions. In our Anda Distribution business, we distribute generic and brand pharmaceutical products to independent pharmacies, alternate care providers (hospitals, nursing homes and mail order pharmacies), pharmacy chains, physicians offices and buying groups.
Sales to certain of our customers accounted for 10% or more of our annual revenues during the past three years. The following table illustrates any customer, on a global basis, which accounted for 10% or more of our annual revenues in any of the past three fiscal years and the respective percentage of our revenues for which they account for each of the last three years: Customer 2014 2013 2012 AmerisourceBergen Corporation 28 % 8 % 7 % McKesson Corporation 21 % 11 % 14 % Cardinal Healthcare, Inc.
13 % 9 % 9 % Walgreens 1 % 9 % 16 % Our significant customers comprise a large part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in North America.As a result, a small number of large, wholesale distributors and large drug store chains control a significant share of the market. Changes in the mix of concentration amongst the Companys largest customers over the last three years are due, in part, to the impact of acquisitions as well as changes in the supply chain of our indirect customers. This concentration may adversely impact pricing and create other competitive pressures on drug manufacturers. Our Anda Distribution business competes directly with our large wholesaler customers with respect to the distribution of generic products.
The loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Refer to ITEM1A. RISK FACTORS Risk Relating to Investing in the Pharmaceutical Industry  Sales of our products may continue to be adversely affected by the continuing consolidation of our distribution network and the concentration of our customer base. in this document.
Competition The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. In our North American Brands and North American Generics and International businesses, we compete with different companies depending upon product categories, and within each product category, upon dosage strengths and drug delivery systems. Such competitors include the major brand name and generic manufacturers of pharmaceutical products. In addition to product development, other competitive factors in the pharmaceutical industry include product quality, price, reputation, service and access to proprietary and technical information. It is possible that developments by others will make our products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete.
Competing in the brand product business requires us to identify and bring to market new products embodying technological innovations. Successful marketing of brand products depends primarily on the ability to communicate their effectiveness, safety and value to healthcare professionals in private practice, group practices 14 Table of Contents and receive formulary status from managed care organizations. We anticipate that our brand product offerings will support our existing areas of therapeutic focus. Based upon business conditions and other factors, we regularly reevaluate our business strategies and may from time to time reallocate our resources from one therapeutic area to another, withdraw from a therapeutic area or add an additional therapeutic area in order to maximize our overall growth opportunities. Our competitors in brand products include major brand name manufacturers of pharmaceuticals. Many of our competitors have been in business for a longer period of time, have a greater number of products on the market and have greater financial and other resources than we do. If we directly compete with them for certain contracted business, such as the Pharmacy Benefit Manager business, and for the same markets and/or products, their financial strength could prevent us from capturing a meaningful share of those markets.
We actively compete in the generic pharmaceutical industry. Revenues and gross profit derived from the sales of generic pharmaceutical products tend to follow a pattern based on certain regulatory and competitive factors. As patents and regulatory exclusivity for brand name products expire or are successfully challenged, the first off-patent manufacturer to receive regulatory approval for generic equivalents of such products is generally able to achieve significant market penetration. As competing off-patent manufacturers receive regulatory approvals on similar products, market share, revenues and gross profit typically decline, in some cases dramatically. Accordingly, the level of market share, revenues and gross profit attributable to a particular generic product normally is related to the number of competitors in that products market, pricing and the timing of that products regulatory approval and launch, in relation to competing approvals and launches. Consequently, we must continue to develop and introduce new products in a timely and cost-effective manner to maintain our revenues and gross profit. In addition to competition from other generic drug manufacturers, we face competition from brand name companies in the generic market. Many of these companies seek to participate in sales of generic products by, among other things, collaborating with other generic pharmaceutical companies or by marketing their own generic equivalent to their brand products as Authorized Generics. Our major competitors include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., Mylan Inc. and Sandoz, Inc. (a division of Novartis AG). Refer to ITEM1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Investing in the Pharmaceutical Industry  The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and our future revenue growth and profitability are dependent on our timely development and launches of new products ahead of our competitors in this document.
In our Anda Distribution segment, we compete with a number of large wholesalers and other distributors of pharmaceuticals, including McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc., which distribute both brand and generic pharmaceutical products to their customers. These same companies are significant customers of our North American Brand and North American Generics and International businesses. As generic products generally have higher gross margins than brand products for a pharmaceutical distribution business, each of the large wholesalers, on an increasing basis, are offering pricing incentives on brand products if the customers purchase a majority of their generic pharmaceutical products from the primary wholesaler. As we do not offer as broad a portfolio of brand products to our customers as some of our competitors, we are at times competitively disadvantaged. Increased competition in the generic industry as a whole may result in increased price erosion in the pursuit of market share. Refer to ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  Risks Related to Our Business  Our Anda Distribution operations compete directly with significant customers of our generic and brand businesses in this document.
15 Table of Contents Manufacturing, Suppliers and Materials As of December31, 2014, we manufactured many of our own finished products at our plants including major manufacturing sites in: Location State / Country Dupnitsa Bulgaria Davie Florida Weiderstadt Germany Athens Greece Hafnarfjordur Iceland Ambernath India Goa India Dublin Ireland Nerviano Italy Birzebbugia Malta Elizabeth New Jersey Coleraine Northern Ireland Fajardo Puerto Rico Barnstaple UK Salt Lake City Utah We have implemented several cost reduction initiatives, which included the transfer of several solid dosage products from our Corona, California facility to other facilities throughout our manufacturing network and the ongoing implementation of an operational excellence initiative at certain of our manufacturing facilities. Our manufacturing facilities also include additional plants supporting local markets and alternative dosage forms. For a more complete list of manufacturing facilities please refer to ITEM2. PROPERTIES in this document.
We have development and manufacturing capabilities for raw material and active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and intermediate ingredients to support our internal product development efforts in our Coleraine, Northern Ireland and Ambernath, India facilities. Our Ambernath, India facility also manufactures API for third parties.
Our manufacturing operations are subject to extensive regulatory oversight and could be interrupted at any time. Refer to ITEM1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Relating to Investing in the Pharmaceutical Industry  Extensive industry regulation has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business, especially our product development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities. Also refer to Legal Matters in NOTE24 Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this document.
In addition, we are dependent on third parties for the supply of the raw materials necessary to develop and manufacture our products, including the API and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients used in many of our products. We are required to identify the supplier(s) of all the raw materials for our products in the drug applications that we file with the FDA. If raw materials for a particular product become unavailable from an approved supplier specified in a drug application, we would be required to qualify a substitute supplier with the FDA, which would likely interrupt manufacturing of the affected product. To the extent practicable, we attempt to identify more than one supplier in each drug application. However, some raw materials are available only from a single source and, in many of our drug applications, only one supplier of raw materials has been identified, even in instances where multiple sources exist.
Further we obtain a significant portion of our raw materials from foreign suppliers. Arrangements with international raw material suppliers are subject to, among other things, FDA regulation, customs clearance, various import duties, foreign currency risk and other government clearances. Acts of governments outside the U.S.may affect the price or availability of raw materials needed for the development or manufacture of our products. In addition, any changes in patent laws in jurisdictions outside the U.S.may make it increasingly difficult to obtain raw 16 Table of Contents materials for R&D prior to the expiration of the applicable U.S.or foreign patents. Refer to ITEM1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business  If we are unable to obtain sufficient supplies from key manufacturing sites or suppliers that in some cases may be the only source of finished products or raw materials, our ability to deliver our products to the market may be impeded in this document. Refer to ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS  Risks Relating to Investing in the Pharmaceutical Industry  The supply of APIs into Europe may be negatively affected by recent regulations promulgated by the European Union in this document.
Patents and Proprietary Rights We believe patent protection of our proprietary products is important to our North American Brands business as well as certain international products. Our success with our brand products will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain, and successfully defend if challenged, patent or other proprietary protection for such products. We currently have a number of U.S.and foreign patents issued or pending. However, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or as to the enforceable scope of the claims of the patent. Accordingly, our patents may not prevent other companies from developing similar or functionally equivalent products or from successfully challenging the validity of our patents. If our patent applications are not approved or, even if approved, if such patents are circumvented or not upheld in a court of law, or administrative proceedings, including oppositions, re-examinations or inter partes review (IPR), our ability to competitively market our patented products and technologies may be significantly reduced. Also, such patents may or may not provide competitive advantages for their respective products or they may be challenged or circumvented by competitors, in which case our ability to commercially market these products may be diminished. From time to time, we may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to develop, manufacture and market our products. If we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to commercially market such products may be inhibited or prevented. Patents covering our Estrace  Cream, Actonel  (certain indications), Androderm  , Femhrt  , INFed  and Carafate  products have expired and we have no further patent protection on these products.
We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our partners, customers, employees and consultants. It is possible that these agreements will be breached or will not be enforceable in every instance, and we will not have adequate remedies for any such breach. It is also possible that our trade secrets will otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors.
We may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our trade secrets or know-how or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation concerning patents, trademarks, copyrights and proprietary technologies can often be protracted and expensive and, as with litigation generally, the outcome is inherently uncertain.
Pharmaceutical companies with brand products are suing companies that produce off-patent forms of their brand name products for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights which may delay or prevent the entry of such a generic product into the market. For instance, when we file an ANDA in the U.S.seeking approval of a generic equivalent to a brand drug, we may certify under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Restoration Act of 1984 (the Hatch-Waxman Act) to the FDA that we do not intend to market our generic drug until any patent listed by the FDA as covering the brand drug has expired, in which case, the ANDA will be approved by the FDA no earlier than the expiration or final finding of invalidity of such patent(s). On the other hand, we could certify that we believe the patent or patents listed as covering the brand drug are invalid and/or will not be infringed by the manufacture, sale or use of our generic form of the brand drug. In that case, we are required to notify the brand product holder or the patent holder that such patent is invalid or is not infringed. If the patent holder sues us for patent infringement within 45days from receipt of the notice, the FDA is then prevented from approving our ANDA for 30months after receipt of the notice unless the lawsuit is resolved in our favor in less time or a shorter period is deemed appropriate by a court. In addition, increasingly aggressive tactics employed by brand companies to delay generic competition, including the use of Citizen Petitions and seeking changes to U.S.Pharmacopeia, have increased the risks and uncertainties regarding the timing of approval of generic products.
17 Table of Contents Litigation alleging infringement of patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights may be costly and time consuming. Refer to ITEM1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business Third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products and Legal Matters in NOTE24 Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this document.
Government Regulation and Regulatory Matters The following discussion focuses on key markets to the Companys overall business.
United States All pharmaceutical manufacturers, including Actavis, are subject to extensive, complex and evolving regulation by the federal government, principally the FDA, and to a lesser extent, by the U.S.Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration and state government agencies, as well as by various regulatory agencies in foreign countries where our products or product candidates are being manufactured and/or marketed. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Controlled Substances Act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing, manufacturing, packing, labeling, storing, record keeping, safety, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of our products. In our international markets, the approval, manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products is similar to the United States with some variations dependent upon local market dynamics.
FDA approval is required before any dosage form of any new drug, including an off-patent equivalent of a previously approved drug, can be marketed. The process for obtaining governmental approval to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products is rigorous, time-consuming and costly, and the extent to which it may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments cannot be predicted. We are dependent on receiving FDA and other governmental approvals prior to manufacturing, marketing and shipping new products. Refer to ITEM1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business If we are unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products, our operating results will suffer and Extensive industry regulation has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business, especially our product development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities in this document.
All applications for FDA approval must contain information relating to product formulation, raw material suppliers, stability, manufacturing processes, packaging, labeling and quality control. There are generally two types of applications for FDA approval that would be applicable to our new products:  NDA.
We file a New Drug Application (NDA) when we seek approval for drugs with active ingredients and/or with dosage strengths, dosage forms, delivery systems or pharmacokinetic profiles that have not been previously approved by the FDA. Generally, NDAs are filed for newly developed brand products or for a new dosage form of previously approved drugs.
ANDA.
We file an ANDA when we seek approval for off-patent or generic equivalents of a previously approved drug.
For innovative or non-generic new drugs, an FDA-approved NDA is required before the drug may be marketed in the United States. The NDA must contain data to demonstrate that the drug is safe and effective for its intended uses and that it will be manufactured to appropriate quality standards. In order to demonstrate safety and effectiveness, an NDA generally must include or reference pre-clinical studies and clinical data from controlled trials in humans. For a new chemical entity, this generally means that lengthy, uncertain and rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing must be conducted. For compounds that have a record of prior or current use, it may be possible to utilize existing data or medical literature and limited new testing to support an NDA. Any pre-clinical testing that we wish to rely upon for FDA action must comply with the FDAs good laboratory practice and other requirements. Clinical testing in human subjects must be conducted in accordance with the FDAs good clinical practice and other requirements. In order to initiate a clinical trial, the sponsor must submit an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) to the FDA or meet one of the narrow exemptions that exist from the IND requirement.
18 Table of Contents The FDA can, and does, reject NDAs, require additional clinical trials, or grant approvals on a restricted basis only, even when product candidates performed well in clinical trials. In addition, the FDA may approve an NDA subject to post-approval studies or monitoring requirements, or require that other risk management measures be utilized in connection with the product. There are also requirements to conduct pediatric trials for all new NDAs and supplements to NDAs, unless a waiver or deferral applies.
Similarly, FDA approval of an ANDA is required before we may begin marketing an off-patent or generic equivalent of a drug that has been approved under an NDA, or a previously unapproved dosage form of a drug that has been approved under an NDA. The ANDA approval process generally differs from the NDA approval process in that it does not typically require new preclinical and clinical studies; instead, it relies on the clinical studies establishing safety and efficacy conducted for the previously approved NDA drug. The ANDA process, however, typically requires data to show that the ANDA drug is bioequivalent to the previously approved drug. Bioequivalence compares the bioavailability of one drug product with another and, when established, indicates whether the rate and extent of absorption of a generic drug in the body are substantially equivalent to the previously approved drug. Bioavailability establishes the rate and extent of absorption, as determined by the time dependent concentrations of a drug product in the bloodstream or body needed to produce a therapeutic effect. The ANDA drug development and approval process generally takes three to four years, which is less time than the NDA drug development and approval process since the ANDAprocess does not require new clinical trials establishing the safety and efficacy of the drug product.
Supplemental NDAs or ANDAs are required for, among other things, approval to transfer certain products from one manufacturing site to another or to change an API supplier, and may be under review for a year or more. In addition, certain products may only be approved for transfer once new bioequivalency studies are conducted or other requirements are satisfied.
To obtain FDA approval of both NDAs and ANDAs, our manufacturing procedures and operations must conform to FDA quality system and control requirements generally referred to as current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), as defined in Title21 of the U.S.Code of Federal Regulations. These regulations encompass all aspects of the production process from receipt and qualification of components to distribution procedures for finished products. They are evolving standards; thus, we must continue to expend substantial time, money and effort in all production and quality control areas to maintain compliance. The evolving and complex nature of regulatory requirements, the broad authority and discretion of the FDA, and the generally high level of regulatory oversight results in the continuing possibility that we may be adversely affected by regulatory actions despite our efforts to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements.
We are subject to the periodic inspection of our facilities, procedures and operations and/or the testing of our products by the FDA, the DEA and other authorities, which conduct periodic inspections to assess compliance with applicable regulations. In addition, in connection with its review of our applications for new products, the FDA conducts pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems and processes comply with cGMP and other FDA regulations. Among other things, the FDA may withhold approval of NDAs, ANDAs or other product applications of a facility if deficiencies are found at that facility. Vendors that supply finished products or components to us that we use to manufacture, package and label products are subject to similar regulation and periodic inspections.
Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form483 and Warning Letters that could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection. A Form483 notice is generally issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection and lists conditions the FDA investigators believe may violate cGMP or other FDA regulations. FDA guidelines specify that a Warning Letter be issued only for violations of regulatory significance for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action.
Failure to comply with FDA and other governmental regulations can result in fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDAs review of NDAs, ANDAs or other product application enforcement actions, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Under certain circumstances, the FDA also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals. Although we have internal compliance programs, if these programs do 19 Table of Contents not meet regulatory agency standards or if our compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way, it could have a material adverse effect on us. Refer to ITEM1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business Extensive industry regulation has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business, especially our product development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities. in this document. The Generic Drug Enforcement Act of 1992 established penalties for wrongdoing in connection with the development or submission of an ANDA. Under this Act, the FDA has the authority to permanently or temporarily bar companies or individuals from submitting or assisting in the submission of an ANDA, and to temporarily deny approval to and suspend applications to market generic drugs. The FDA may also suspend the distribution of all drugs approved or developed in connection with certain wrongful conduct and/or withdraw approval of an ANDA and seek civil penalties. The FDA can also significantly delay the approval of any pending NDA, ANDA or other regulatory submissions under the Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery and Illegal Gratuities Policy Act.
U.S.Government reimbursement programs include Medicare, Medicaid, TriCare, and State Pharmacy Assistance Programs established according to statute, government regulations and policy. Federal law requires that all pharmaceutical manufacturers, as a condition of having their products receive federal reimbursement under Medicaid, must pay rebates to state Medicaid programs on units of their pharmaceuticals that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries. With enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the ACA), the required per-unit rebate for products marketed under ANDAs increased from 11% of the average manufacturer price to 13%. Additionally, for products marketed under NDAs, the manufacturers rebate increased from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price, or the difference between the average manufacturer price and the lowest net sales price to a non-government customer during a specified period. In some states, supplemental rebates are required as a condition of including the manufacturers drug on the states Preferred Drug List.
The ACA also made substantial changes to reimbursement when seniors reach the Medicare PartD coverage gap donut hole. By 2020, Medicare beneficiaries will pay 25% of drug costs when they reach the coverage threshold the same percentage they were responsible for before they reached that threshold.
The cost of closing the donut hole is being borne by generic and brand drug companies. Beginning in 2011, brand drug manufacturers were required to provide a 50% discount on their drugs. Additionally, beginning in 2013, the government began providing subsidies for brand-name drugs bought by seniors who enter the coverage gap. The governments share started at 2.5%, but will increase to 25% by 2020. At that point, the combined industry discounts and government subsidies will add up to 75% of brand-name drug costs. Government subsidies currently cover 7% of generic drug costs. The government will subsidize additional portions each year until 2020, when federal government subsidies will cover 75% of generic drug costs. By 2020, the donut hole will be completely closed through these manufacturers subsidies.
The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) mandated a number of changes in the Medicaid program, including the use of Average Manufacturers Price (AMP) as the basis for reimbursement to pharmaceutical companies that dispense generic drugs under the Medicaid program. Three health care reform bills passed in 2010 significantly changed the definition of AMP, effective October1, 2010. These legislative changes were part of the ACA and the FAA Air Transportation Modernization& Safety Improvement Act (the Transportation Bill). The impact of this legislation was that there were increases in Medicaid reimbursement to pharmacies for generics. These changes became effective on October1, 2010.
On November9, 2010, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a final rule withdrawing and amending regulations that have governed the calculation of AMP and the establishment of federal upper limits since October 2007. The regulations were withdrawn to mandate AMP calculation under the revised drug rebate statute. The withdrawal required manufacturers to base October 2010 and subsequent months AMPs on the statutory language until official guidance is issued.
In the absence of regulatory guidance governing the AMP calculation, CMS had instructed pharmaceutical manufacturers to base their AMP calculations on the definitions set forth in the statute, as amended by the ACA, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, and the Transportation Bill. On January27, 2012, CMS 20 Table of Contents issued proposed rules on Medicaid pharmacy reimbursement using the AMP model. Actavis has adopted mechanisms to ensure that we are calculating and reporting AMP in a manner that is consistent with the text and intent of the statute and the proposed rules.
In addition, in connection with the commercialization of our products, we have obtained authorization to receive reimbursement at varying levels for the cost of certain products and related treatments from government authorities and private health insurers and other organizations, such as Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and Managed Care Organizations (MCOs).
Federal, state, local and foreign laws of general applicability, such as laws regulating working conditions, also govern us. In addition, we are subject, as are all manufacturers generally, to numerous and increasingly stringent federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances and the discharge of pollutants into the air and water. Environmental permits and controls are required for some of our operations, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by the issuing authorities. Our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations or increased manufacturing activities at any of our facilities. We could be adversely affected by any failure to comply with environmental laws, including the costs of undertaking a clean-up at a site to which our wastes were transported.
As part of the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), companies are required to file with the U.S.Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice certain types of agreements entered into between brand and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture, marketing and sale of generic versions of brand drugs. This requirement could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with brand pharmaceutical companies, and could result generally in an increase in private-party litigation against pharmaceutical companies. The impact of this requirement, and the potential private-party lawsuits associated with arrangements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers, is uncertain and could adversely affect our business. For example, in January 2009, the FTC and the State of California filed a lawsuit against us alleging that our settlement with Solvay related to our ANDA for a generic version of Androgel  is unlawful. Beginning in February 2009, several private parties purporting to represent various classes of plaintiffs filed similar lawsuits. Those lawsuits, as well as additional suits challenging the validity of our settlements related generic versions of Actos  , Cipro  , Lidoderm  , Loestrin  24 and Opana ER  , remain pending.
Additionally, we may, and have, received requests for information, sometimes in the form of civil investigative demands or subpoenas, from the FTC and the European Competition Commission, and are subject to ongoing FTC and European Competition Commission investigations. Two of our Arrow Group subsidiaries are the subject of a European Competition Commission Statement of Objection related to their 2002 and 2003 settlements of patent litigation related to citalopram. Any adverse outcome of these or other investigations or actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Refer to ITEM1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our BusinessFederal regulation of arrangements between manufacturers of brand and generic products could adversely affect our business. Also refer to Legal Matters in NOTE24 Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this document.
Our Anda Distribution operations and our customers are also subject to various regulatory requirements, including requirements from the DEA, FDA, and state boards of pharmacy and city and county health regulators, among others. These include licensing, registration, recordkeeping, security and reporting requirements. For example, the DEA requires our Anda Distribution business to monitor customer orders of DEA Scheduled Drugs and to report suspicious orders to the DEA. Any determination by the DEA that we have failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in the DEA suspending, terminating or refusing to renew Anda Distributions license to distribute Scheduled Drugs. Additionally, numerous states and the federal government have begun to enforce anti-counterfeit drug pedigree laws which require the tracking of all transactions involving prescription drugs beginning with the manufacturer, through the supply chain, and down to the pharmacy or other health care provider dispensing or administering prescription drug products. For example, the Florida Department of 21 Table of Contents Health enforces drug pedigree requirements for distribution of prescription drugs in the State of Florida. Pursuant to Florida law and regulations, wholesalers and distributors, including our subsidiary, Anda, are required to maintain records documenting the chain of custody of prescription drug products they distribute beginning with the purchase of such products from the manufacturer. These entities are required to provide documentation of the prior transaction(s) to their customers in Florida, including pharmacies and other health care entities. Several other states have proposed or enacted legislation to implement similar or more stringent drug pedigree requirements. In addition, federal law requires that a non-authorized distributor of record must provide a drug pedigree documenting the prior purchase of a prescription drug from the manufacturer or from an authorized distributor of record. In cases where the wholesaler or distributor selling the drug product is not deemed an authorized distributor of record, it would need to maintain such records. Refer to ITEM1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business  Extensive industry regulation has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business, especially our product development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities in this document.
European Union We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are regulated in the European Union (the EU) by the European Medicines Agency (the EMA). All manufacturers are required to submit medicinal products, including generic versions of previously approved products and new strengths, dosages and formulations of previously approved products, to the EMA and its member states for review and marketing authorization before such products are placed on the market in the EU.
Marketing authorizations are granted to applicants after the relevant health authority issues a positive assessment of quality, safety and efficacy of the product. In order to receive such assessment, applicants must submit applications, which must contain the results of pre-clinical tests, pharmaceutical tests, and clinical trials with respect to original products, or originator data with respect to the generic versions of previously approved products. All of these tests or trials must be conducted in accordance within European regulations and must allow the reviewing body to evaluate the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product.
In addition to obtaining marketing authorization for each product, all member states require that a manufacturers facilities obtain approval from the national authority. The EU has a code of good manufacturing practices that each manufacturer must follow and comply with. Regulatory authorities in the EU may conduct inspections of the manufacturing facilities to review procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. Refer to ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS  Risks Related to Our Business  The supply of APIs into Europe may be negatively affected by recent regulations promulgated by the European Union in this document.
In the EU, member states regulate the pricing of pharmaceutical products, and in some cases, the formulation and dosing of products. This regulation is handled by individual member state national health services. These individual regulatory bodies can result in considerable price differences and product availability among member states. The implementation of tendering systems for the pricing of pharmaceuticals in several countries generally impacts drug pricing for generics; generally tendering refers to a system that requires bids to be submitted to the government by competing manufacturers to be the exclusive, or one of a few, supplier(s) of a product in a particular country.
Further, faced with major budget constraints, many European countries have resorted to price cuts that affect both innovative and generic pharmaceuticals although in some countries it has disproportionately affected generic products. Refer to ITEM1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our BusinessGlobal economic conditions could harm us  in this document. In addition, some EU countries such as France, Serbia and Spain, recently had to address statements and rumors claiming that generics are not as safe and effective as reference drugs, which may undermine efforts to increase generic utilization rates.
Canada In Canada, pharmaceutical manufacturers are regulated by the Therapeutic Products Directorate (the TPD) which derives its authority from the Canadian federal government under the Food and Drugs Act and the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The TPD evaluates and monitors the safety, effectiveness and quality of pharmaceutical products. Products are officially approved for marketing in Canada following receipt of a market 22 Table of Contents authorization, or Notice of Compliance (an NOC), which is subject to the Food and Drug Regulations. Issuance of an NOC for generic drug products is also subject to the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations (the NOC Regulations) under the Patent Act.
In Canada, the registration process for approval of generic pharmaceuticals has two tracks that proceed in parallel. To obtain an NOC for a generic drug, a company submits an application called an abbreviated new drug submission (ANDS) to Health Canada, which compares the drug to a reference product that is marketed in Canada under a NOC issued to a first person. The first track of the process involves an examination of the ANDS and proposed generic product by Health Canada to ensure that the quality, safety and efficacy of the proposed generic product meet Canadian standards and bioequivalence. The second track is governed by the NOC Regulations and links the grant of an NOC for the proposed generic to patent rights related to the reference product. Health Canada will grant an NOC when it is satisfied that the generic pharmaceutical product described in the ANDS is safe and efficacious and the requirements under the NOC Regulations are met.
The NOC Regulations allow branded drug marketers to list patents relating to the medicinal ingredient, formulation, dosage form or the use of the medicinal ingredient in their branded drug on a patent register maintained by Health Canada. In its ANDS, a generic applicant must address each patent listed against the reference product by making at least one statutory allowed allegation (for example, alleging that the patent is invalid or would not be infringed). If the generic applicant alleges invalidity or non-infringement, it must provide the branded manufacturer with an explanation of its allegations. Upon receipt of the explanation, the branded manufacturer may apply to the Federal Court of Canada for an Order prohibiting Health Canada from issuing an NOC for the generic. Health Canada may not issue a NOC until the earlier of the determination of the application by the court after a hearing on the allegations, or the expiration of 24 months from the commencement of the application.
Facilities, procedures, operations and/or testing of products are subject to periodic inspection by Health Canada and the Health Products and Food Branch Inspectorate. In addition, Health Canada conducts pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems are in compliance with the good manufacturing practices in Canada, Drug Establishment Licensing requirements and other provisions of the NOC Regulations. Competitors are subject to similar regulations and inspections.
Each Canadian province also provides a comprehensive public drug program, which controls drug pricing and reimbursement and is responsible for ensuring eligible patients receive drugs through public funding. The provinces and territories in Canada operate drug benefit programs through which eligible recipients receive drugs through public funding; these drugs are listed on provincial or territorial Drug Benefit Formularies (Formularies). Eligible recipients include seniors, persons on social assistance, low-income earners, and those with certain specified conditions or diseases. Formulary listings are also used by private payors to reimburse generic products. To be listed in a Formulary, drug products must have been issued a NOC and must comply with each jurisdictions individual review process. Currently, Canadas provinces are looking at national competitive bidding processes/tendering of drugs, which may affect the sustainability of the industry and the supply of pharmaceuticals.
Finally, Canada has reached a trade agreement in principle with the European Union (CETA) in which it has agreed to implement patent term extensions and certain procedural amendments to the NOC Regulations. Canada is further involved in trade negotiations with ten Pacific countries including the United States (the Trans Pacific Partnership), which could lead to further changes to Canadas intellectual property framework, which could delay generic competition.
Russia In Russia, Federal Law on the Circulation of Medicines, effective from January9, 2010 (the Russian Pharmaceutical Law), establishes the general framework of legal requirements applicable to the development, production, trials, quality control, efficacy, safety, importation and sale of pharmaceutical products in Russia.
Given the importance to the public of the health care sector, and providing the population with safe and high quality pharmaceuticals, the Russian Pharmaceutical Law makes it a priority for the state to control the production, quality, efficacy, and safety of pharmaceuticals.
23 Table of Contents Russias pharmaceutical market consists largely of an out-of-pocket retail market, and the retail market is driven by the promotion of branded products, including both originator and branded generics. A trend of increases in the cost of health care has drawn public scrutiny. Government budget constraints may impact the timing of market entry and/or adversely affect pricing, and compel the government to resort to a tendering model. This could create new challengesparticularly for foreign companies, as along with downward pricing pressures, Russia tends to favor domestically based producers.
Environmental Matters We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations in the United States and abroad. We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations in each jurisdiction where we have a business presence. Although we continue to make capital expenditures for environmental protection, we do not anticipate any significant expenditure in order to comply with such laws and regulations that would have a material impact on our earnings or competitive position. We are not aware of any pending litigation or significant financial obligations arising from current or past environmental practices that are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position. We cannot assure you, however, that environmental problems relating to facilities owned or operated by us will not develop in the future, and we cannot predict whether any such problems, if they were to develop, could require significant expenditures on our part. In addition, we are unable to predict what legislation or regulations may be adopted or enacted in the future with respect to environmental protection and waste disposal. Refer to ITEM1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business  Our business will continue to expose us to risks of environmental liabilities in this document.
Seasonality There are no significant seasonal aspects that are expected to materially impact our business.
Backlog As a result of the extent of our supply chain, backlog of orders is not material to our business.
Employees As of December31, 2014, we had approximately 21,600 employees. Of our employees, approximately 2,070 were engaged in R&D, 7,600 in manufacturing, 2,400 in quality assurance and quality control, 8,580 in sales, marketing and distribution, and 950in administration.

RISK FACTORS CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Any statements made in this report that are not statements of historical fact or that refer to estimated or anticipated future events are forward-looking statements. We have based our forward-looking statements on managements beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time these statements are made. Such forward-looking statements reflect our current perspective of our business, future performance, existing trends and information as of the date of this filing. These include, but are not limited to, our beliefs about future revenue and expense levels and growth rates, prospects related to our strategic initiatives and business strategies, including the integration of, and synergies associated with, strategic acquisitions, express or implied assumptions about government regulatory action or inaction, anticipated product approvals and launches, business initiatives and product development activities, assessments related to clinical trial results, product performance and competitive environment, and anticipated financial performance. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, words such as may, will, expect, believe, anticipate, plan, intend, could, would, should, estimate, continue, or pursue, or the negative or other variations thereof or comparable terminology, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and 24 Table of Contents assumptions that are difficult to predict. We caution the reader that these statements are based on certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, certain important factors may affect our actual operating results and could cause such results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. We believe the risks and uncertainties discussed under the section entitled Risks Related to Our Business, and other risks and uncertainties detailed herein and from time to time in our SEC filings, may cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statement.
We disclaim any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. This discussion is provided as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. The following discussion highlights some of these risks and speaks as of the date of this document. These and other risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Risks Related to Our Business If we are unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products, our operating results will suffer.
Our future results of operations depend to a significant extent upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new brand and generic products in a timely manner. There are numerous difficulties in developing and commercializing new products, including:  developing, testing and manufacturing products in compliance with regulatory standards in a timely manner;  receiving requisite regulatory approvals for such products in a timely manner, or at all;  the availability, on commercially reasonable terms, of raw materials, including API and other key ingredients;  preclusion from commercialization by the proprietary rights of others;  developing products that are economical to manufacture and commercialize;  time consuming and costly nature of developing and commercializing new products;  costly legal actions brought by our competitors, that may delay or prevent the development and commercialization of new products;  experiencing delays as a result of limited resources at the FDA or other regulatory agencies;  changing review and approval policies and standards at the FDA and other regulatory agencies; and  commercializing generic products may be substantially delayed by the listing with the FDA of patents that have the effect of potentially delaying approval of a generic product by up to 30 months.
As a result of these and other difficulties, products currently in development by us may or may not receive timely regulatory approvals, or approvals at all, necessary for marketing by us or other third-party partners. This risk particularly exists with respect to the development of proprietary products because of the uncertainties, higher costs and lengthy time frames associated with R&D of such products and the inherent unproven market acceptance of such products. Our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate as the amount we spend to research and develop, promote, acquire or license new products, technologies and businesses changes. Additionally, we face heightened risks in connection with our development of extended release or controlled release generic products because of the technical difficulties and regulatory requirements related to such products. Additionally, with respect to generic products for which we are the first applicant to request approval on the basis that an innovator patent is invalid or not infringed (a Paragraph IV filing), our ability to obtain 180 days of generic market exclusivity may be contingent on our ability to obtain FDA approval or tentative approval 25 Table of Contents within 30 months of the FDAs acceptance of our application for filing. We therefore risk forfeiting such market exclusivity if we are unable to obtain such approval or tentative approval on a timely basis. If any of our products or the products of our third-party partners are not approved timely or, when acquired or developed and approved, cannot be successfully manufactured or commercialized in a timely manner, our operating results could be adversely affected. We cannot guarantee that any investment we make in developing products will be recouped, even if we are successful in commercializing those products. Refer to Our branded pharmaceutical expenditures may not result in commercially successful products .
Our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate.
Our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year for a number of reasons. As a result, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful, and these comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. In particular, as a pharmaceutical company that manufactures and sells both branded and generic products, the development and launch of new competitive products or generics by ourselves and may result in fluctuations in our financial performance, particularly as we work to balance our product offerings in light of our recent and future growth via acquisitions. Our operating results and financial condition are also subject to fluctuation from all of the risks described throughout this section. These fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions.
If we do not successfully integrate newly acquired businesses into our business operations, our business could be adversely affected.
We will need to successfully integrate the operations of recently and pending acquired businesses, including Allergan, Forest and Furiex, with our business operations. As a result of these recent and pending acquisitions, we have undergone substantial changes in a short period of time and our business has changed and broadened in size and the scope of products we offer. Integrating the operations of multiple new businesses with that of our own is a complex, costly and time-consuming process, which results in significant management attention and resources to integrate the business practice and operations. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, would preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the businesses in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations. Prior to each acquisition, the acquired business operated independently, with its own business, corporate culture, locations, employees and systems. There may be substantial difficulties, costs and delays involved in any integration of other businesses with that of our own. These may include:  distracting management from day-to-day operations;  potential incompatibility of corporate cultures;  an inability to achieve synergies as planned;  risks associated with the assumption of contingent or other liabilities of acquisition targets;  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers or customers;  inheriting and uncovering previously unknown issues, problems and costs from the acquired company;  delays between our expenditures to acquire new products, technologies or businesses and the generation of revenues from those acquired products, technologies or businesses;  realization of assets and settlement of liabilities at amounts equal to estimated fair value as of the acquisition date of any acquisition or disposition;  revenue recognition related to licensing agreements and/or strategic collaborations;  costs and delays in implementing common systems and procedures (including technology, compliance programs, financial systems, distribution and general business operations, among others); and  increased difficulties in managing our business due to the addition of international locations.
26 Table of Contents These risks may be heightened in cases where the majority of the former businesses operations, employees and customers are located outside of the United States. Any one or all of these factors may increase operating costs or lower anticipated financial performance. Many of these factors are also outside of our control. In addition, dispositions of certain key products, technologies and other rights may affect our business operations.
Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if the operations of the businesses are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses. All of these factors could cause a reduction to our earnings per share, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transaction, and negatively impact the price of the Actavis plc Ordinary Shares.
The failure to integrate the business operations of the acquired business successfully would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our substantial debt and other financial obligations could impair our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our debt obligations. Any refinancing of this substantial debt could be at significantly higher interest rates.
Our substantial indebtedness and other financial obligations could:  impair our ability to obtain financing or additional debt in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes;  impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us;  have a material adverse effect on us if we fail to comply with financial and affirmative and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements and an event of default occurs as a result of a failure that is not cured or waived;  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow for interest payments on our indebtedness and other financial obligations, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital and capital expenditures;  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionally less debt.
Additionally, certain of our financing agreements may contain cross-default or other similar provisions whereby a default under one financing agreement could result in a default under our other financing agreements.
If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations and other financial obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness and other financial transactions, seek additional equity capital or sell our assets. We might then be unable to obtain such financing or capital or sell our assets on satisfactory terms, if at all. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at significantly higher interest rates, and/or incur significant transaction fees. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources  Credit Facility Indebtedness and Liquidity and Capital Resources  Senior Note Indebtedness for a detailed discussion of our outstanding indebtedness.
Any acquisitions of businesses, technologies, or products or other significant transactions could adversely affect our relationships with employees, vendors or key customers.
We regularly review potential acquisitions of technologies, products and businesses complementary to our business. Acquisitions typically entail many risks and could result in difficulties in integrating operations, personnel, technologies and products. Refer to If we do not successfully integrate newly acquired businesses into our business operations our business could be adversely affected.
In connection with acquisitions, we could experience disruption in our business, technology and information systems, financial systems, vendors customer 27 Table of Contents or employee base, including diversion of managements attention from our continuing operations, among others. Refer to Certain aspects of our operations are highly dependent on third party service providers.
There is also a risk that key employees of companies that we acquire or key employees necessary to successfully commercialize technologies and products that we acquire may seek employment elsewhere, including with our competitors. Furthermore, there may be overlap between our products or customers and the companies that we acquire that may create conflicts in relationships or other commitments detrimental to the integrated businesses.
We are subject to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, and the failure to comply with such laws may adversely affect our business.
In the United States, many of our products are reimbursed under federal and state health care programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, TriCare, and/or state pharmaceutical assistance programs, and as a result, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients rights are and will be applicable to our business. We could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to: (i)the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, which constrains our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, by prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; (ii)federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent; (iii)the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (HIPAA), which among other things created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters, and HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information and places restrictions on the use of such information for marketing communications; (iv)the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which among other things, requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under a federal healthcare program to report annually information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by certain healthcare professionals and their immediate family members; and (v)state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above U.S. laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. Violations of the fraud and abuse laws may result in severe penalties against the responsible employees and Actavis, including jail sentences, large fines, and the exclusion of our products from reimbursement under federal and state programs. Defense of litigation claims and government investigations can be costly, time-consuming, and distract management, and it is possible that Actavis could incur judgments or enter into settlements that would require us to change the way we operate our business. We are committed to conducting the sales and marketing of our products in compliance with the healthcare fraud and abuse laws, but certain applicable laws may impose liability even in the absence of specific intent to defraud. Furthermore, should there be ambiguity, a governmental authority may take a position contrary to a position we have taken, or should an employee violate these laws without our knowledge, a governmental authority may impose civil and/or criminal sanctions.
For example, in December 2009, we learned that numerous pharmaceutical companies, including certain of our subsidiaries, have been named as defendants in a federal qui tam action pending in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts alleging that the defendants falsely reported to the United States that certain pharmaceutical products were eligible for Medicaid reimbursement and thereby allegedly caused false claims for payment to be made through the Medicaid program. A similar action was filed by the State of Louisiana in August 2013 and additional lawsuits are possible. Any adverse outcome in these actions, or the imposition of penalties or sanctions for failing to comply with the fraud and abuse laws, could adversely affect us 28 Table of Contents and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Some of the statutes and regulations that govern our activities, such as federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, are broad in scope, and while exemptions and safe harbors protecting certain common activities exist, they are often narrowly drawn. While we manage our business activities to comply with these statutory provisions, due to their breadth, complexity and, in certain cases, uncertainty of application, it is possible that our activities could be subject to challenge by various government agencies. In particular, the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice and other agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the sales, marketing, research and similar activities of pharmaceutical companies in recent years, and many pharmaceutical companies have been subject to government investigations related to these practices. A determination that we are in violation of these and/or other government regulations and legal requirements may result in civil damages and penalties, criminal fines and prosecution, administrative remedies, the recall of products, the total or partial suspension of manufacture and/or distribution, seizure of products, injunctions, whistleblower lawsuits, failure to obtain approval of pending product applications, withdrawal of existing product approvals, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and other sanctions.
Beginning in February 2012, Warner Chilcott, along with several then current and former employees in its sales organization and certain third parties, received subpoenas from the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts. The subpoena Warner Chilcott received sought information and documentation relating to a wide range of matters, including sales and marketing activities, payments to people who are in a position to recommend drugs, medical education, consultancies, prior authorization processes, clinical trials, off-label promotion and employee training (including with respect to laws and regulations concerning off-label information and physician remuneration), in each case relating to all of our current key products. Warner Chilcott is currently defending qui tam litigations based on allegations relating to its sales practices. In addition, Forest is also currently responding to subpoenas seeking information relating to its sales and marketing activities, including payments to people who are in a position to recommend drugs and off-label promotion and the Company is defending litigations based on similar allegations. Refer to Legal Matters in NOTE 24  Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. We cannot predict or determine the impact of this inquiry on our future financial condition or results of operations. The U.S. Attorneys investigations and any other threatened or actual government enforcement action could also generate adverse publicity and require that we devote substantial resources that could be used productively on other aspects of our business.
Furthermore, in connection with a settlement of certain claims brought by the U.S. government, Forest operated under a Corporate Integrity Agreement (the CIA) with the Office of Inspector General of Health and Human Services that requires us to maintain Forests compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations until September 2015. The CIA also provides for an independent third-party review organization to assess and report on our compliance program. While we expect to fully and timely comply with all of our assumed obligations under the CIA, the failure to do so could result in substantial penalties and being excluded from government healthcare programs.
Any of these types of investigations or enforcement actions could affect our ability to commercially distribute our products and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
If generic products that compete with any of our branded pharmaceutical products are approved and sold, sales of our products will be adversely affected.
As a result of our mergers with Forest and Warner Chilcott, and our expected acquisition of Allergan, specialty branded products now comprise a larger percentage of our total revenues and are expected to grow with the acquisition of Allergan. Generic equivalents for branded pharmaceutical products are typically sold at lower costs than the branded products. After the introduction of a competing generic product, a significant percentage of the prescriptions previously written for the branded product are often written for the generic version. In addition, legislation enacted in most U.S. states and Canadian provinces allows or, in some instances mandates, that a pharmacist dispense an available generic equivalent when filling a prescription for a branded product, in the absence of specific instructions from the prescribing physician. Pursuant to the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act, manufacturers of branded products often bring lawsuits to enforce their patent rights against 29 Table of Contents generic products released prior to the expiration of branded products patents, but it is possible for generic manufacturers to offer generic products while such litigation is pending. Refer to If we are unable to adequately protect our technology or enforce our patents, our business could suffer . As a result, branded products typically experience a significant loss in revenues following the introduction of a competing generic product, even if subject to an existing patent. Our branded pharmaceutical products are or may become subject to competition from generic equivalents because there is no proprietary protection for some of the branded pharmaceutical products we sell, because our patent protection expires or because our patent protection is not sufficiently broad or enforceable. In addition, we may not be successful in our efforts to extend the proprietary protection afforded our branded products through the development and commercialization of proprietary product improvements and new and enhanced dosage forms.
Our Actonel  products no longer have patent protection in Canada or the Western European countries in which we sell these products, and Asacol  is not protected by a patent in the United Kingdom. Our Actonel  once-a-month product lost U.S. patent protection in June 2014 (including a 6-month pediatric extension of regulatory exclusivity) and generic versions of our Loestrin  24 Fe product entered the market in January 2014 pursuant to settlement agreements previously entered into. In addition, other products such as Estrace  Cream, Asacol  400 mg, Femhrt  and Carafate  are not protected by patents in the United States where we sell these products. Generic equivalents are currently available in Canada and Western Europe for Actonel  and in the United States for certain versions of our Femhrt  products, Femcon  Fe and certain other less significant products.
During the next few years, additional products of ours including some of our large revenue drivers, like Bystolic  , Linzess  and Viibryd  , will lose patent protection or likely become subject to generic competition. Generic versions of our Asacol  HD 800 mg product may enter the market as early as November 2015 pursuant to an agreement previously entered into and generic versions of our Enablex  product may enter the market as early as March 2016 pursuant to settlement agreements previously entered into. Some of our products may also become subject to generic competition prior to the expiration of patent protection in the event a generic competitor elects to launch its generic equivalent product at-risk. Competition from generic equivalents could result in a material impairment of our intangible assets or the acceleration of amortization on our non-impaired intangible assets and may have a material adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our branded pharmaceutical expenditures may not result in commercially successful products.
Developing and commercializing branded pharmaceutical products is generally more costly than generic products. In the future, and particularly following the Warner Chilcott Acquisition the Forest Acquisition, and the Pending Allergan Acquisition, we anticipate continuing and increasing our product development expenditures for our North American Brands business segment, including products acquired from Warner Chilcott and Forest, and may include Allergan products. In order to grow and achieve success in our business, we must continually identify, develop, acquire and license new products that we can ultimately market. There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development, and there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and payer reimbursement, limited scope of approved uses, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Products that do reach the market may ultimately be subject to recalls or other suspensions in sales. Delays and uncertainties in the FDA approval process and the approval processes in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. Because there is a high rate of failure inherent in the research and development process of new products, there is a significant risk that funds invested by the Company in research and development will not generate financial returns. The Company cannot be certain when or whether any of its products currently under development will be approved or launched or whether, once launched, such products will be commercially successful.
30 Table of Contents We may be required to spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. The length of time, number of trial sites and patients required for clinical trials vary substantially, and we may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of sites and subjects to participate in our trials. Delays in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, delays in regulatory approvals and delays in product candidates reaching the market. We rely on independent third-party clinical investigators to recruit subjects and conduct clinical trials in accordance with applicable study protocols and laws and regulations. If regulatory authorities determine that we have not complied with regulations in the R&D of a product candidate, they may refuse to accept trial data from the site, not approve the product candidate, and we would not be able to market and sell it. If we are not able to market and sell our products or product candidates after significant expenditures to develop and test them, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
We currently have products in various stages of development. For example in 2013, we initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial for our Esmya product for treatment of uterine fibroids. We also have new hormonal contraceptive therapy products in various stages of development from preclinical development to Phase 3 development, as well as osteoporosis products in preclinical and clinical development and dermatology and infectious disease products in various stages of clinical development, among others. Such clinical trials are costly and may not result in successful outcomes. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical studies may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical studies. Product candidates that have shown promising results in early-stage clinical studies may still suffer significant setbacks in subsequent clinical studies. There is a high rate of failure for products proceeding through clinical studies, and product candidates in later stages of clinical studies may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical studies. Clinical studies may not proceed as planned or be completed on schedule, if at all. The rate of completion of clinical trials is significantly dependent upon a number of factors, including the rate of patient enrollment. We may not be able to attract a sufficient number of sites or enroll a sufficient number of patients in a timely manner in order to complete clinical trials. Moreover, nonclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and our data may not provide adequate efficacy and safety information to obtain regulatory approval of our candidates. We cannot be sure that our business expenditures, including but not limited to our expenditures related to our Esmya product, JNJ-Q2 product, products acquired in the Warner Chilcott Acquisition and the Forest Acquisition, products that are expected to be acquired in the Pending Allergan Acquisition or products of our third-party partners, among others, will result in the successful discovery, development or launch of brand products that will prove to be commercially successful or will improve the long-term profitability of our business. If such business expenditures do not result in successful discovery, development or launch of commercially successful brand products our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
Our investments in biosimilar products may not result in products that are approved by the FDA or other ex- U.S. regulatory authorities and, even if approved by such authorities, may not result in commercially successful products.
In 2011, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Amgen Inc. to develop and commercialize, on a worldwide basis, biosimilar versions of Herceptin  , Avastin  , Rituxan/Mab Thera  , and Erbitux  (the Amgen Collaboration Agreement). Under the agreement, we will be required to invest up to $254.8 million (as of December31, 2014) in furtherance of the development and regulatory approval of such products, and such amount is subject to change or adjustment as specified in the agreement. Although Amgen, our development partner, has substantial expertise and experience in the development of biological products, significant uncertainty remains concerning the regulatory pathway in the United States and in other countries to obtain regulatory approval of biosimilar products, and the commercial pathway to successfully market and sell such products. In the United States, an abbreviated pathway for approval of biosimilar products was established by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, enacted on March23, 2010, as part of the ACA. The BPCIA established this abbreviated pathway under section 351(k) of the Public Health Services Act, or PHSA. Subsequent to the enactment of the BPCIA, the FDA issued draft guidance regarding the demonstration of biosimilarity as well as the submission and review of biosimilar applications. However, there have been no biosimilar products approved under the 251(k) pathway to date. Further, many other markets outside of the U.S. do not yet have a legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilar products.
31 Table of Contents The BPCIA prohibits the FDA from accepting an application for a biosimilar candidate to a reference product within four years of the reference products licensure by the FDA. In addition, the BPCIA provides innovative biologics with twelve years of exclusivity from the data of their licensure, during which time the FDA cannot approve any application for a biosimilar candidate to the reference product. Additionally, biosimilar products will likely be subject to extensive patent clearances and/or patent infringement litigation, which could delay or prevent the commercial launch of a product for many years. Further, our collaboration with Amgen may not result in products that meet the requirements established by the FDA or other ex-U.S. regulatory authorities. If our collaboration does result in biosimilar products that obtain FDA or other ex-U.S. regulatory authority approval, such product(s) may not be commercially successful and/or may not generate profits in amounts that are sufficient to offset the amount invested to obtain such approvals. Market success of biosimilar products will depend on demonstrating to patients, physicians and payors that such products are safe and efficacious compared to other existing products yet offer a more competitive price or other benefit over existing therapies. If our collaboration with Amgen does not result in the development and timely approval of biosimilar products or if such products, once developed and approved, are not commercially successful, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
We expect to face increasing competition from biosimilar products in the future, particularly if foreign governments adopt more permissive approval frameworks and competitors begin to obtain broader marketing approval for biosimilar products. A growing number of companies have announced their intentions to develop biosimilar versions of existing biotechnology products. We are unable to predict the precise impact of the pending introduction of biosimilar products on our products, and additional competition could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
If we are unsuccessful in our joint ventures and other collaborations, our operating results could suffer.
We have made substantial investments in joint ventures and other collaborations, including our collaboration agreements with Amgen and Sanofi, and may use these and other methods to develop or commercialize products in the future. These arrangements typically involve other pharmaceutical companies as partners that may be competitors of ours in certain markets. In many instances, we will not control these joint ventures or collaborations or the commercial exploitation of the licensed products, and cannot assure you that these ventures will be profitable. Joint venture agreements may place limitations or restrictions on marketing our products. Any such marketing restrictions could affect future revenues and have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our results of operations may suffer if existing joint venture or collaboration partners withdraw, or if these products are not timely developed, approved or successfully commercialized and we cannot guarantee the successful outcome of such efforts, nor that they will result in any intellectual property rights or products that inure to our benefit.
If we are unable to adequately protect our technology or enforce our patents, our business could suffer.
Our success with the brand products that we develop will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for these products. We currently have a number of U.S. and foreign patents issued and pending. However, issuance of a patent is not conclusive evidence of its validity or enforceability. We cannot be sure that we will receive patents for any of our pending patent applications or any patent applications we may file in the future, or that our issued patents will be upheld if challenged. If our current and future patent applications are not approved or, if approved, our patents are not upheld in a court of law if challenged, it may reduce our ability to competitively utilize our patented products. Also, such patents may or may not provide competitive advantages for their respective products or they may be challenged or circumvented by our competitors, in which case our ability to commercially market these products may be diminished. Patent disputes may be lengthy and a potential violator of our patents may bring a potentially infringing product to market during the dispute, subjecting us to competition and damages due to infringement of the competitor product. For example, patents covering our Androderm  , Asacol  400 mg product, Actonel  once-a-week product, INFed  products and our Carafate  product have expired and we have no further patent protection on these products. During the next five years, additional products acquired pursuant to the Warner Chilcott Acquisition and the Forest Acquisition will lose patent protection or likely become subject to generic competition, including Bystolic  , Linzess  and Viibryd  . Therefore, it is possible that a competitor may launch a generic version of any of these products at any time, which would result in a significant decline in that products revenue and profit.
32 Table of Contents Generic versions of our Loestrin  24 Fe product entered the market in January 2014 pursuant to settlement agreements previously entered into; generic versions of our Asacol  HD 800 mg product may enter the market as early as November 2015 pursuant to an agreement previously entered into; our newly acquired Namenda product will lose U.S. patent protection in 2015; and generic versions of our Enablex  product may enter the market as early as March 2016 pursuant to settlement agreements previously entered into. Some of our products may also become subject to generic competition prior to the expiration of patent protection in the event a generic competitor elects to launch its generic equivalent product at-risk.
Generic competitors to our branded products may also challenge the validity or enforceability of the patents protecting our products or otherwise seek to circumvent them. For example, Warner Chilcott received a challenge relating to its Atelvia  (risedronate) 35 mg tablets product. In October 2011 and March 2012, Warner Chilcott received separate Paragraph IV certification notice letters from Watson Laboratories, Inc.  Florida (Watson), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. (Teva) and Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (Ranbaxy) indicating that each had submitted to the FDA an ANDA seeking approval to manufacture and sell a generic version of Atelvia  35 mg tablets. Warner Chilcott brought actions against each of Watson, Teva and Ranbaxy, charging each with infringement. In October 2013, Watson divested its ANDA to Amneal Pharmaceuticals (Amneal). In September 2013, Warner Chilcott received a Paragraph IV certification notice letter from Impax Laboratories, Inc. (Impax) indicating that it had submitted to the FDA an ANDA seeking approval to manufacture and sell a generic version of Atelvia  . Warner Chilcott filed a lawsuit against Impax in October 2013, asserting infringement. The Company has settled with Ranbaxy, Amneal and Impax; however, trial against Teva began on July14, 2014 and ended on July18, 2014. Similarly, Forest also recently brought actions against certain manufacturers of generic drugs for infringement of several patents covering our newly acquired Savella  , Namenda  XR and Canasa  products. We believe that ANDAs were filed before the patents covering Canasa  were listed in the Orange Book, which generally means that ANDAs are not subject to the 30-month stay of the approval under the Hatch-Waxman Act. While we intend to vigorously defend these and other patents and pursue our legal rights, we can offer no assurance as to when the pending or any future litigation will be decided, whether such lawsuits will be successful or that a generic equivalent of one or more of our products will not be approved and enter the market. In addition, patents covering our branded pharmaceutical products may be challenged in proceedings other than court proceedings, including inter partes review (IPR) at the patent and trademark office. In 2011, Congress amended the patent laws and created a new way to challenge the validity of patents: the inter partes review. IPR proceedings take place in the Patent Office and have both advantages and disadvantages when compared to district court proceedings. Although IPR proceedings are limited to certain types of invalidity challenges, the Patent Office applies different standards that make it easier for challengers to invalidate patents. Moreover, IPR proceedings generally take no more than 18 months, which means it is much faster than challenging a patents validity in a district court proceeding. In addition, an IPR challenge can be mounted even after a patent has been upheld in court. For example, the Company has recently received an IPR challenge to the patent covering its Lo Loestrin  Fe product notwithstanding that the patents validity was upheld by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. Refer to Legal Matters in NOTE 24  Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
In addition to patent protection, our business relies on our protection of other intellectual property rights, trade secrets, and other proprietary technologies. We rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights. The protection of our proprietary technology may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. We may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from misappropriating or infringing upon our proprietary rights.
We rely on certain information, processes, and know-how that are not protected by patents or other intellectual property rights. We seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements, as well as through other measures. These measures may not provide adequate protection for our unpatented technology.
If we are unable to adequately protect our technology, trade secrets or propriety know-how, or enforce our intellectual property rights, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could suffer.
33 Table of Contents Our branded pharmaceutical products will face increased competition with generic products, including our own.
As a result of our recent acquisitions, we have expanded our branded pharmaceutical products, and we face increased competition from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, including in some circumstances us. Because the regulatory approval process in the United States and European Union exempts generic products from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy and rely instead on the safety and efficacy of prior products, manufacturers of generic products can invest far less in research and development. As a result, our branded products will face intense price competition from generic forms of the product once market exclusivity has expired. Upon the expiration of market exclusivity, we may lose the majority of our revenues of that product in a very short period of time.
In addition, our branded products may conflict with our existing generic products. Because the revenues from branded products and generic products are derived using contradictory strategies, investments made in one sector may conflict with the other. For example, we now own Loestrin  / Loestrin  Fe as both a branded product and a generic product, which may directly or indirectly compete as sales of one product will inherently reduce sales of the other and decrease overall revenues. We may face the same pressures for multiple products. The expansion of our branded pharmaceutical products may result in increased competition from generic manufacturers and our own generics business.
If pharmaceutical companies are successful in limiting the use of generics through their legislative, regulatory and other efforts, our sales of generic products may suffer.
Many pharmaceutical companies increasingly have used state and federal legislative and regulatory means to delay generic competition. These efforts have included:  making changes to the formulation of the brand product and arguing that potential generic competitors must demonstrate bioequivalency or comparable abuse-resistance to the reformulated brand product;  pursuing new patents for existing products which may be granted just before the expiration of earlier patents, which could extend patent protection for additional years or otherwise delay the launch of generics;  selling the brand product as an Authorized Generic, either by the brand company directly, through an affiliate or by a marketing partner;  using the Citizen Petition process (e.g., under 21 C.F.R. s. 10.30) to request amendments to FDA standards or otherwise delay generic drug approvals;  seeking changes to U.S. Pharmacopeia, an organization which publishes industry recognized compendia of drug standards;  attempting to use the legislative and regulatory process to have drugs reclassified or rescheduled;  using the legislative and regulatory process to set definitions of abuse deteriant formulations to protect brand company patents and profits;  attaching patent extension amendments to non-related federal legislation;  engaging in state-by-state initiatives to enact legislation that restricts the substitution of some generic drugs, which could have an impact on products that we are developing;  entering into agreements with pharmacy benefit management companies which have the effect of blocking the dispensing of generic products; and  seeking patents on methods of manufacturing certain API.
If pharmaceutical companies or other third parties are successful in limiting the use of generic products through these or other means, our sales of generic products may decline. If we experience a material decline in generic product sales, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will suffer.
34 Table of Contents If competitors are successful in limiting competition for certain generic products through their legislative, regulatory and litigation efforts, our sales of certain generic products may suffer.
Certain of our competitors have challenged our ability to distribute Authorized Generics during the competitors 180-day period of ANDA exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Under the challenged arrangements, we have obtained rights to market and distribute under a brand manufacturers NDA a generic alternative of the brand product. Some of our competitors have challenged the propriety of these arrangements by filing Citizen Petitions with the FDA, initiating lawsuits alleging violation of the antitrust and consumer protection laws, and seeking legislative intervention. For example, legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Senate that would prohibit the marketing of Authorized Generics during the 180-day period of ANDA exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Act. If distribution of Authorized Generic versions of brand products is otherwise restricted or found unlawful, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
From time to time we may need to rely on licenses to proprietary technologies, which may be difficult or expensive to obtain.
We may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to develop, manufacture and market products. If we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to commercially market our products may be inhibited or prevented, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. For example, because we license significant intellectual property with respect to certain of our newly acquired products, including Namenda XR  , Linzess  and Viibryd  , any loss or suspension of our rights to licensed intellectual property could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
Third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products.
The manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry. These lawsuits relate to the validity, enforceability and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties. We may have to defend ourselves against charges that we violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties. This is especially true in the case of generic products on which the patent covering the brand product is expiring, an area where infringement litigation is prevalent, and in the case of new brand products where a competitor has obtained patents for similar products. Litigation may be costly, unpredictable, time-consuming, often involves complex legal, scientific and factual questions, and could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel. In addition, if it is determined that we infringe the rights of others, we could lose our right to develop, manufacture or market products, product launches could be delayed or we could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. For example, we are currently engaged in litigation with Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Ferring B.V. concerning whether our generic version the original (now discontinued) formulation of Opana ER infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 8,309,122 and 8,329,216, and we continue to market our generic product. We are also engaged in litigation with Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. and Mayne Pharma International Pty Ltd. (Mayne) concerning whether our manufacture and sale of Namenda XR, which we acquired in the Forest Acquisition, infringes U.S. Patent No.6,194,000.
Further, in August 2012, Bayer Pharma AG (together with its affiliates, Bayer) filed a complaint against Warner Chilcott alleging that its manufacture, use, offer for sale, and/or sale of Lo Loestrin  Fe infringes Bayers U.S. Patent No.5,980,940. In the complaint, Bayer seeks injunctive relief and unspecified monetary damages for the alleged infringement. In December 2012, Bayer amended the complaint to add a claim seeking to invalidate the Companys U.S. Patent No.7,704,984, which covers the Lo Loestrin  Fe product. Although the parties to patent and intellectual property disputes in the pharmaceutical industry have often settled their disputes through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. Refer to Legal Matters in NOTE 24  Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
35 Table of Contents Furthermore, we cannot be certain that the necessary licenses would be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. As a result, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could result in substantial monetary damage awards and could prevent us from manufacturing and selling a number of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Certain aspects of our operations are highly dependent upon third-party service providers.
We rely on suppliers, vendors and other third-party service providers to research, develop, manufacturing, commercialize, promote and sell our products. Reliance on third-party manufacturers reduces our oversight and control of the manufacturing process. Some of these third-party providers are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, privacy and security risks, and market risks of their own. The failure of a critical third-party service provider to meet its obligations could have a material adverse impact on our operations and results. If any third-party service providers have violated or are alleged to have violated any laws or regulations during the performance of their obligations to us, it is possible that we could suffer financial and reputation harm or other negative outcomes, including possible legal consequences.
In particular, product deliveries within our Anda Distribution business are highly dependent on overnight delivery services to deliver our products in a timely and reliable manner, typically by overnight service. Our Anda Distribution business ships a substantial portion of products via one couriers air and ground delivery service. If the courier terminates our contract or if we cannot renew the contract on favorable terms or enter into a contract with an equally reliable overnight courier to perform and offer the same service level at similar or more favorable rates, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
Our Anda Distribution operations compete directly with significant customers of our generic and brand businesses.
In our Anda Distribution business, we compete with McKesson Corporation (McKesson), AmerisourceBergen Corporation (AmerisourceBergen) and Cardinal Health, Inc. (Cardinal). These companies are significant customers of our North American Brands and North American Generics businesses, including the newly acquired Forest products and collectively accounted for approximately 62%, 29%, 30% of our annual net revenues in the years ended December31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Our activities related to our Anda Distribution business, as well as the acquisition of other businesses that compete with our customers, may result in the disruption of our business, which could harm relationships with our current customers, employees or suppliers, and could adversely affect our expenses, pricing, third-party relationships and revenues. Further, a loss of a significant customer of our North American Brands and North American Generics businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
If we are unable to obtain sufficient supplies from key manufacturing sites or suppliers that in some cases may be the only source of finished products or raw materials, our ability to deliver our products to the market may be impeded.
We are required to identify the supplier(s) of all the raw materials for our products in our applications with the FDA and other regulatory agencies. To the extent practicable, we attempt to identify more than one supplier in each drug application. However, some products and raw materials are available only from a single source and, in many of our drug applications, only one supplier of products and raw materials or site of manufacture has been identified, even in instances where multiple sources exist. Some of these products have historically or may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenues, such as our newly acquired product Namenda  , INFed  , metoprolol succinate extended release tablets, methylphenidate hydrochloride extended release tablets, and a significant number of our oral contraceptive and controlled substance products. In addition, certain manufacturing facilities in Ireland are the exclusive qualified manufacturing facilities for finished dosage forms of many of our products, including our newly acquired products, Namenda  , Bystolic  and Savella  . We expect to continue to rely on our third-party manufacturing partners, such as Ortho-McNeil- Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for methylphenidate ER, Mayne for Doryx  , Contract Pharmaceuticals Limited Canada (CPL) for 36 Table of Contents Estrace  Cream and Norwich Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NPI) for Actonel  and Atelvia  . GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) currently manufactures our Asacol  400 mg product sold in the United Kingdom. CPL, which manufactures our Estrace  Cream product, recently closed its manufacturing facility in Buffalo, New York and transferred its operations at that location to its facilities in Mississauga, Canada. Such transfers are subject to regulatory approvals, and the failure to obtain such approvals in a timely manner may delay production at the new facility and result in an interruption in our product supply. From time to time, certain of our manufacturing sites or outside suppliers have experienced regulatory or supply-related difficulties that have inhibited their ability to deliver products and raw materials to us, causing supply delays or interruptions. The availability and prices of raw materials and supplies are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute materials, currency exchange rates, anticipated or perceived shortages, product contamination, among other factors. To the extent any difficulties experienced by our manufacturing sites or suppliers cannot be resolved or extensions of our key supply agreements cannot be negotiated within a reasonable time and on commercially reasonable terms, or if raw materials for a particular product become unavailable from an approved supplier and we are required to qualify a new supplier with the FDA or other regulatory agency, or if we are unable to do so, our profit margins and market share for the affected product could decrease or be eliminated, as well as delay our development and sales and marketing efforts. Such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Our manufacturing sites outside of the United States and our arrangements with foreign suppliers are subject to certain additional risks, including the availability of government clearances, export duties, political instability, war, acts of terrorism, currency fluctuations and restrictions on the transfer of funds. For example, we obtain a significant portion of our raw materials from foreign suppliers. Arrangements with international raw material suppliers are subject to, among other things, FDA and foreign regulatory body regulation, customs clearances, various import duties and other government clearances, as well as potential shipping delays due to inclement weather, political instability, strikes or other matters outside of our control. Acts of governments outside the U.S. may affect the price or availability of raw materials needed for the development or manufacture of our products. In addition, recent changes in patent laws in jurisdictions outside the U.S. may make it increasingly difficult to obtain raw materials for R&D prior to the expiration of the applicable U.S. or foreign patents.
Our policies regarding returns, allowances and chargebacks, and marketing programs adopted by wholesalers, may reduce our revenues in future fiscal periods.
Consistent with generic industry practice we have liberal return policies and have been willing to give customers post-sale inventory allowances. Under these arrangements, from time to time, we may give our customers credits on our generic products that our customers hold in inventory after we have decreased the market prices of the same generic products. Therefore, if new competitors enter the marketplace and significantly lower the prices of any of their competing products, we may reduce the price of our product. As a result, we may be obligated to provide significant credits to our customers who are then holding inventories of such products, which could reduce sales revenue and gross margin for the period the credit is provided. Like our competitors, we also give credits for chargebacks to wholesale customers that have contracts with us for their sales to hospitals, group purchasing organizations, pharmacies or other retail customers. A chargeback represents an amount payable in the future to a wholesaler for the difference between the invoice price paid to us by our wholesale customer for a particular product and the negotiated price that the wholesalers customer pays for that product. Although we establish reserves based on our prior experience and our best estimates of the impact that these policies may have in subsequent periods, we cannot ensure that our reserves are adequate or that actual product returns, allowances and chargebacks will not exceed our estimates, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and the market price of our stock.
Investigations of the calculation of average wholesale prices may adversely affect our business.
Many government and third-party payers, including Medicare, Medicaid, Health Maintenance Organization (HMOs) and Managed Care Organization (MCOs), have historically reimbursed doctors, pharmacies and others for the purchase of certain prescription drugs based on a drugs average wholesale price (AWP) or 37 Table of Contents wholesale acquisition cost (WAC). In the past several years, state and federal government agencies have conducted ongoing investigations of manufacturers reporting practices with respect to AWP and WAC, in which they have suggested that reporting of inflated AWPs or WACs has led to excessive payments for prescription drugs. For example, beginning in July 2002, we and certain of our subsidiaries, as well as numerous other pharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in various state and federal court actions alleging improper or fraudulent practices related to the reporting of AWP and/or WAC of certain products, and other improper acts, in order to increase prices and market shares. Similarly, Forest is a defendant in four pending state actions alleging that manufacturers reporting of AWP did not correspond to actual provider costs of prescription drugs. Additional actions are possible. These actions, if successful, could adversely affect us and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
The design, development, manufacture and sale of our products involves the risk of product liability claims by consumers and other third parties, and insurance against such potential claims is expensive and may be difficult to obtain.
The design, development, manufacture and sale of our products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and the associated adverse publicity. For example, as of December31, 2014, as a result of our acquisition of Forest we were subject to approximately 200 legal actions asserting product liability claims relating to the use of Celexa  or Lexapro. These cases include claims for wrongful death from suicide or injury from suicide attempts while using Celexa  or Lexapro as well as claims that Celexa  or Lexapro caused various birth defects. While we believe there is no merit to these cases, litigation is inherently subject to uncertainties and we may be required to expend substantial amounts in the defense or resolution of certain of these matters. We regularly monitor the use of our products for trends or increases in reports of adverse events or product complaints, and regularly report such matters to the FDA. In some, but not all cases, an increase in adverse event reports may be an indication that there has been a change in a products specifications or efficacy. Such changes could lead to a recall of the product in question or, in some cases, increases in product liability claims related to the product in question. If the coverage limits for product liability insurance policies are not adequate or if certain of our products are excluded from coverage, a claim brought against us, whether covered by insurance or not, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We also rely on self-insurance to cover product liability claims, and these claims may exceed amounts we have reserved under our self-insurance program.
We are also subject to a variety of other types of claims, proceedings, investigations and litigation initiated by government agencies or third parties. These include compliance matters, product regulation or safety, taxes, employee benefit plans, employment discrimination, health and safety, environmental, antitrust, customs, import/export, government contract compliance, financial controls or reporting, intellectual property, allegations of misrepresentation, false claims or false statements, commercial claims, claims regarding promotion of our products and services, or other similar matters. Any such claims, proceedings, investigations or litigation, regardless of the merits, might result in substantial costs, restrictions on product use or sales, or otherwise injure our business.
The loss of our key personnel could cause our business to suffer.
The success of our present and future operations will depend, to a significant extent, upon the experience, abilities and continued services of key personnel. For example, although we have other senior management personnel, a significant loss of the services of Brent Saunders, our Chief Executive Officer, or Paul Bisaro, our Executive Chairman, or other senior executive officers without having or hiring a suitable successor, could cause our business to suffer. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain key personnel. We have entered into employment agreements with many of our senior executive officers but such agreements do not guarantee that our senior executive officers will remain employed by us for a significant period of time, or at all. We do not carry key-employee life insurance on any of our officers.
Significant balances of intangible assets, including product rights and goodwill acquired, are subject to impairment testing and may result in impairment charges, which will adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
38 Table of Contents A significant amount of our total assets is related to acquired intangibles and goodwill. As of December31, 2014, the carrying value of our product rights and other intangible assets was $19,188.4 million and the carrying value of our goodwill was $24,521.5 million.
Our product rights are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. We determine original fair value and amortization periods for product rights based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows of the acquired products. Such factors include the products position in its life cycle, the existence or absence of like products in the market, various other competitive and regulatory issues and contractual terms. Significant adverse changes to any of these factors would require us to perform an impairment test on the affected asset and, if evidence of impairment exists, we would be required to take an impairment charge with respect to the asset. For assets that are not impaired, the Company may adjust the remaining useful lives. Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Our other significant intangible assets include acquired core technology and customer relationships, which are intangible assets with definite lives, our Anda trade name and acquired IPR&D intangible products, acquired in recent business acquisitions, which are intangible assets with indefinite lives.
Our acquired core technology and customer relationship intangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. We determined the original fair value of our other intangible assets by performing a discounted cash flow analysis, which is based on our assessment of various factors. Such factors include existing operating margins, the number of existing and potential competitors, product pricing patterns, product market share analysis, product approval and launch dates, the effects of competition, customer attrition rates, consolidation within the industry and generic product lifecycle estimates. Our other intangible assets with definite lives are tested for impairment when there are significant changes to any of these factors. If evidence of impairment exists, we would be required to take an impairment charge with respect to the impaired asset. Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Goodwill, our Anda trade name intangible asset and our IPR&D intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or when events occur or circumstances change that could potentially reduce the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset. Impairment testing compares the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset to its carrying amount. A goodwill, trade name or IPR&D impairment, if any, would be recorded in operating income and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For example, in 2013 the Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $647.5 million.
We may need to raise additional funds in the future which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.
We may consider issuing additional debt or equity securities in the future to fund potential acquisitions or investments, to refinance existing debt, or for general corporate purposes. If we issue equity, convertible preferred equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing shareholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing shareholders. If we incur additional debt, it may increase our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization, requiring us to pay additional interest expenses and potentially lowering our credit ratings. We may not be able to market such issuances on favorable terms, or at all, in which case, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements.
Our business could suffer as a result of manufacturing difficulties or delays.
The manufacture of certain of our products and product candidates, particularly our controlled-release products, transdermal products, injectable products, and our oral contraceptive products, is more difficult than the manufacture of immediate-release products. Successful manufacturing of these types of products requires precise manufacturing process controls, API that conforms to very tight tolerances for specific characteristics and equipment that operates consistently within narrow performance ranges. Manufacturing complexity, testing requirements, and safety and security processes combine to increase the overall difficulty of manufacturing these products and resolving manufacturing problems that we may encounter.
39 Table of Contents Our manufacturing and other processes utilize sophisticated equipment, which sometimes require a significant amount of time to obtain and install. Our business could suffer if certain manufacturing or other equipment, or a portion or all of our facilities were to become inoperable for a period of time. This could occur for various reasons, including catastrophic events such as earthquake, monsoon, hurricane or explosion, unexpected equipment failures or delays in obtaining components or replacements thereof, contamination by microorganisms or viruses, labor disputes or shortages, contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers, as well as construction delays or defects and other events, both within and outside of our control. Interruption of our efficient manufacture and supply of products may cause delays in shipments and supply constraints. Our inability to timely manufacture any of our significant products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Our manufacturing processes and those of our third-party contract manufacturers must undergo a potentially lengthy FDA or other regulatory approval process and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It can take longer than five years to build, validate and license a new manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations or if they restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. Because our third-party contract manufacturers and certain of our third-party service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all. If we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products.
Our business will continue to expose us to risks of environmental liabilities.
Our product and API development programs, manufacturing processes and distribution logistics involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and toxic compounds in our owned and leased facilities. As a result, we are subject to numerous and increasingly stringent federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous materials and the discharge of pollutants into the air and water. Our programs and processes expose us to risks that an accidental contamination could result in (i)our noncompliance with such environmental laws and regulations and (ii)regulatory enforcement actions or claims for personal injury and property damage against us. If an accident or environmental discharge occurs, or if we discover contamination caused by prior operations, including by prior owners and operators of properties we acquire, we could be liable for cleanup obligations, damages and fines. The substantial unexpected costs we may incur could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, environmental permits and controls are required for some of our operations, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by the issuing authorities. Any modification, revocation or non-renewal of our environmental permits could have a material adverse effect on our ongoing operations, business and financial condition. Our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations or increased development or manufacturing activities at any of our facilities.
Global economic conditions could harm us.
Recent global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and recession in most major economies during recent years. Continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long-term and wide-spread recession, energy costs, geopolitical issues particularly in areas in which we operate, the availability and cost of credit, and the global real estate markets have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for western and emerging economies. These conditions, combined with volatile oil prices, declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment, have contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels.
40 Table of Contents As a result of these market conditions, the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. Concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers. These factors have resulted in a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike, and a corresponding decrease in global infrastructure spending. Continued turbulence in the U.S. and international markets and economies and prolonged declines in business consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers, including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs.
Global efforts towards health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access. In many international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and patented drugs.
Global economic conditions could adversely affect the ability of third-party distributors, partners, manufacturers and suppliers to obtain liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations.
In particular, some countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of global financial instability or may have very limited resources to spend on healthcare or may be or will be in the future subject to economic sanctions, and our business in these countries may be disproportionately affected by economic changes. In addition, many of these countries have currencies that fluctuate substantially and if such currencies devalue and the Company cannot offset the devaluations, the Companys financial performance within such countries could be adversely affected.
Our foreign operations may become less attractive if political and diplomatic relations between the United States and any country where we conduct business operations deteriorates.
The relationship between the United States and the foreign countries where we conduct business operations may weaken over time. Changes in the state of the relations between any such country and the United States are difficult to predict and could adversely affect our future operations. This could lead to a decline in our profitability. Any meaningful deterioration of the political, economic and diplomatic relations between the United States and the relevant country could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Our global operations, particularly following the Pending Allergan Acquisition, the Actavis Group Acquisition, the Warner Chilcott Acquisition and the Forest Acquisition (including Furiex and Aptalis), expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally.
We operate on a global basis with offices or activities in Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, Australia and North America. We face several risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, economic sanctions, export requirements, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act 2010 and other local laws that prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers. Given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a risk that some provisions may be breached by us, for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements, or otherwise. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these challenges. These factors or any combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue or our overall financial performance. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against 41 Table of Contents us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. Further, certain of our employees, including employees located in certain jurisdictions in Canada, Europe and Asia, are represented by collective bargaining or other labor agreements or arrangements that provide bargaining or other rights to employees. Such employment rights require us to expend greater time and expense in making changes to employees terms of employment or carrying out staff reductions. In addition, any national or other labor disputes in these regions could result in a work stoppage or strike by our employees that could delay or interrupt our ability to supply products and conduct operations. Due to the nature of these collective bargaining agreements, we will have no control over such work stoppages or strikes by such employees, and a strike may occur even if the employees do not have any grievances against us. Any interruption in manufacturing or operations could interfere with our business and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues.
In addition to the foregoing, engaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks, including:  longer payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;  political and economic instability or sanctions in areas in which we operate;  potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, customs charges, bureaucratic requirements and other trade barriers;  regulations related to customs and import/export matters (including sanctions);  tax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws;  challenges in collecting accounts receivable from customers in the jurisdictions in which we operate;  complying with laws, rules and regulations relating to the manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of pharmaceutical products in the jurisdictions in which we do or will operate;  operating under regulations in jurisdictions related to obtaining eligibility for government or private payor reimbursement for our products at the wholesale/retail level;  Competition from local, regional and international competitors;  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations, including cultural and language differences and additional employment regulations, union workforce negotiations and potential disputes in the jurisdictions in which we operate;  difficulties associated with compliance with a variety of laws and regulations governing international trade, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;  difficulties protecting or procuring intellectual property rights; and  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
These factors or any combination of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
We have exposure to tax liabilities.
As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are subject to costs and other potential outcomes from tax audits. The Company believes that its accrual for tax contingencies is adequate for all open years based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued.
42 Table of Contents Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Proposals by the current U.S. administration for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, including without limitation provisions that would limit the ability of U.S. multinationals to deduct interest on related party debt, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate.
We would be adversely affected if, either based on current law or in the event of a change in law, the Internal Revenue Service did not agree that Actavis plc is a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. In addition, future changes to international tax laws not specifically related to inversions could adversely affect us.
Actavis plc believes that, under current law, it is treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, because it is an Irish incorporated entity. However, the IRS may assert that Actavis plc should be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes pursuant to Section7874. Under Section7874, a corporation created or organized outside the United States (i.e., a foreign corporation) will be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes when (i)the foreign corporation directly or indirectly acquires substantially all of the assets held directly or indirectly by a U.S. corporation (including the indirect acquisition of assets of the U.S. corporation by acquiring all the outstanding shares of the U.S. corporation), (ii)the shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation hold at least 80% (by either vote or value) of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation after the acquisition by reason of holding shares in the U.S. acquired corporation (including the receipt of the foreign corporations shares in exchange for the U.S. corporations shares), and (iii)the foreign corporations expanded affiliated group does not have substantial business activities in the foreign corporations country of organization or incorporation relative to such expanded affiliated groups worldwide activities. For purposes of Section7874, multiple acquisitions of U.S. corporations by a foreign corporation, if treated as part of a plan or series of related transactions, may be treated as a single acquisition. If multiple acquisitions of U.S. corporations are treated as a single acquisition, all shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporations would be aggregated for purposes of the test set forth above concerning such shareholders holding at least 80% (by either vote or value) of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation after the acquisitions by reason of holding shares in the acquired U.S. corporations.
Actavis believes that the test set forth above to treat Actavis as a foreign corporation was satisfied in connection with the [acquisition of Actavis, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and Warner Chilcott plc, a company incorporated under the laws of Ireland] (the Warner Chilcott Transaction) on October1, 2013. However, the law and Treasury regulations promulgated under Section7874 are relatively new and somewhat unclear, and thus it cannot be assured that the IRS will agree that the ownership requirements to treat Actavis as a foreign corporation were met. Moreover, even if such ownership requirements were met in the Warner Chilcott Transaction and the subsequent acquisition of all of the common stock of Forest Laboratories Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware (the Forest Transaction), the IRS may assert that, even though the Merger is a separate transaction from the Warner Chilcott Transaction and the Forest Transaction, the Merger should be integrated with the Warner Chilcott Transaction and the Forest Transaction as a single transaction. In the event the IRS were to prevail with such assertion, Actavis would be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes and significant adverse tax consequences would result for Actavis.
In addition, changes to the inversion rules in Section7874 or the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder or other IRS guidance could adversely affect Actavis plcs status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, and any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application to Actavis, Allergan, their respective stockholders, shareholders and affiliates, and/or the Pending Allergan Acquisition. For example, in March 2014, the President of the United States proposed legislation that would amend the anti-inversion rules. In September 2014, the U.S. Treasury and the IRS issued additional guidance stating that they intend to issue regulations that will address certain inversion transactions.
Even if Actavis is respected as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, Actavis might be adversely impacted by recent proposals have aimed to make other changes in the taxation of multinational corporations. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has released proposals to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting. As a result, the tax laws 43 Table of Contents in the United States, Ireland, and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect Actavis and its affiliates (including Allergan and its affiliates after the Pending Allergan Acquisition).
Moreover, U.S. and foreign tax authorities may carefully scrutinize companies that result from cross-border business combination, such as Actavis plc, which may lead such authorities to assert that Actavis plc owes additional taxes.
Foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our business and financial results.
We do business and generate sales in numerous countries outside the United States. The Company has also entered and will continue to enter into acquisition, licensing, borrowing, hedging or other financial transactions that may give rise to currency and interest rate exposure. As such, foreign currency fluctuations may affect the costs that we incur in such international operations. Some of our operating expenses are incurred in non-U.S. dollar currencies. The appreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies in those countries where we have operations against the U.S. dollar could increase our costs and could harm our results of operations and financial condition.
We have incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction, integration and restructuring costs in connection with recent transactions, including the Pending Allergan Acquisition, the Actavis Group Acquisition, the Warner Chilcott Acquisition and the Forest Acquisition.
We have incurred significant transaction costs related to the Pending Allergan Acquisition, the Actavis Group Acquisition, the Warner Chilcott Acquisition and the Forest Acquisition and will continue to incur significant transaction costs related past acquisitions and the Pending Allergan Acquisition. In addition, we will incur integration costs and restructuring costs as we integrate the businesses. While Actavis has assumed that a certain level of transaction and coordination expenses will be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond Actavis control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these transaction and coordination expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. Although we expect that the realization of benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may offset these transaction costs, integration costs and restructuring costs over time, no assurances can be made that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or at all. The failure to realize the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, as a result of acquiring businesses, technologies or products, or entering into other significant transactions, we may experience significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses. These costs may include substantial fees for investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, advisors, consultants and severance and other closure costs associated with regulator-mandated divestitures and the elimination of duplicate or discontinued products, operations and facilities. Charges that we may incur in connection with acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations for particular quarterly or annual periods.
Substantial amounts of our information concerning our products, customers, employees and ongoing business are stored digitally and are subject to threats of theft, tampering, or other intrusion.
We collect and maintain information in digital form that is necessary to conduct our business, and we are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data. This digital information includes, but is not limited to, confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering, and theft. Cyber-attacks are increasing in frequency, sophistication and intensity. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service attacks, worms, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. We have established physical, electronic, and organizational measures to safeguard and secure our systems to prevent a data compromise, and rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for the processing, transmission and storage of digital information. However, the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, the possibility of a future data 44 Table of Contents compromise cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with intrusion, tampering, and theft remain. Data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may pose a risk that data, including intellectual property or personal information, may be exposed to unauthorized individuals or to the public. In addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue our business objectives. While we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where appropriate, monitor the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised. If our data systems are compromised, our business operations may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished, and we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. If personal information of our customers or employees is misappropriated, our reputation with our customers and employees may be injured resulting in loss of business and/or morale, and we may incur costs to remediate possible injury to our customers and employees or be required to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of such incidents.
A failure of our internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business or share price.
The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. An internal control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of the Actavis plc Ordinary Shares.
As of December31, 2013, management concluded that there was a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting as it did not design or maintain effective internal controls with respect to segregation of duties and related information technology general controls regarding user access and change management activities. Specifically, the controls were not designed to provide reasonable assurance that incompatible access within the system, including the ability to record transactions, was appropriately segregated, impacting the validity, accuracy and completeness of all key accounts and disclosures. The locations impacted were principally related to the international entities acquired as part of the Actavis Group in 2012. The Company has remediated the material weaknesses as of December31, 2014.
Risks Relating To Investing In the Pharmaceutical Industry Extensive industry regulation has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business, especially our product development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities.
All pharmaceutical companies, including Actavis, are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving government regulation. For the U.S., this is principally administered by the FDA and to a lesser extent by the DEA and state government agencies, as well as by varying regulatory agencies in foreign countries where products or product candidates are being manufactured and/or marketed. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Controlled Substances Act and other federal statutes and regulations, and similar foreign statutes and regulations, govern or influence the development, testing, manufacturing, packing, labeling, storing, record keeping, safety, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution and import/ export of our products. Foreign regulatory authorities impose similar requirements focused on drug safety and effectiveness. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval has been and will continue to be increasingly difficult, time-consuming and costly. In addition, changes in applicable federal, state and foreign laws and regulations or the implementation of new laws and regulations could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business.
Once regulatory approval has been obtained, agencies continue to have substantial authority to require additional testing, perform inspections, change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products. Failure 45 Table of Contents to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially-imposed sanctions. These sanctions may include, among others, warning letters, fines, civil penalties, criminal penalties, injunctions, debarment, product seizure or detention, product recalls and total or partial suspension of production, sale and promotion. In addition, we may voluntarily elect to recall or restrict the use of a product. Any recall or restriction could divert managerial and financial resources and might harm our reputation.
Under these statutes and regulations, we are subject to periodic inspection of our facilities, procedures and operations and/or the testing of our products by the FDA and similar ex-U.S. authorities, the DEA and other authorities, which conduct periodic inspections to confirm that we are in compliance with all applicable requirements. In addition, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies conduct pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems and processes are in compliance with cGMP and other regulations. Following such inspections, the FDA or other agency may issue observations, notices, citations and/or Warning Letters that could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection. FDA guidelines specify that a Warning Letter is issued only for violations of regulatory significance for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action. We are also required to report adverse events associated with our products to the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Unexpected or serious health or safety concerns would result in product liability claims, labeling changes, recalls, market withdrawals or other regulatory actions, including withdrawal of product approvals. Safety problems can arise as our product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice. We are required to communicate to regulatory agencies adverse events reported to us regarding our products.
Our manufacturing facility in Corona, California is currently subject to a consent decree of permanent injunction. We cannot assure that the FDA will determine we have adequately corrected deficiencies at our Corona manufacturing site, that subsequent FDA inspections at any of our manufacturing sites will not result in additional inspectional observations at such sites, that approval of any of the pending or subsequently submitted NDAs, ANDAs or supplements to such applications by Actavis plc or our subsidiaries will be granted or that the FDA will not seek to impose additional sanctions against Actavis plc or any of its subsidiaries. The range of possible sanctions includes, among others, FDA issuance of adverse publicity, product recalls or seizures, fines, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDAs review of product applications, enforcement actions, injunctions, and civil or criminal prosecution. Any such sanctions, if imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Under certain circumstances, the FDA also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals. Similar sanctions as detailed above may be available to the FDA under a consent decree, depending upon the actual terms of such decree. Although we have instituted internal compliance programs, if these programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way, it could materially harm our business. Certain of our vendors are subject to similar regulation and periodic inspections and may be operating under consent decrees.
In order to market our products in the United States and other jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The process for obtaining governmental approval to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products is rigorous, time-consuming, uncertain and costly, and we cannot predict the extent to which we may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments. We are dependent on receiving FDA and other governmental or third-party approvals prior to manufacturing, marketing and shipping our products. There is always the chance that we will not obtain FDA or other necessary approvals, or that the rate, timing and cost of obtaining such approvals, will adversely affect our product introduction plans or results of operations. Additionally, any regulatory approvals we receive may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval or may contain requirements for potentially costly additional clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product. We may only market or promote our products for their approved indications, and our labeling, promotional activities and advertising are subject to extensive regulation and oversight. We carry inventories of certain product(s) in anticipation of launch, and if such product(s) are not subsequently launched, we may be required to write-off the related inventory.
46 Table of Contents Our Anda Distribution operations and our customers are subject to various regulatory requirements, including requirements of the DEA, FDA, state boards of pharmacy and city and county health regulators, among others. These include licensing, registration, recordkeeping, security and reporting requirements. The DEA requires our Anda Distribution business to monitor customer orders of DEA Scheduled Drugs and to report suspicious orders to the DEA. Any determination by the DEA that we have failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in DEA suspending, terminating or refusing to renew Anda Distributions license to distribute Scheduled Drugs. Additionally, although physicians may prescribe FDA approved products for an off label indication, we are permitted to market our products only for the indications for which they have been approved. Some of our products are prescribed off label and the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney or other regulatory authorities could take enforcement actions if they conclude that we or our distributors have engaged in off label marketing. In addition, several states and the federal government have begun to enforce anti-counterfeit drug pedigree laws which require the tracking of all transactions involving prescription drugs beginning with the manufacturer, through the supply chain, and down to the pharmacy or other health care provider dispensing or administering prescription drug products. For example, effective July1, 2006, the Florida Department of Health began enforcement of the drug pedigree requirements for distribution of prescription drugs in the State of Florida. Pursuant to Florida law and regulations, wholesalers and distributors, including our subsidiary, Anda Pharmaceuticals, are required to maintain records documenting the chain of custody of prescription drug products they distribute beginning with the purchase of products from the manufacturer. These entities are required to provide documentation of the prior transaction(s) to their customers in Florida, including pharmacies and other health care entities. Several other states have proposed or enacted legislation to implement similar or more stringent drug pedigree requirements. In addition, federal law requires that a non-authorized distributor of record must provide a drug pedigree documenting the prior purchase of a prescription drug from the manufacturer or from an authorized distributor of record. In cases where the wholesaler or distributor selling the drug product is not deemed an authorized distributor of record it would need to maintain such records. The FDA had announced its intent to impose additional drug pedigree requirements (e.g., tracking of lot numbers and documentation of all transactions) through implementation of drug pedigree regulations which were to have taken effect on December1, 2006. However, a federal appeals court has issued a preliminary injunction to several wholesale distributors granting an indefinite stay of these regulations pending a challenge to the regulations by these wholesale distributors.
In addition to government agencies that promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us, other professional societies, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians, private health or science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, and patient communities. For example, the treatment practices of physicians that currently prescribe our products may change. Recommendations by government agencies or other groups and organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies, as well as reimbursement of our products by government and private payers. Any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results.
The supply of APIs into Europe may be negatively affected by recent regulations promulgated by the European Union.
As of July2, 2013, all APIs imported into the EU must be certified as complying with the good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards established by the EU, as stipulated by the International Conference for Harmonization. These new regulations place the certification requirement on the regulatory bodies of the exporting countries. Accordingly, as of July2, 2013, the national regulatory authorities of each exporting country must: (i)insure that all manufacturing plants within their borders that export API into the EU comply with EU manufacturing standards and; (ii)for each API exported, present a written document confirming that the exporting plant conforms to EU manufacturing standards. The imposition of this responsibility on the governments of the nations exporting API may cause a shortage of API necessary to manufacture our products, as certain governments may not be willing or able to comply with the regulation in a timely fashion, or at all. A shortage in API may cause us to have to cease manufacture of certain products, or to incur costs and delays to qualify other suppliers to substitute for those API manufacturers unable to export. This could adversely affect the 47 Table of Contents Company and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
Federal regulation of arrangements between manufacturers of brand and generic products could adversely affect our business.
As part of the MMA, companies are required to file with the FTC and the Department of Justice certain types of agreements entered into between brand and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture, marketing and sale of generic versions of brand drugs. This requirement, as well as new legislation pending in the U.S. Congress related to settlements between brand and generic drug manufacturers, could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with brand pharmaceutical companies and could result generally in an increase in private-party litigation against pharmaceutical companies or additional investigations or proceedings by the FTC or other governmental authorities. The impact of this requirement, the pending legislation and the potential private-party lawsuits associated with arrangements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers, is uncertain and could adversely affect our business. For example, on April5, 2013, two putative class actions were filed against Actavis, Inc. and certain affiliates alleging that Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s 2009 patent lawsuit settlement with Warner Chilcott related to Loestrin  24 Fe (norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets, Loestrin  24) is unlawful. The complaints, both asserted on behalf of putative classes of end-payors, generally allege that Watson and another generic manufacturer improperly delayed launching generic versions of Loestrin  24 in exchange for substantial payments from Warner Chilcott, which at the time was an unrelated company, in violation of federal and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. Further, in January 2009, the FTC and the State of California filed a lawsuit against us alleging that our settlement with Solvay related to our ANDA for a generic version of Androgel  is unlawful. Numerous private parties purporting to represent various classes of plaintiffs filed similar lawsuits. Similar lawsuits have been filed against us challenging the lawfulness of our settlements related to generic versions of Actos  , Androgel  , Cipro  , and Lidoderm  . We have also received requests for information and Statements of Objection in connection with investigations into settlements and other arrangements between competing pharmaceutical companies by the Federal Trade Commission and the European Competition Commission. In the past, we have also received requests for information and Statements of Objection in connection with investigations into settlements and other arrangements between competing pharmaceutical companies by the Federal Trade Commission and the European Competition Commission. In May 2014, Forest received a Civil Investigatory Demand from the FTC requesting information about Forests agreements with ANDA filers for Bystolic  . In February 2014, Forest received an Investigatory Subpoena from the New York Attorney Generals Office requesting information regarding, among other things, plans to discontinue the sale of Namenda tablets. Any adverse outcome of these actions or investigations, or actions or investigations related to other settlements we have entered into, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Refer to Legal Matters in NOTE 24  Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Healthcare reform and a reduction in the coverage and reimbursement levels by governmental authorities, HMOs, MCOs or other third-party payers may adversely affect our business.
Demand for our products depends in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement is available from third-party payers, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs and private payors. In order to commercialize our products, we have obtained from government authorities and private health insurers and other organizations, such as HMOs and MCOs, recognition for coverage and reimbursement at varying levels for the cost of certain of our products and related treatments. Third-party payers increasingly challenge pricing of pharmaceutical products. Further, the trend toward managed healthcare in the U.S., the growth of organizations such as HMOs and MCOs and legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs create uncertainties regarding the future levels of coverage and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products. Such cost containment measures and healthcare reform could reduce reimbursement of our pharmaceutical products, resulting in lower prices and a reduction in the product demand. This could affect our ability to sell our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
48 Table of Contents There is uncertainty surrounding implementation of legislation involving payments for pharmaceuticals under government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare. Depending on how existing provisions are implemented, the methodology for certain payment rates and other computations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program reimbursements may be reduced or not be available for some of our products. Additionally, any reimbursement granted may not be maintained or limits on reimbursement available from third-party payers may reduce demand for, or negatively affect the price of, those products. Ongoing uncertainty and challenges to the ACA, including but not limited to, modification in calculation of rebates, mandated financial or other contributions to close the Medicare Part D coverage gap donut hole, calculation of AMP, and other provisions could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, various legislative and regulatory initiatives in states, including proposed modifications to reimbursements and rebates, product pedigree and tracking, pharmaceutical waste take-back initiatives, and therapeutic category generic substitution carve-out legislation may also have a negative impact on the Company. We maintain a full-time government affairs department in Washington, DC, which is responsible for coordinating state and federal legislative activities, and places a major emphasis in terms of management time and resources to ensure a fair and balanced legislative and regulatory arena.
There is additional uncertainty surrounding the insurance coverage mandate that goes into effect in the U.S. in 2015 and 2016. Employers may seek to reduce costs by reducing or eliminating employer group healthcare plans or transferring a greater portion of healthcare costs ot their employees. Job losses or other economic hardships may also result in reduced levels of coverage for some individuals, potentially resulting in lower levels of healthcare coverage for themselves or their families. These economic conditions may affect patients ability to afford health care as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to changes in patient behavior and spending patterns that negatively affect usage of certain of our products, including some patients delaying treatment, rationing prescription medications, leaving prescriptions unfilled, reducing the frequency of visits to healthcare facilities, utilizing alternative therapies, or foregoing healthcare insurance coverage. Such changes may result in reduced demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect the sales of our products, our business and results of operations.
The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and our future revenue growth and profitability are dependent on our timely development and launches of new products ahead of our competitors.
We face strong competition in all of our businesses. The intensely competitive environment requires an ongoing, extensive search for technological innovations and the ability to market products effectively, including the ability to communicate the effectiveness, safety and value of brand products to healthcare professionals in private practice, group practices and MCOs. Our competitors vary depending upon product categories, and within each product category, upon dosage strengths and drug-delivery systems. Based on total assets, annual revenues, and market capitalization, we are smaller than certain of our national and international competitors in the brand and distribution product arenas. Most of our competitors have been in business for a longer period of time than us, have a greater number of products on the market and have greater financial and other resources than we do. Furthermore, recent trends in this industry are toward further market consolidation of large drug companies into a smaller number of very large entities, further concentrating financial, technical and market strength and increasing competitive pressure in the industry. If we directly compete with them for the same markets and/or products, their financial strength could prevent us from capturing a profitable share of those markets. It is possible that developments by our competitors will make our products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete. In addition, competitive forces may result in changes to the mix of products that we sell during a given time period or lower demand for our products than expected.
Some of our competitors have technical, competitive or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes. We face increased competition from new infection prevention, sterile processing, contamination control, surgical support, cleaning consumables, gastrointestinal endoscopy accessories, contract sterilization, and other products and services entering the market. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to 49 Table of Contents compete with new products that these competitors may bring to market. As a result, our products may compete against products that have lower prices, equivalent or superior performance, a better safety profile, are easier to administer, achieve earlier entry into the market or that are otherwise competitive with our products.
Revenues and gross profit derived from the sales of generic pharmaceutical products tend to follow a pattern based on certain regulatory and competitive factors. As patents for brand name products and related exclusivity periods expire, the first generic manufacturer to receive regulatory approval for generic equivalents of such products is generally able to achieve significant market penetration. Therefore, our ability to increase or maintain revenues and profitability in our generics business is largely dependent on our success in challenging patents and developing non-infringing formulations of proprietary products. As competing manufacturers receive regulatory approvals on similar products or as brand manufacturers launch generic versions of such products (for which no separate regulatory approval is required), market share, revenues and gross profit typically decline, in some cases dramatically. Accordingly, the level of market share, revenue and gross profit attributable to a particular generic product normally is related to the number of competitors in that products market and the timing of that products regulatory approval and launch, in relation to competing approvals and launches. Consequently, we must continue to develop and introduce new products in a timely and cost-effective manner to maintain our revenues and gross margins. We may have fewer opportunities to launch significant generic products in the future, as the number and size of proprietary products that are subject to patent challenges is expected to decrease in the next several years compared to historical levels. Additionally, as new competitors enter the market, there may be increased pricing pressure on certain products, which would result in lower gross margins. This is particularly true in the case of certain Asian and other overseas generic competitors, who may be able to produce products at costs lower than the costs of domestic manufacturers. If we experience substantial competition from Asian or other overseas generic competitors with lower production costs, our profit margins will suffer.
We also face strong competition in our Anda Distribution business, where we compete with a number of large wholesalers and other distributors of pharmaceuticals, including McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal, which market both brand and generic pharmaceutical products to their customers. These companies are significant customers of our North American Brands and North American Generics businesses. As generic products generally have higher gross margins for distributors, each of the large wholesalers, on an increasing basis, are offering pricing incentives on brand products if the customers purchase a large portion of their generic pharmaceutical products from the primary wholesaler. As Anda does not offer a full line of brand products to our customers, we have been at times competitively disadvantaged and must compete with these wholesalers based upon our very competitive pricing for generic products, greater service levels and our well-established telemarketing relationships with our customers, supplemented by our electronic ordering capabilities. The large wholesalers have historically not used telemarketers to sell to their customers, but recently have begun to do so. Additionally, generic manufacturers are increasingly marketing their products directly to smaller chains and thus increasingly bypassing wholesalers and distributors. Increased competition in the generic industry as a whole may result in increased price erosion in the pursuit of market share.
Sales of our products may continue to be adversely affected by the continuing consolidation of our distribution network and the concentration of our customer base.
Our principal customers in our brand and generic pharmaceutical operations are wholesale drug distributors and major retail drug store chains. These customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the U.S. This distribution network is continuing to undergo significant consolidation marked by mergers and acquisitions among wholesale distributors and the growth of large retail drug store chains. As a result, a small number of large wholesale distributors and large chain drug stores control a significant share of the market. We expect that consolidation of drug wholesalers and retailers will increase pricing and other competitive pressures on drug manufacturers, including the Company.
The loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, none of our customers are party to any long-term supply agreements with us, and thus are able to change suppliers freely should they wish to do so.
50 Table of Contents We might face additional regulation in the U.S. if our drug candidate eluxadoline, which we acquired in the Furiex acquisition, is classified as a controlled substance by the DEA; we may be required to make additional payments in connection with the Furiex acquisition based on the outcome of any DEA schedule decision with respect to eluxadoline.
The DEA regulates drugs that are controlled substances. Controlled substances are those drugs that appear on one of the five schedules promulgated and administered by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act (the CSA). Any drug that acts on the central nervous system has the potential to become a controlled substance, and scheduling by the DEA is an independent process that might delay the commercial launch of a drug even after FDA approval of the NDA. The CSA governs, among other things, the inventory distribution, recordkeeping, handling, security and disposal of controlled substances.
Eluxadoline is a novel, orally active, investigational agent that was filed with the FDA, with combined mu opioid receptor agonist and delta opioid receptor antagonist activity. Because it likely acts on the central nervous system, eluxadoline has the potential to be scheduled as a controlled substance by the DEA. However, our animal and clinical studies indicate eluxadoline is not absorbed into the blood in an appreciable amount via an oral route of administration, thus limiting delivery to the central nervous system. If the DEA schedules eluxadoline as a controlled substance, we will be subject to periodic and on-going inspections by the DEA and similar state drug enforcement authorities to assess our on-going compliance with the DEAs regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could lead to a variety of sanctions, including the revocation, or a denial of renewal, of any DEA registrations, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties. Additionally, if the DEA schedules a drug because it is addictive, doctors might be reluctant to prescribe that drug. It is possible that the DEA will schedule eluxadoline as a controlled substance, and, based on the type of scheduling, doctors might not prescribe eluxadoline as frequently as they would otherwise, which could negatively impact our revenues.
In addition, under the terms of the agreements we entered into at the time of the Furiex acquisition, we may be required to make contingent payments to the former Furiex shareholders based on the outcome of any DEA scheduling decision with respect to eluxadoline. These payments would be approximately $120.0 million, in the aggregate, if eluxadoline is designated on Schedule IV of the CSA and would increase up to $360.0 million, in the aggregate, if eluxadoline is not designated on any schedule of the CSA.
Developments after a product reaches the market may adversely affect sales of our products.
Even after regulatory approval, certain developments may decrease demand for our products, including the following:  the re-review of products that are already marketed;  new scientific information and evolution of scientific theories;  the recall or loss of marketing approval of products that are already marketed;  changing government standards or public expectations regarding safety, efficacy or labeling changes; and  greater scrutiny in advertising and promotion.
In the past, clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs of the Company and of competitors within the industry have raised concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products. If previously unknown side effects are discovered or if there is an increase in negative publicity regarding known side effects of any of our products, it could significantly reduce demand for the product or require us to take actions that could negatively affect sales, including removing the product from the market, restricting its distribution or applying for labeling changes.
In addition, certain health authorities, regulators and agencies have increased their focus on safety when assessing the balance of benefits and risks of drugs. Some health authorities appear to have become more cautious when making decisions about approvability of new products and are re-reviewing select products that are already marketed, adding further to the uncertainties in the regulatory processes. There is also greater regulatory scrutiny, especially in the U.S., on advertising and promotion and, in particular, direct-to-consumer advertising.
51 Table of Contents Additional Risks Related to the Warner Chilcott Acquisition and Re-domiciliation of Actavis to Ireland We are seeking Irish High Court approval of the creation of distributable reserves. We expect this will be forthcoming but cannot guarantee this.
Under Irish law, dividends may only be paid and share repurchases and redemptions must generally be funded only out of distributable reserves. Distributable reserves generally means our accumulated realized profits less our accumulated realized losses and also includes reserves created by way of a reduction of capital, determined by reference to our most recent unconsolidated accounts laid before shareholders at our annual general meeting. In addition, under Irish law, we cannot make any distribution or dividend unless our net assets are equal to, or in excess of, the aggregate of our called up share capital plus undistributable reserves and the distribution does not reduce our net assets below such aggregate. Undistributable reserves include our share premium account and the amount by which our accumulated unrealized profits, so far as not previously utilized by any capitalization, exceed our accumulated unrealized losses, so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of our capital. While we do not currently have distributable reserves we have filed a petition with the Irish High Court to confirm the creation of distributable reserves by reducing the share premium created by the issuance of ordinary shares in connection with the Warner Chilcott acquisition. The approval of the Irish High Court is expected late in the first quarter of 2015 or early in the second quarter of 2015. We are not aware of any reason why the Irish High Court would not approve the creation of distributable reserves; however, the issuance of the required order is a matter for the discretion of the Irish High Court. In the event that distributable reserves are not created, no distributions by way of dividends, share repurchases or otherwise will be permitted under Irish law until such time as the Company has created sufficient distributable reserves from its trading activities.
As a result of different shareholder voting requirements in Ireland relative to laws in effect in certain states in the United States, we may have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management than companies organized in the United States.
Under Irish law, our authorized share capital can be increased by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders and the directors may issue new ordinary or preferred shares up to a maximum amount equal to the authorized but unissued share capital, without shareholder approval, once authorized to do so by our articles of association or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Irish law grants statutory preemption rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash, but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of the statutory preemption rights by way of special resolution with respect to any particular allotment of shares. Accordingly, our articles of association contain, as permitted by Irish company law, a provision authorizing the board to issue new shares for cash without offering preemption rights. The authorization of the directors to issue shares and the authorization of the waiver of the statutory preemption rights must both be renewed by the shareholders at least every five years, and we cannot provide any assurance that these authorizations will always be approved, which could limit our ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holders of our securities.
We are incorporated in Ireland, and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to, or otherwise adversely affect, our shareholders.
Our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. As an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Acts (the Companies Act). The Companies Act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers, amalgamations and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors. For example, under Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only. As a result, shareholders of Irish companies do not have the right to bring an action against the directors or officers of a company, except in limited circumstances. In addition, depending on the circumstances, you may be subject to different or additional tax consequences under Irish law as a result of your acquisition, ownership and/or disposition of our ordinary shares, including, but not limited to, Irish stamp duty, dividend withholding tax and capital acquisitions tax.
52 Table of Contents We are an Irish company and it may be difficult for you to enforce judgments against us or certain of our officers and directors.
We are incorporated in Ireland and a substantial portion of our assets are located in jurisdictions outside the United States. In addition, some of our officers and directors reside outside the United States, and some or all of their respective assets are or may be located in jurisdictions outside of the United States. Therefore, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process against us or such officers or directors or to enforce against us or them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.
There is no treaty between Ireland and the United States providing for the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments. The following requirements must be met before the foreign judgment will be deemed to be enforceable in Ireland:  the judgment must be for a definite sum;  the judgment must be final and conclusive; and  the judgment must be provided by a court of competent jurisdiction.
An Irish court will also exercise its right to refuse judgment if the foreign judgment was obtained by fraud, if the judgment violated Irish public policy, if the judgment is in breach of natural justice or if it is irreconcilable with an earlier judgment. Further, an Irish court may stay proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. Judgments of U.S. courts of liabilities predicated upon U.S. federal securities laws may not be enforced by Irish courts if deemed to be contrary to public policy in Ireland.
A transfer of Company Ordinary Shares, other than by means of the transfer of book-entry interests in the Depository Trust Company (DTC), may be subject to Irish stamp duty.
Transfers of Company Ordinary Shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in DTC will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. However, if you hold your Company Ordinary Shares directly rather than beneficially through DTC, any transfer of your Company Ordinary Shares could be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired). Payment of Irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee. The potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of your shares.
In certain limited circumstances, dividends we pay may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax.
While we do not currently contemplate paying dividends upon our ordinary shares, in certain limited circumstances, dividend withholding tax (currently at a rate of 20%) may arise in respect of dividends, if any, paid on our ordinary shares. A number of exemptions from dividend withholding tax exist such that shareholders resident in the U.S. and shareholders resident in certain countries may be entitled to exemptions from dividend withholding tax.
Shareholders resident in the U.S. that hold their shares through DTC will not be subject to dividend withholding tax provided the addresses of the beneficial owners of such shares in the records of the brokers holding such shares are recorded as being in the U.S. (and such brokers have further transmitted the relevant information to a qualifying intermediary appointed by us). Similarly, shareholders resident in the U.S. that hold their shares outside of DTC will not be subject to dividend withholding tax if, in the case of former Actavis, Inc. shareholders, they provide a IRS Form 6166 to our transfer agent to confirm their U.S. residence and claim an exemption, or, in the case of former Warner Chilcott shareholders, such shareholders previously filed valid dividend withholding tax forms with Warner Chilcott or its transfer agent in respect of their Warner Chilcott shareholdings. All new U.S. resident shareholders in Actavis plc that hold their shares outside of DTC and shareholders resident in certain other countries (irrespective of whether they hold their shares through DTC or outside DTC) will not be subject to dividend withholding tax provided the beneficial owners of such shares have furnished completed and valid dividend withholding tax forms or an IRS Form 6166, as appropriate, to our transfer agent or their brokers (and such brokers have further transmitted the relevant information to our transfer agent). However, other shareholders may be subject to dividend withholding tax, which could adversely affect the price of your shares.
53 Table of Contents Dividends received by Irish residents and certain other shareholders may be subject to Irish income tax.
Shareholders entitled to an exemption from Irish dividend withholding tax on dividends received from us will not be subject to Irish income tax in respect of those dividends, unless they have some connection with Ireland other than their shareholding in us (for example, they are resident in Ireland). Shareholders who are not resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland but who are not entitled to an exemption from Irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to Irish income tax on those dividends which suffer dividend withholding tax.
Company Ordinary Shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to Irish capital acquisitions tax.
Irish capital acquisitions tax (CAT) could apply to a gift or inheritance of Company Ordinary Shares irrespective of the place of residence, ordinary residence or domicile of the parties. This is because Company Ordinary Shares are regarded as property situated in Ireland. The person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for CAT. Gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from CAT. Children have a tax-free threshold of 225,000 in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents.
Risks Associated with the Pending Allergan Acquisition The market price for Actavis ordinary shares following the closing of the Pending Allergan Acquisition may be affected by factors different from those that historically have affected or currently affect Allergan common stock and Actavis ordinary shares.
Upon completion of the Pending Allergan Acquisition, holders of shares of Allergan common stock (other than the holders of excluded shares and dissenting shares) will become holders of Actavis ordinary shares. Actavis businesses differ from those of Allergan, and accordingly the results of operations of Actavis will be affected by some factors that are different from those currently affecting the results of operations of Allergan. In addition, upon completion of the Pending Allergan Acquisition, holders of Actavis ordinary shares will become holders of shares in the combined company. The results of operation of the combined company may also be affected by factors different from those currently affecting Actavis.
Actavis and Allergan must obtain required approvals and governmental and regulatory consents to consummate the Pending Allergan Acquisition, which if delayed or not granted or granted with unacceptable conditions, may prevent (for example, if the approval of Actavis shareholders or Allergan stockholders is not obtained), delay or jeopardize the consummation of the Pending Allergan Acquisition, result in additional expenditures of money and resources and/or reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger.
The Pending Allergan Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions. These closing conditions include, among others, the receipt of required approvals by the Actavis shareholders and the Allergan stockholders, the clearances of the Pending Allergan Acquisition by certain governmental and regulatory authorities, including multiple governmental and regulatory authorities, and the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act (for which early termination was granted on January9, 2015), and the antitrust and competition laws of certain foreign countries under which filings or approvals are or may be required. The governmental agencies with which the parties will make these filings and seek certain of these approvals and consents have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations. Actavis and Allergan can provide no assurance that all required approvals and consents will be obtained. Moreover, as a condition to their approval of the transaction, certain governmental agencies may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the business of the combined company after the closing of the Pending Allergan Acquisition. Any one of these requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could jeopardize or delay the effective time of the Pending Allergan Acquisition or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction. Further, no assurance can be given that the required Actavis shareholder and Allergan stockholder approvals will be obtained or that the required closing conditions will be satisfied, and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and the closing conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be 54 Table of Contents given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the approvals or clearances. If Actavis and Allergan agree to any material requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions in order to obtain any approvals or clearances required to consummate the transaction, these requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could adversely affect Actavis ability to integrate Allergans operations with Actavis operations and/or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transactions. This could result in a failure to consummate the transactions or have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the combined company.
The Allergan Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Pending Allergan Acquisition may not be completed.
The Allergan Merger Agreement contains a number of conditions that must be fulfilled to complete the Pending Allergan Acquisition. Those conditions include: the approval of the merger proposal by Allergan stockholders, approval of the Actavis share issuance proposal by Actavis shareholders, receipt of requisite regulatory and antitrust approvals, absence of orders prohibiting the closing of the merger, effectiveness of the registration statement , approval of the Actavis ordinary shares to be issued to Allergan stockholders for listing on the NYSE, the continued accuracy of the representations and warranties of both parties subject to specified materiality standards, the performance by both parties of their covenants and agreements and that, since the date of the Allergan Merger Agreement, no material adverse effect of Allergan or Actavis has occurred and is continuing. These conditions to the closing of the Pending Allergan Acquisition may not be fulfilled and, accordingly, the Pending Allergan Acquisition may not be completed. In addition, if the Pending Allergan Acquisition is not completed by September30, 2015 (subject to extension to November16, 2015, if the only conditions not satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the Pending Allergan Acquisition, which conditions are capable of being satisfied) are conditions relating to certain required filings and clearances under antitrust laws, the absence of certain proceedings under certain antitrust laws and the absence of any orders, judgments or decrees under certain antitrust laws), either Actavis or Allergan may choose not to proceed with the Pending Allergan Acquisition. In addition, Actavis or Allergan may elect to terminate the Allergan Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Allergan Merger Agreement at any time prior to the consummation of the Pending Allergan Acquisition, whether before or after Allergan stockholder approval or Actavis shareholder approval.
The Allergan Merger Agreement contains provisions that restrict the ability of the Actavis board of directors to change its recommendation that Actavis shareholders vote for the approval of the Actavis share issuance proposal and, in specified circumstances, could require Actavis to pay Allergan a termination fee of up to $2.1 billion.
Under the Allergan Merger Agreement, the Actavis board of directors is restricted, subject to certain exceptions, from withdrawing, changing, amending, modifying or qualifying, or otherwise proposing publicly to withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Allergan, its recommendation that Actavis shareholders vote for the approval of the Actavis share issuance proposal. If the Actavis board of directors (after consultation with Actavis legal counsel) determines that an Actavis change of recommendation is advisable and effects such a change of recommendation, Allergan would be entitled to terminate the Allergan Merger Agreement. Under such circumstances, Actavis would be required to pay Allergan a termination fee equal to $2.1 billion. In the event the Allergan Merger Agreement is terminated due to the failure of the Actavis shareholders to approve the Actavis share issuance proposal at the Actavis extraordinary general meeting, Actavis would be required to pay Allergan a termination fee of $1.3 billion.
While the merger is pending, Actavis and Allergan will be subject to business uncertainties that could adversely affect their business.
Uncertainty about the effect of the Pending Allergan Acquisition on employees, customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect on Allergan and Actavis. These uncertainties may impair Actavis and Allergans ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is consummated and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others who deal with Actavis and Allergan to seek to change 55 Table of Contents existing business relationships with Actavis and Allergan. Employee retention may be challenging during the pendency of the merger, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. If key employees depart because of issues related to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the businesses, the business of the combined company following the Pending Allergan Acquisition could be seriously harmed. In addition, the Allergan Merger Agreement restricts Allergan and, to a lesser extent, Actavis, from taking specified actions until the merger occurs without the consent of the other party. These restrictions may prevent Actavis or Allergan from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger.
Risks Related to the Business of the Combined Company Actavis may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Pending Allergan Acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. Actavis may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the two businesses.
The ability of Actavis to realize the anticipated benefits of the Pending Allergan Acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on Actavis ability to integrate the two businesses. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, Actavis and Allergan will be required to devote significant management attention and resources prior to closing to prepare for integrating, and Actavis will be required to devote significant management attention and resources post-closing to integrate, the business practices and operations of Actavis and Allergan. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, would restrict the realization of the full expected benefits. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the combined company and could adversely affect the results of operations of the combined company.
In addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer and other business relationships, and diversion of managements attention. Refer to If we do not successfully integrate newly acquired businesses into our business operations, our business could be adversely affected .
Many of these factors will be outside of the control of Actavis or Allergan and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy, which could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company. In addition, even if the operations of the businesses of Actavis and Allergan are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the transactions may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are expected. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of Actavis and Allergan. All of these factors could cause dilution to the earnings per share of Actavis, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transactions, and negatively impact the price of Actavis ordinary shares. As a result, it cannot be assured that the combination of Actavis and Allergan will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transactions.
Actavis and Allergan will incur direct and indirect costs as a result of the Pending Allergan Acquisition.
Actavis and Allergan will incur substantial expenses in connection with and as a result of completing the merger and, over a period of time following the completion of the merger, Actavis further expects to incur substantial expenses in connection with coordinating the businesses, operations, policies and procedures of Actavis and Allergan. While Actavis has assumed that a certain level of transaction expenses will be incurred, factors beyond Actavis control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately.
56 Table of Contents If the merger is consummated, Actavis will incur a substantial amount of debt to finance the aggregate Cash Consideration Portion and certain other amounts to be paid in connection with the Pending Allergan Acquisition, which could adversely affect Actavis business, including by restricting its ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness or resulting in a downgrade or other adverse action with respect to Actavis credit rating.
In connection with the Pending Allergan Acquisition, Actavis expects that one or more of its subsidiaries will (i)borrow up to $5.5 billion under the Term Facilities, (ii)issue and sell up to $22.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of notes, (iii)under certain circumstances, borrow up to $4.698 billion in loans under the cash bridge facility and (iv)if and to the extent the notes or the equity securities are not issued and sold, borrow up to $30.9 billion in loans under the Bridge Credit Agreement. Following the completion of the merger, the combined company will have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding. On a pro forma basis, giving effect to the incurrence of indebtedness, the consolidated indebtedness of Actavis would be approximately $45.2billion as of December31, 2014. Actavis net consolidated borrowing costs, which cannot be predicted at this time, will depend on rates in effect from time to time, the structure of the indebtedness, taxes and other factors. This substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to Actavis business, including, but not limited to:  reducing the benefits Actavis expects to receive from the Pending Allergan Acquisition;  making it more difficult for Actavis to satisfy its obligations;  limiting Actavis ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing;  increasing Actavis vulnerability to, and reducing its flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions;  limiting Actavis flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which it operates;  placing Actavis at a competitive disadvantage as compared to its competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged; and  restricting Actavis from pursuing certain business opportunities.
Actavis credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, Actavis cost of capital. Actavis ratings at any time will reflect each rating organizations then opinion of Actavis financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet its debt obligations. Following the announcement of the Pending Allergan Acquisition, Standard& Poors Rating Services, Moodys Investor Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Inc. each reaffirmed its respective ratings of Actavis. However, there can be no assurance that Actavis will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future. Any reduction in Actavis credit ratings may limit Actavis ability to borrow at interest rates consistent with the interest rates that have been available to Actavis prior to the Pending Allergan Acquisition. If Actavis credit ratings are downgraded or put on watch for a potential downgrade, Actavis may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in the amounts, at the times or interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if Actavis current credit ratings are maintained. Any impairment of Actavis ability to obtain future financing on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on Actavis ability to refinance the Bridge Credit Agreement, if drawn, with the issuance of debt securities or alternatives to the Bridge Credit Agreement on terms more favorable than under the Bridge Credit Agreement, or to refinance, to the extent the cash bridge facility is not otherwise repaid using Allergans cash on hand, the cash bridge facility.
Actavis expects that, for a period of time following the consummation of the merger, Actavis will have significantly less cash on hand than the sum of cash on hand of Actavis and Allergan prior to the Pending Allergan Acquisition. This reduced amount of cash could adversely affect Actavis ability to grow.
Actavis is expected to have, for a period of time following the consummation of the merger, significantly less cash and cash equivalents on hand than the approximately $5.16 billion of combined cash and cash equivalents of the two companies as of December 31, 2014, and would have on a pro forma basis, giving effect to 57 Table of Contents the Pending Allergan Acquisition as if they had been consummated on December 31, 2014, $1.9billion of cash and cash equivalents. Although the management of Actavis believes that it will have access to cash sufficient to meet Actavis business objectives and capital needs, the lessened availability of cash and cash equivalents for a period of time following the consummation of the Pending Allergan Acquisition could constrain Actavis ability to grow its business. Actavis more leveraged financial position following the Pending Allergan Acquisition could also make it vulnerable to general economic downturns and industry conditions, and place it at a competitive disadvantage relative to its competitors that have more cash at their disposal. In the event that Actavis does not have adequate capital to maintain or develop its business, additional capital may not be available to Actavis on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all.
Disruption in the financial markets could affect Actavis ability to refinance the bridge loan facilities on favorable terms, or at all.
If and to the extent drawn, the $30.9 billion Bridge Credit Agreement must be repaid within 364 days after the consummation of the Pending Allergan Acquisition and, if the $4.698 billion cash bridge facility is necessary, the cash bridge facility must be repaid within 60 days after the consummation of the Pending Allergan Acquisition. Actavis anticipates refinancing, or obtaining alternative financing to repay, the Bridge Credit Agreement and, to the extent the cash bridge facility is not otherwise repaid using Allergans cash on hand, the cash bridge facility. Disruptions in the commercial credit markets or uncertainty in the United States, European Union or elsewhere could result in a tightening of financial markets. As a result of financial market turmoil, Actavis may not be able to obtain alternate financing in order to repay the bridge loan facilities or refinance the bridge loan facilities on favorable terms (or at all).
If Actavis is unable to successfully obtain alternative financing or refinance the bridge loan facilities at favorable terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, pricing and other fee payments), this could result in additional costs to Actavis. If Actavis is unable to obtain alternate financing or refinance at all, the outstanding amounts under the $30.9 billion Bridge Credit Agreement must be repaid within 364 days after the consummation of the merger and, if the $4.698 billion cash bridge facility is necessary, the cash bridge facility must be repaid within 60 days after the consummation of the merger.
The Pending Allergan Acquisition may not be accretive and may cause dilution to Actavis earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of Actavis ordinary shares.
Although Actavis currently anticipates that the Pending Allergan Acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share (on a non-GAAP adjusted earnings basis) from and after the Pending Allergan Acquisition, this expectation is based on preliminary estimates, which may change materially.
Actavis expects to issue or reserve for issuance approximately 128 millionordinary shares to pay the aggregate stock portion of the merger consideration to Allergan stockholders and assume Allergan equity-based awards at the closing of the Pending Allergan Acquisition. Actavis also expects to issue ordinary shares and/or mandatorily convertible preferred equity interests to finance a portion of the aggregate cash portion of the merger consideration on terms that cannot be predicted.
In addition, Actavis could also encounter additional transaction-related costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the Pending Allergan Acquisition. All of these factors could cause dilution to Actavis earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Pending Allergan Acquisition and cause a decrease in the market price of Actavis ordinary shares.
Legislative or other governmental action relating to the denial of U.S. federal or state governmental contracts to U.S. companies that redomicile abroad could adversely affect Actavis business.
Various U.S. federal and state legislative and other proposals that would deny governmental contracts to U.S. companies (and subsidiaries of U.S. companies) that move (or have moved) their corporate location abroad may affect Actavis if adopted. The likelihood that any such proposals might be adopted, the nature of regulations that might be promulgated, or the effect such adoptions and increased regulatory scrutiny might have on Actavis business cannot be predicted.

Movement of products between categories may occur from time to time based on changes in promotional activities.
Net revenues in our North American Brands segment include product sales and other revenue derived from branded products. Our North American Brands segment product line includes a variety of products and dosage forms. In October 2013, as a result of the Warner Chilcott Acquisition, we began promoting a number of products, including, but not limited to, Asacol  HD, Delzicol  , Estrace  Cream, Lo Loestrin  Fe and Minastrin  24 Fe. In July 2014, as a result of the Forest Acquisition, the Company also began recognizing revenues on key North American brands, including, but not limited to, Bystolic  , Canasa  , Carafate  , Daliresp  , Fetzima  , Linzess  , Namenda  , Namenda XR  , Saphris  , Teflaro  and Viibryd  .
The increase in revenues is primarily due to the results of the Forest Acquisition of $2,249.8 million, which did not account for any sales in the year ended December31, 2013, and the results of Warner Chilcott Acquisition, which had $1,774.9 million of sales in the year ended December31, 2014, compared to $480.7 million in sales in the year ended December31, 2013.
Other revenues consist primarily of royalties, milestone receipts, commission income and revenue from licensing arrangements, co-promotion revenue and the recognition of deferred revenue relating to our obligation to manufacture and supply brand products to third parties. Other revenues also include revenue recognized from R&D and licensing agreements.
Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes production and packaging costs for the products we manufacture, third party acquisition costs for products manufactured by others, profit-sharing or royalty payments for products sold pursuant to licensing agreements, inventory reserve charges and excess capacity utilization charges, where applicable. Cost of sales does not include amortization or impairment costs for acquired product rights or other acquired intangibles.
The increase in cost of sales was due to higher product sales driving the corresponding cost of sales, primarily as a result of the Forest Acquisition ($1,141.7 million), including the impact of selling through a portion of the inventory associated with the fair value step-up of the July1, 2014 Forest inventory acquired of $652.8 million. Also impacting cost of sales is the period-over-period impact of the October1, 2013 Warner Chilcott Acquisition of $176.4 million, including the increase in the amount sold for the fair value step-up portion of the inventory acquired of $221.5 million and $152.1 million for the years ended December31, 2014 versus 2013, respectively.
Selling and Marketing Expenses Selling and marketing expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, product promotion costs, distribution costs, professional service costs, insurance, depreciation and travel costs.
The increase in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to higher selling and marketing costs associated with the Forest Acquisition of $562.7 million, including expenses associated with stock-based compensation (which includes the fair value adjustment of the awards as part of acquisition accounting) for awards issued to acquired Forest employees of $58.7 million as well as integration and restructuring costs associated with the Forest Acquisition of $49.1 million. Also impacting the increase in selling and marketing expenses is the period-over-period impact of the Warner Chilcott Acquisition of $146.2 million, as well as a charge of $105.0 million to account for an additional year of the non-tax deductible Branded Prescription Drug Fee in accordance with final regulations issued in the third quarter of 2014 by the Internal Revenue Service, offset, in part, by decreased spending as a result of restructuring activities related to the Actavis Group during the year ended December31, 2013.
General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, facilities costs, transaction costs, insurance, depreciation, litigation and settlement costs and professional services costs which are general in nature.
74 Table of Contents The increase in general and administrative expenses was due in part to increased operating costs related to the expansion of the Companys size, including costs incurred by Forest for ongoing operating expenses of $149.6 million as well as acquisition related expenses, which includes stock-based compensation charges (including the fair value adjustment of the awards as part of acquisition accounting) of $152.6 million, severance related charges of $56.8 million and other integration and financing costs of $94.2 million. Also impacting general and administrative expenses is the period-over-period impact of the Warner Chilcott Acquisition which resulted in increased costs of $118.7 million as well as an increase in legal settlements and reserves.

Net revenues in our North American Generics and International segment consisted of the following ($ in millions): YearsEnded December 31, Change 2014 2013 Dollars % North American Generics $ 4,173.6 $ 3,915.7 $ 257.9 6.6 % International 2,573.6 2,502.5 71.1 2.8 % Net revenues $ 6,747.2 $ 6,418.2 $ 329.0 5.1 % The North American Generics and International segment includes certain trademarked off-patent products that the Company sells and markets as off-patent pharmaceutical products that are therapeutically equivalent to proprietary products within North America. Also included in this segment are international revenues which include patent-protected and off-patent products that the Company sells and markets as brand pharmaceutical products, certain trademarked off-patent products that the Company sells and markets as off-patent pharmaceutical products that are therapeutically equivalent to proprietary products, over the counter products and revenues from our third party Medis business. Our North American Generics and International segment product line includes a variety of products and dosage forms. Indications for this line include, but are not limited to, pregnancy prevention, pain management, depression, hypertension, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and smoking cessation. Dosage forms include oral solids, semi-solids, liquids, gels, transdermals, injectables, inhalation and oral transmucosals. Our generic products are the therapeutic equivalent to their brand name counterparts and are generally sold at prices significantly less than the branded product. As such, generic products provide an effective and cost-efficient alternative to brand products. When patents or other regulatory exclusivity no longer protect a branded product, or if we are successful in developing a bioequivalent, non-infringing version of a branded product, opportunities exist to introduce off-patent or generic counterparts to the 75 Table of Contents branded product. Additionally, we distribute Authorized Generics to the extent such arrangements are complementary to our core business. Our portfolio of generic products includes products we have internally developed, products we have licensed from third parties and products we distribute for third parties.
Within North American Generics, revenue by product moves based on the timing of launches, including an exclusivity period in certain circumstances, and the amount of generic competition in the market. An increase in competition can decrease both volume and the price received for each product. The increase in North American Generics revenues was primarily the result of changes in product mix including new product launches and competition on existing products.
The increase in international revenues is primarily due to the results of the Forest Acquisition of $123.1 million, which had no sales in the year ended December31, 2013, and Warner Chilcott Acquisition, which had $181.4 million of sales in the year ended December31, 2014, compared to $64.7 million in sales in the year ended December31, 2013. In addition to the impact of the acquisitions, the Company had growth across a number of the international markets, offset, in part by the period-over-period decrease in revenues associated with the divested Western European assets of $237.3 million.
Other revenues consist primarily of royalties, milestone receipts, commission income and revenue from licensing arrangements, co-promotion revenue and the recognition of deferred revenue relating to our obligation to manufacture and supply brand products to third parties. Other revenues also include revenue recognized from R&D and licensing agreements.
Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes production and packaging costs for the products we manufacture, third party acquisition costs for products manufactured by others, profit-sharing or royalty payments for products sold pursuant to licensing agreements, inventory reserve charges and excess capacity utilization charges, where applicable. Cost of sales does not include amortization or impairment costs for acquired product rights or other acquired intangibles.
The decrease in cost of sales is due to cost savings resulting from our global supply chain initiatives and divestitures in Western Europe which had a period-over-period reduction of $133.3 million. Offsetting these measures, in part, was an increase in cost of sales due to the Forest Acquisition of $152.2 million, including the impact of selling through a portion of the inventory associated with the fair value step-up of the July1, 2014 Forest inventory acquired of $98.2 million. Also contributing to the movement is an increase in expenses resulting from the Warner Chilcott Acquisition of $21.8 million.
Selling and Marketing Expenses Selling and marketing expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, product promotion costs, distribution costs, professional service costs, insurance, depreciation and travel costs. The increase in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the acquired Forest business of $33.9 million, the period-over-period impact of the acquired Warner Chilcott business of $15.8 million, as well as a charge of $10.8 million to account for an additional year of the non-tax deductible Branded Prescription Drug Fee in accordance with final regulations issued in the third quarter by the Internal Revenue Service, offset, in part, by savings due to the restructuring of the legacy Actavis business as well as the sale of our Western European assets.
General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, facilities costs, transaction costs, insurance, depreciation, litigation and settlement costs and professional services costs, which are general in nature. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due the restructuring of the legacy Actavis Group and the disposal of our Western European assets, offset, in part, by costs incurred in connection with the acquired Forest business of $41.7 million.

The increase in net revenues is primarily due to the Warner Chilcott Acquisition, which contributed three months of sales in 2013 compared to no sales in the prior period ($480.7 million). Also contributing to the increase are higher U.S. unit sales related to the continued product sales growth from Rapaflo  and the continued product sales growth from Generess  Fe and sales of Kadian  acquired as part of the Actavis Group Acquisition ($73.1 million).
Cost of Sales The increase in cost of sales was mainly due to the full year manufacturing expenses of products resulting from the Warner Chilcott Acquisition ($201.1 million), including the impact of selling through a portion of the fair value step-up of the October1, 2013 Warner Chilcott inventory ($152.1 million). Also contributing to the increase were increased product volume primarily from Rapaflo  .
Selling and Marketing Expenses The increase in selling and marketing expenses within our North American Brands segment was primarily due to costs associated with the Warner Chilcott Acquisition ($71.3 million) including co-promotion costs to Sanofi ($39.5 million).
General and Administrative Expenses The increase in general and administrative expenses was due in part to higher legacy domestic costs including increased personnel, legal fees and other costs, costs incurred by Warner Chilcott for restructuring charges of $124.7 million including stock-based compensation ($45.4 million), costs incurred in order to complete to the Warner Chilcott Acquisition of $45.6 million and higher stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes resulting from the acceleration of directors and named executive officers unvested equity-based awards immediately prior to the Warner Chilcott Acquisition of $20.7 million.

Also contributing to the movement are higher U.S. unit sales related to new products including lidocaine topical patch 5% ($392.9 million) and mixed amphetamine (Adderall XR  CII) ($145.2 million); offset in part by lower net sales of certain U.S. products including the authorized generic version of Lipitor  (atorvastatin) ($403.6 million, of which $24.3 million is due to price and $379.3 million is due to volume) and declines in other international revenues.
Cost of Sales The increase in cost of sales was mainly due to the full year manufacturing expenses of products resulting from the Actavis Group Acquisition of $1,508.6 million in the year ended December31, 2013 versus $284.2 million in the year ended December31, 2012 and higher product sales as a result of the Warner Chilcott Acquisition ($30.8 million), including the impact of selling through a portion of the fair value step-up of the October1, 2013 Warner Chilcott inventory ($21.4 million). Also contributing to the increase were contingent consideration fair value adjustments associated with previous business combinations, new product launches including the September 2013 launch of a generic version of Lidoderm  (lidocaine topical patch 5%) ($120.5 million) and mixed ampethamine (Adderall XR  CII) ($36.1 million), offset, in part by a decrease in costs resulting from lower Lipitor  sales ($251.6 million) and other products sold.
85 Table of Contents Selling and Marketing Expenses The increase in selling and marketing expenses within our North American Generics and International segment was primarily due to the full year effect of higher selling and marketing expenses incurred resulting from the Actavis Group Acquisition ($427.7 million) compared to only two months in 2012 ($74.0 million). In addition, as a result of the Warner Chilcott Acquisition, the Company incurred $9.9 million of selling and marketing costs in the year ended December31, 2013.
General and Administrative Expenses The increase in general and administrative expenses was due in part to the increase resulting from the costs relating to the Actavis Group Acquisition of $206.5 million versus the prior year period.

In the year ended December31, 2012, we recorded an impairment charge related to IPR&D intangible assets acquired in connection with the Specifar acquisition of $101.0 million relating to three products in development as a result of various factors occurring during the same period mainly related to delays in expected launch dates, competitive factors resulting in realization of lower pricing and incremental costs related to manufacturing efforts. These events led to revised estimates of the fair value of each IPR&D asset compared to the carrying values of $101.0 million.

Asset sales, other impairments and contingent considerations, net for the year ended December31, 2013 included a charge associated with the issuance of an additional 1.65million Ordinary Shares in connection with the Actavis Group Acquisition ($150.3 million), an impairment charge related to a facility in Greece ($19.4 million), an impairment of fixed assets in Serbia ($24.2 million), an impairment of a product right intangible asset in connection with the Specifar acquisition ($13.9 million), the impairment of the Gabapentin asset acquired as part of the Actavis Group Acquisition ($10.8 million), a loss on the termination of the agreement with Moksha8 ($4.0 million) and the impairment of the Curosurf assets ($2.5 million), offset, in part, by gains related to the sale of our Russian subsidiary ($11.7 million), a manufacturing facility in India ($4.5 million), and other miscellaneous gains. The impairment charges recognized were due to various factors impacting future value to be realized by such assets.
Asset sales, other impairments and contingent considerations, net for the year ended December31, 2012 includes a non-cash impairment charge related to product rights intangible assets acquired in connection with the Specifar acquisition ($16.8 million), an impairment charge related to a manufacturing facility located in Greece ($40.3 million), an impairment related to the sale of a German subsidiary ($17.6 million) and an impairment related to API manufacturing assets in India ($1.6 million). Partially offsetting these charges was a fair value adjustment of the contingent obligation due to the Specifar selling shareholders based on esomeprazole gross profits ($27.5 million) and net gains on miscellaneous asset sales ($0.3 million). The impairment relating to the intangible assets acquired in connection with the Specifar acquisition was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2012 and related to esomeprazole product rights following the Companys decision to discontinue selling the product as a result of products acquired in connection with the Actavis Group Acquisition ($16.8 million). The impairment for the Greece facility was due to a change in the intended use of the facility as a result of the Companys decision during the third quarter of 2012 to discontinue further construction as a result of the planned acquisition of the Actavis Group.

In addition, the pre-tax expense for the amortization of Warner Chilcotts inventory and intangible step-up resulted in a rate detriment of $152.8 million. These items were partially offset by non-taxable pre-tax income of $15.0 million related to the Arrow Acquisition and $50.2 million primarily related to the carryback of current year capital losses against prior year capital gains. The effective tax rate for the year ended December31, 2012 was impacted by the non-deductibility of a loss from foreign exchange derivatives partially offset by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities relating to the Ascent Acquisition. The effective tax rate was also impacted by losses in certain non-US jurisdictions for which no tax benefit is provided and the amortization of intangible assets being tax benefited at a lower rate than the U.S. federal tax rate.

98 Table of Contents Other significant R&D milestone payments include:  Amounts owed to Amgen of up to $254.8 million;  Amounts owed to PregLem, to develop and, if approved, market products under development in the United States and Canada of $74.0 million relating to Esmya in the United States and Fibristal in Canada;  Amounts owed to Medicines360 relating to LNG 20 in the United States and Canada of $122.5 million;  Amounts owed to Paratek Pharmaceuticals Inc. under which we acquired certain rights to novel tetracyclines under development for the treatment of acne and rosacea of $17.0 million;  Amounts owed to Almirall, S.A. relating to the development and approval of an Aclidinium/Formoteral combination product of $50.0 million;  Amounts owed to Gideon Richter relating to the development and approval of Cariprazine of $50.0 million; and  Amounts owed to Janssen Pharmaceutica NV relating to the development and approval of Eluxadoline of $35.0 million.
We also have potential sales based milestones based on certain licensing agreements, which are not included in the table above as they are subject to the achievement of future results.
Milestone payment obligations are uncertain, including the prediction of timing and the occurrence of events triggering a future obligation and are not reflected as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Amounts in the table above do not include royalty obligations on future sales of product as the timing and amount of future sales levels and costs to produce products subject to milestone obligations is not reasonably estimable.
(6) Other obligations and commitments include agreements to purchase third-party manufactured products, capital purchase obligations for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment and the liability for income tax associated with uncertain tax positions.
(7) Total does not include contractual obligations already included in current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet (except for capital leases, contingent consideration and the current portion of long-term debt) or certain purchase obligations, which are discussed below.
For purposes of the table above, obligations for the purchase of goods or services are included only for purchase orders that are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the timing of the obligation. Our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are typically fulfilled by our suppliers within a relatively short period. At December31, 2014, we have open purchase orders that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements that are not included in the table above.
We are involved in certain equity investments that are intended to complement our core business and markets. We have the discretion to provide funding on occasion for working capital or capital expenditures. We make an evaluation of additional funding based on an assessment of the ventures business opportunities. We believe that any possible commitments arising from the current arrangements will not be significant to our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, net revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
99 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The significant accounting estimates that we believe are important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:  Revenue Recognition Including Multiple-Element Arrangements  Inventory Valuation  Product Rights and other Definite-Lived Intangible Assets  Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite-Lives  Allocation of Acquisition Fair Values to Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed  Contingent Consideration and Other Commitments In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and requires managements best estimates of the underlying data in its application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting among available GAAP alternatives would not produce a materially different result.
Revenue Recognition Including Multiple-Element Arrangements General Revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss to the product transfers to the customer, which is based on the transaction shipping terms. Recognition of revenue also requires reasonable assurance of collection of sales proceeds, the sellers price to the buyer to be fixed or determinable and the completion of all performance obligations. The Company warrants products against defects and for specific quality standards, permitting the return of products under certain circumstances. Product sales are recorded net of all sales-related deductions including, but not limited to: chargebacks, trade discounts, billback adjustments, sales returns and allowances, commercial and government rebates, customer loyalty programs and fee for service arrangements with certain distributors, which we refer to in the aggregate as SRA allowances.
Royalty and commission revenue is recognized as a component of net revenues in accordance with the terms of their respective contractual agreements when collectability is reasonably assured and when revenue can be reasonably measured.
Multiple-Element Arrangements The Company identifies each discrete deliverable included in a multiple-element arrangement and identifies which of those deliverables have standalone value to the customer under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 605-25 Revenue Recognition  Multiple-Element Arrangements (ASC 605-25) and Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-13 Revenue Recognition  Multiple-Deliverable Revenue (ASU No.2009-13). The Company allocates arrangement consideration to the deliverables based on the appropriate selling price using the hierarchy outlined in ASC 605-25, as amended by ASU No.2009-13. The selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or best estimated selling price (BESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. BESP is determined in a manner consistent with that used to establish the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis. Revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting based on the relevant authoritative literature for that deliverable.
100 Table of Contents Contingency-Adjusted Performance Model Revenues recognized from research, development and licensing agreements (including milestone receipts) are recorded on the contingency-adjusted performance model which requires deferral of revenue until such time as contract milestone requirements have been met. Under this model, revenue related to each payment is recognized over the entire contract performance period, starting with the contracts commencement, but not prior to earning and/or receiving the milestone amount (i.e., removal of any contingency). The amount of revenue recognized is based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated cost to be incurred. In certain circumstances, it may be appropriate to recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved. In order to recognize milestone consideration as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved, there needs to be substantive certainty that the milestone will be achieved, relate solely to past performance and the consideration needs to be commensurate with the Companys performance. Factors the Company considers in determining whether a milestone is substantive at the inception of an arrangement include: whether substantive effort will be required to achieve the milestone; what labor, skill, and other costs will be incurred to achieve the milestone; how certain the achievement of the milestone is; whether a reasonable amount of time will elapse between any upfront payment and the first milestone as well as between each successive milestone; and, whether the milestone is nonrefundable or contains clawback provisions.
Provisions for SRAs As is customary in the pharmaceutical industry, our gross product sales are subject to a variety of deductions in arriving at reported net product sales. When the Company recognizes gross revenue from the sale of products, an estimate of SRA is recorded, which reduces the gross product revenues. Accounts receivable and/or accrued liabilities are also reduced and/or increased by the SRA amount. These provisions are estimated based on historical payment experience, historical relationship of the deductions to gross product revenues, government regulations, estimated utilization or redemption rates, estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers. The estimation process used to determine our SRA provision has been applied on a consistent basis and no material revenue adjustments have been necessary to increase or decrease our reserves for SRA as a result of a significant change in underlying estimates. The Company uses a variety of methods to assess the adequacy of the SRA reserves to ensure that our financial statements are fairly stated. This includes periodic reviews of customer inventory data, customer contract programs and product pricing trends to analyze and validate the SRA reserves.
Chargebacks A chargeback represents an amount payable in the future to a wholesaler for the difference between the invoice price paid by our wholesale customer for a particular product and the negotiated contract price that the wholesalers customer pays for that product. The chargeback provision and related reserve varies with changes in product mix, changes in customer pricing and changes to estimated wholesaler inventories. The provision for chargebacks also takes into account an estimate of the expected wholesaler sell-through levels to indirect customers at certain contract prices. The Company validates the chargeback accrual quarterly through a review of the inventory reports obtained from our largest wholesale customers. This customer inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future chargeback claims based on historical chargeback and contract rates. These large wholesalers represent the vast majority of the recipients of the Companys chargeback payments. We continually monitor current pricing trends and wholesaler inventory levels to ensure the liability for future chargebacks is fairly stated.
Rebates Rebates include volume related incentives to direct and indirect customers, third party managed care and Medicare Part D rebates, Medicaid rebates and other government rebates. Rebates are accrued based on an estimate of claims to be paid for product sold into trade by the Company. Volume rebates are generally offered to customers as an incentive to use the Companys products and to encourage greater product sales. These rebate programs include contracted rebates based on customers purchases made during an applicable monthly, quarterly or annual period. The provision for third-party rebates is estimated based on our customers contracted rebate programs and the Companys historical experience of rebates paid. Any significant changes to our customer rebate programs are considered in establishing the provision for rebates. The provisions for government rebates are based, in part, upon historical experience of claims submitted by the various states / 101 Table of Contents authorities, contractual terms and government regulations. We monitor legislative changes to determine what impact such legislation may have on our provision.
Cash Discounts Cash discounts are provided to customers that pay within a specific period. The provision for cash discounts is estimated based upon invoice billings, utilizing historical customer payment experience. The Companys experience of payment history is fairly consistent and most customer payments qualify for the cash discount. Accordingly, our reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable.
Returns and Other Allowances The Companys provision for returns and other allowances include returns, pricing adjustments, promotional allowances, loyalty cards and billback adjustments.
Consistent with industry practice, the Company maintains a returns policy that allows customers to return product for a credit. In accordance with the Companys policy, credits for customer returns of products are applied against outstanding account activity or are settled in cash. Product exchanges are not permitted. Customer returns of product are generally not resalable. The Companys estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience and current trends of actual customer returns. Additionally, we consider other factors when estimating the current period returns provision, including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, as well as significant market changes which may impact future expected returns.
Pricing adjustments, which includes shelf stock adjustments, are credits issued to reflect decreases in selling prices charged to the Companys direct customers. Shelf stock adjustments are based upon the amount of product our customers have in their inventory at the time of an agreed-upon price reduction. The provision for shelf stock adjustments is based upon specific terms with the Companys direct customers and includes estimates of existing customer inventory levels based upon their historical purchasing patterns. We regularly monitor all price changes to evaluate the Companys reserve balances. The adequacy of these reserves is readily determinable as pricing adjustments and shelf stock adjustments are negotiated and settled on a customer-by-customer basis.
Promotional allowances are credits that are issued in connection with a product launch or as an incentive for customers to carry our product. The Company establishes a reserve for promotional allowances based upon contractual terms.
Billback adjustments are credits that are issued to certain customers who purchase directly from us as well as indirectly through a wholesaler. These credits are issued in the event there is a difference between the customers direct and indirect contract price. The provision for billbacks is estimated based upon historical purchasing patterns of qualified customers who purchase product directly from us and supplement their purchases indirectly through our wholesale customers.
Loyalty cards allow the end user patients a discount per prescription and is accrued based on historical experience, contract terms and the volume of product and cards in the distribution channel.
The following table summarizes the activity in the Companys major categories of SRA (in millions): Chargebacks Rebates Returns and Other Allowances Cash Discounts Total Balance at December31, 2011 $ 160.9 $ 489.0 $ 122.0 $ 34.9 $ 806.8 Add: Actavis Group Acquisition 94.3 359.4 171.4 9.7 634.8 Provision related to sales in 2012 1,522.4 1,484.4 485.5 155.2 3,647.5 Credits and payments (1,566.1 ) (1,482.0 ) (429.4 ) (162.9 ) (3,640.4 ) Balance at December31, 2012 $ 211.5 $ 850.8 $ 349.5 $ 36.9 $ 1,448.7 Add: Warner Chilcott Acquisition 5.6 255.5 121.3 5.5 387.9 Less: Assets held for sale  (155.2 ) (3.3 ) (1.0 ) (159.5 ) Less: Actavis Acquisition measurement period adjustment  (31.0 )   (31.0 ) Provision related to sales in 2013 2,340.0 2,339.1 904.1 201.7 5,784.9 Credits and payments (2,310.7 ) (2,197.4 ) (753.7 ) (195.4 ) (5,457.2 ) Balance at December31, 2013 $ 246.4 $ 1,061.8 $ 617.9 $ 47.7 $ 1,973.8 102 Table of Contents Chargebacks Rebates Returns and Other Allowances Cash Discounts Total Add: Forest Acquisition 27.9 425.0 94.3 9.8 557.0 Less: Warner Chilcott acquisition measurement period adjustment  (34.3 ) (22.3 )  (56.6 ) Provision related to sales in 2014 4,591.7 3,323.9 859.4 350.7 9,125.7 Credits and payments (4,301.1 ) (3,029.8 ) (937.2 ) (347.5 ) (8,615.6 ) Balance at December31, 2014 $ 564.9 $ 1,746.6 $ 612.1 $ 60.7 $ 2,984.3 During the year ended December31, 2014, the Company lowered SRA balances relating to the valuation of assets and liabilities as part of the Warner Chilcott Acquisition measurement period adjustment by $56.6 million, with an offset to goodwill ($36.8million) and deferred tax liabilities ($19.8million).
The provisions recorded to reduce gross product sales to net product sales were as follows: Year Ended December31, GrossProduct Sales Chargebacks Rebates Returnsand Other Allowances Cash Discounts NetProduct Sales Gross-to-net Percentage 2012 $ 9,430.7 $ 1,522.4 $ 1,484.4 $ 485.5 $ 155.2 $ 5,783.2 61.3 % 2013 $ 14,276.7 $ 2,340.0 $ 2,339.1 $ 904.1 $ 201.7 $ 8,491.8 59.5 % 2014 $ 22,010.1 $ 4,591.7 $ 3,323.9 $ 859.4 $ 350.7 $ 12,884.4 58.5 % Included in the tables above are accounts receivable deductions within SRAs of $1,660.9 million and $1,254.8 million at December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. SRAs within accounts payable and accrued expenses were $1,323.4 million and $719.0million at December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
The movement in the percentage of provisions to gross sales is a result of changes in product mix, competition and channels of distribution. In the year ended December31, 2014, the Company increased sales of branded products, which lowered the provision percentage. Offsetting this, was the impact of increased generic competition on some of the Companys larger generic products which increased the rebates offered, as well as a higher portion of sales going through the wholesale channel, which has the impact of raising the rebate and chargeback percentages.
The Company does not expect future payments of SRA reserves to materially exceed our current estimates. However, if future SRA payments were to materially exceed our estimates, such adjustments may have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Inventory Valuation Inventories consist of finished goods held for distribution, raw materials and work in process. Included in inventory are generic pharmaceutical products that are capitalized only when the bioequivalence of the product is demonstrated or the product is already FDA approved and is awaiting a contractual triggering event to enter the marketplace. Inventory also includes brand pharmaceutical products which represents FDA approved indications. Inventory valuation reserves are established based on a number of factors/situations including, but not limited to, raw materials, work in process, or finished goods not meeting product specifications, product obsolescence, or application of the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market (net realizable value) concepts. The determination of events requiring the establishment of inventory valuation reserves, together with the calculation of the amount of such reserves may require judgment. Assumptions utilized in our quantification of inventory reserves include, but are not limited to, estimates of future product demand, consideration of current and future market conditions, product net selling price, anticipated product launch dates, potential product obsolescence and other events relating to special circumstances surrounding certain products. No material adjustments have been required to our inventory reserve estimates for the periods presented. Adverse changes in assumptions utilized in our inventory reserve calculations could result in an increase to our inventory valuation reserves and higher cost of sales.
103 Table of Contents Product Rights and Other Definite-Lived Intangible Assets Our product rights and other definite-lived intangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization, and are amortized using the economic benefit model or the straight-line method, if results are materially aligned, over their estimated useful lives. We determine amortization periods for product rights and other definite-lived intangible assets based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows. Such factors include the products position in its life cycle, the existence or absence of like products in the market, various other competitive and regulatory issues, and contractual terms. Significant changes to any of these factors may result in a reduction in the intangibles useful life and an acceleration of related amortization expense, which could cause our net results to decline.
Product rights and other definite-lived intangible assets are tested periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an assets carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment testing involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows. In the event the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying value is considered not recoverable and an impairment exists. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value, calculated using a discounted future cash flow method. The computed impairment loss is recognized in net (loss) / income in the period that the impairment occurs. Assets which are not impaired may require an adjustment to the remaining useful lives for which to amortize the asset. Our projections of discounted cash flows use a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model. Our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our other definite-lived intangible assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors. Different assumptions and judgments could materially affect the calculation of the fair value of the other definite-lived intangible assets which could trigger impairment.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite-Lives Intangibles IPR&D intangible assets represent the value assigned to acquired research and development projects that, as of the date acquired, represent the right to develop, use, sell and/or offer for sale a product or other intellectual property that we have acquired with respect to products and/or processes that have not been completed or approved. The IPR&D intangible assets will be subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of each project. Upon abandonment, the IPR&D asset is impaired. Upon successful completion of each project and approval of the product, we will make a separate determination of useful life of the intangible, transfer the amount to currently marketed products and amortization expense will be recorded over the estimated useful life.
Impairment testing requires the development of significant estimates and assumptions involving the determination of estimated net cash flows for each year for the business as well as each project or product (including net revenues, cost of sales, research and development costs, selling and marketing costs and other costs which may be allocated), the appropriate discount rate to select in order to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each assets life cycle, competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream as well as other factors. Changes in these assumptions or uncertainties could result in future impairment charges. No assurances can be given that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will not change or the timely completion of each project to commercial success will occur. For these and other reasons, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results.
Goodwill Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying amount of the net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment, if any, would be recorded in operating income and this could result in a material reduction in net (loss) / income and earnings per share.
General We test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite-lives for impairment annually during the second quarter by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units as determined by a five year cash-flow forecast 104 Table of Contents with a terminal value, to the respective carrying value of the reporting units. Additionally, we may perform tests between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that could potentially reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The carrying value of each reporting unit is determined by assigning the assets and liabilities, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units.
During the second quarter of 2014, we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill, IPR&D intangible assets and trade name intangibles assets with indefinite-lives. The Company utilized discount rates for its reporting units ranging from 7.5% to 9.5% and long-term growth rates ranging from 2.0% to 4.5% in its estimation of fair value. The factors used in evaluating goodwill for impairment are subject to change and are tracked against historical results by management. Changes in the key assumptions by management can change the results of testing. The Company determined there was no impairment associated with goodwill or intangible assets from the annual impairment test as of June 30, 2014. The Company noted impairments due to specific events for various products as discussed in Goodwill Impairments and In-process research and development impairments earlier in Item7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
During the 2013 integration of the Actavis Group with the Watson business, the Company reorganized its organizational structure and management performance reporting, which was then further reorganized in January of 2014 and July of 2014. In 2013, the reporting units within our then current Actavis Pharma operating segment were organized as follows: Americas (The United States of America (U.S.), Canada, Latin America), Europe (Europe, Russia, Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and Turkey), and MEAAP (Middle East, Africa, Australia, and Asia Pacific). These reporting units combined the Watson and Actavis Group businesses. The combination of the Watson and the Actavis Group business and net assets in the European reporting unit, combined with other market factors, led to the impairment of the goodwill associated with this reporting unit in the second quarter of 2013.
During the second quarter of 2013, concurrent with the availability of discrete financial information for the then new reporting units, we completed an extensive review of our operating businesses, including exploring options for addressing overall profitability of seven Western European commercial operations consisting of, among other things, restructuring their operations, refocusing their activities on specific sub-markets, as well as potential divestitures of such businesses to other third parties.The potential impact of these conditions were considered in our projections when determining the indicated fair value of our reporting units for the impairment tests that were performed during the second quarter of 2013. Upon completion of step one of the impairment analysis for each of our reporting units, it was concluded the fair value of the then current Actavis Pharma  Europe reporting unit was below its carrying value including goodwill. This was primarily related to the integration of our Arrow Group with the Actavis Group in Europe. The fair value of our reporting units was estimated based on a discounted cash flow model using managements business plans and projections as the basis for expected future cash flows for approximately five years and residual growth rates ranging from 2% to 4% thereafter. Management believes that the assumptions it used for the impairment tests performed were consistent with those that would be utilized by a market participant in performing similar valuations of our then current reporting units. A separate discount rate was utilized for each reporting unit that was derived from published sources and, on a weighted average basis, a discount rate of 8% was utilized using our weighted average cost of capital, which considered the overall inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return a market participant would expect. As a result of completing step two of our impairment analysis, we recorded an impairment of the Actavis Pharma  Europe reporting unit of $647.5 million, representing primarily all the goodwill allocated to this reporting unit, in the year ended December31, 2013.
During the second quarter of 2012, we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill, IPR&D intangible assets and trade name intangibles assets with indefinite-lives. The Company determined there was no impairment associated with goodwill or trade name intangible assets.
Allocation of Acquisition Fair Values to Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business after the completion of 105 Table of Contents the acquisition. The fair value of the consideration paid, including contingent consideration, is assigned to the underlying net assets of the acquired business based on their respective fair values as determined using a market participant concept. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Intangible assets (including IPR&D assets upon successful completion of the project and approval of the product) are amortized to amortization expense over the expected life of the asset. Significant judgments are used in determining the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and in determining estimates of useful lives of long-lived assets. Fair value determinations and useful life estimates are based on, among other factors, estimates of expected future net cash flows, estimates of appropriate discount rates used to present value expected future net cash flow streams, the timing of approvals for IPR&D projects and the timing of related product launch dates, the assessment of each assets life cycle, the impact of competitive trends on each assets life cycle and other factors. These judgments can materially impact the estimates used to allocate acquisition date fair values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the future useful lives. For these and other reasons, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results.
Inventory is recorded at fair market value factoring in selling price and costs to dispose. Inventory acquired is typically valued higher than replacement cost.
Contingent Consideration and Other Commitments We determine the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration obligations based on a probability-weighted income approach derived from revenue estimates, post-tax gross profit levels and a probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving contingent obligations including contingent payments such as milestone obligations, royalty obligations and contract earn-out criteria, where applicable. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level3 measurement as defined using the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820. The resultant probability-weighted cash flows are discounted using an appropriate effective annual interest rate. At each reporting date, the contingent consideration obligation will be revalued to estimated fair value and changes in fair value will be reflected as income or expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations may result from changes in discount periods and rates, changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various contingent payment obligations. Adverse changes in assumptions utilized in our contingent consideration fair value estimates could result in an increase in our contingent consideration obligation and a corresponding charge to operating results.
We are involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of our business, including product liability litigation, intellectual property litigation, employment litigation and other litigation. We record reserves related to these legal matters when losses related to such litigation or contingencies are both probable and reasonably estimable. Refer to NOTE 24  Commitment and Contingencies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this document for a description of our significant current legal proceedings.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.2014-08 Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity. Under the new guidance, a disposal of a component of an entity or group of components of an entity that represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on operations and financial results is a discontinued operation when any of the following occurs: (i)it meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, (ii)it is disposed of by sale, or (iii)it is disposed of other than by sale. Also, a business that, on acquisition, meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale is reported in discontinued operations. Additionally, the new guidance requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations, as well as disclosure of the pre-tax profit or loss attributable to a disposal of an individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations presentation. The guidance is effective prospectively for all disposals (or classifications as held for sale) of components of an entity and all businesses that, on acquisition, 106 Table of Contents are classified as held for sale, that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December15, 2014, and interim periods within those years. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position as of December31, 2014 or results of operations for the year ended December31, 2014, however future transactions may be impacted.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606 (ASU 2014-09) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The issuance of these documents completes the joint effort by the FASB and the IASB to improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for GAAP and IFRS. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts). ASU 2014-09 will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. ASU 2014-09 also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition  Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. In addition, the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer (e.g., assets within the scope of Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, and intangible assets within the scope of Topic 350, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other) are amended to be consistent with the guidance on recognition and measurement (including the constraint on revenue) in this ASU.
The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, this pronouncement will have on future financial positions and results of operations.
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.2014-12 Compensation  Stock Compensation (Topic 718). This guidance clarifies the accounting for share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. In this case, the performance target would be required to be treated as a performance condition, and should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. The guidance also addresses when to recognize the related compensation cost. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December15, 2015. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, this pronouncement will have on future financial positions and results of operations.
In November 2014, the FASB ASU No.2014-16 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Pushdown Accounting a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force. The issued guidance provides an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. An acquired entity may elect the option to apply pushdown accounting in the reporting period in which the change-in-control event occurs. An acquired entity should determine whether to elect to apply pushdown accounting for each individual change-in-control event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. If pushdown accounting is not applied in the reporting period in which the change-in-control event occurs, an acquired entity will have the option to elect to apply pushdown accounting in a subsequent reporting period to the acquired entitys most recent change-in-control event. An election to apply pushdown accounting in a reporting period after the reporting period in which the change-in-control event occurred should be considered a change in accounting principle. If pushdown accounting is applied to an individual change-in-control event, that election is irrevocable. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position as of December31, 2014 or results of operations for the year ended December31, 2014.
ITEM7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following discussion provides forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk.Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments.The risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair 107 Table of Contents values, cash flows or future earnings. We are exposed to market risk for changes in the market values of our investments (Investment Risk), the impact of interest rate changes (Interest Rate Risk) and the impact of foreign currency exchange changes (Foreign Currency Exchange Risk).
We maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in a variety of securities, including both government and government agency obligations with ratings of A or better and money market funds. Our investments in marketable securities are governed by our investment policy which seeks to preserve the value of our principal, provide liquidity and maximize return on the Companys investment against minimal interest rate risk. Consequently, our interest rate and principal risk are minimal on our non-equity investment portfolio. The quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are set forth below.
Investment Risk As of December31, 2014, our total investments in marketable and equity securities of other companies, including equity method investments were $65.6 million (included in marketable securities and investments and other assets). The fair values of these investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the stock market and changes in general economic conditions.
We regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and recognize losses, for income statement purposes, when events and circumstances indicate that any declines in the fair values of such investments below our accounting basis are other than temporary.
Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our non-equity investment portfolio and our floating rate debt. Our cash is invested in bank deposits and A-rated or better money market mutual funds.
Our portfolio of marketable securities includes U.S. treasury and agency securities classified as available-for-sale securities, with no security having a maturity in excess of two years. These securities are exposed to interest rate fluctuations. Because of the short-term nature of these investments, we are subject to minimal interest rate risk and do not believe that an increase in market rates would have a significant negative impact on the realized value of our portfolio.
Floating Rate Debt At December31, 2014, there were borrowings outstanding of $255.0 million under our Revolver Agreement. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest based on one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus an applicable margin. At December31, 2014, borrowings outstanding under the WC Term Loan Agreement and the ACT Term Loan Agreement were $4,084.2 million. Assuming a one percent increase in the applicable interest rate, annual interest expense under the WC Term Loan Agreement and the ACT Term Loan Agreement would increase by approximately $40.8 million in 2015.
Fixed Rate Debt Changes in market interest rates generally affect the fair value of fixed-rate debt, but do not impact earnings or cash flows.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We operate and transact business in various foreign countries and are, therefore, subject to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company manages this foreign currency risk, in part, through operational means including managing foreign currency revenues in relation to same currency costs as well as managing foreign currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities. The Company is also exposed to the potential earnings effects from intercompany foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from normal trade receivables and payables and other intercompany loans. The Company seeks to limit exposure to foreign exchange risk involving intercompany trade receivables and payables by settling outstanding amounts through normal payment terms. Other methodologies to limit the Companys foreign exchange risks are being developed currently which may include foreign exchange forward contracts or options.
108 Table of Contents Net foreign currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 or 2012, respectively. In April 2012, the Company entered into foreign exchange derivative contracts including options and forward contracts, with an aggregate notional value of 4.25 billion, to hedge the Companys agreed upon purchase price of Actavis Group. These derivatives were purchased to mitigate exposure resulting from movements of the U.S. dollar against the Euro in connection with the Actavis Acquisition. The foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding were settled on October31, 2012.Since these derivatives are hedges of foreign currency exposures for a business combination denominated in a foreign currency, change in the value of the derivatives are recognized in the statement of operations. For the year ended December31, 2012, net losses on foreign exchange derivatives was $70.4 million.
At this time, we have no material commodity price risks.
We do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues or operations.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE There have been no changes in or disagreements with accountants on accounting or financial disclosure matters.
ITEM9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Companys Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective.
As required by SEC Rule13a-15(b), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Companys Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2014. Based on this evaluation, the Companys Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December31, 2014.
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined under Rule13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. We maintain internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective provides only reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
109 Table of Contents Management of the Company has assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014 based on criteria set forth in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by Committee of Sponsoring Organizations. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2014.
On July 1, 2014, the Company completed the Forest Acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition, certain elements of the acquired businesses internal control over financial reporting and related functions, processes and systems were integrated into the Companys existing internal control over financial reporting and related functions, processes and systems. As a result, management excluded the elements not integratedof Forest, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting. The elements not integrated represent controls over accounts of approximately 3.5% of total assets and 7.5% of net revenues of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, respectively.
The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.
Remediation of Prior Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management previously identified and disclosed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting with respect to segregation of duties and related information technology general controls regarding user access and change management activities. Specifically, the controls were not designed to provide reasonable assurance that incompatible access within the system, including the ability to record transactions, was appropriately segregated, impacting the validity, accuracy and completeness of all key accounts and disclosures. The locations impacted were principally related to the international entities acquired as part of the Actavis Group in 2012.
In response to this material weakness, changes were made to the Companys internal control over financial reporting, including enhancements to our process over granting access and monitoring segregation of duties conflicts in our Companys information technology systems and the creation of a governance function to implement a standardized change management program.
The Company has completed the documentation and testing of the corrective actions described above and, as of December31, 2014, has concluded that the remediation activities implemented are sufficient to allow us to conclude that the previously disclosed material weakness has been remediated as of December31, 2014.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting, during the fiscal quarter ended December31, 2014, that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As described in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded certain non-integrated aspects of Forest Laboratories, Inc. (Forest), a wholly-owned subsidiary, from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2014. We have also excluded those aspects of Forest from our audit of internal control over financial reporting, which represent approximately 3.5% of total assets and 7.5% of net revenues of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, respectively.

In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

F-13 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE1 Description of Business Actavis plc (formerly known as Actavis Limited) is a global specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the development, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of generic, branded generic, brand name (brand, branded or specialty brand), biosimilar and over-the-counter (OTC) pharmaceutical products. We also develop and out-license generic pharmaceutical products primarily in Europe through our Medis third-party business. In the third quarter of 2014, in connection with the Forest Acquisition (defined below), the Board of Directors realigned the Companys global strategic business structure. Under the new organizational structure, the Company organized its business into three operating segments: North American Brand, North American Generics and International, and Anda Distribution.
The Company has operations in more than 60 countries throughout North America (The United States of America (U.S.), Canada, and Puerto Rico) and the rest of world. The U.S. remains our largest commercial market and represented more than half of total net revenues for each of 2014, 2013 and 2012. As of December31, 2014, we marketed approximately 250 generic pharmaceutical product families and approximately 80 brand pharmaceutical product families in the U.S. and distributed approximately 12,650 stock-keeping units (SKUs) through our Anda Distribution segment.
NOTE 2  Formation of the Company Actavis plc (formerly known as Actavis Limited) was incorporated in Ireland on May16, 2013 as a private limited company and re-registered effective September18, 2013 as a public limited company. It was established for the purpose of facilitating the business combination between Actavis, Inc. and Warner Chilcott plc (Warner Chilcott). On October1, 2013, pursuant to the transaction agreement dated May19, 2013 among Actavis, Inc., Warner Chilcott, the Company, Actavis Ireland Holding Limited, Actavis W.C. Holding LLC (now known as Actavis W.C. Holding Inc.) and Actavis W.C. Holding 2 LLC (now known as Actavis W.C. Holding 2 Inc.) (MergerSub), (i)the Company acquired Warner Chilcott (the Warner Chilcott Acquisition) pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under Section201, and a capital reduction under Sections 72 and 74, of the Irish Companies Act of 1963 where each Warner Chilcott ordinary share was converted into 0.160 of an Actavis plc ordinary share (the Company Ordinary Shares), or $5,833.9 million in equity consideration, and (ii)MergerSub merged with and into Actavis, Inc., with Actavis, Inc. as the surviving corporation in the merger (the Merger and, together with the Warner Chilcott Acquisition, the Transactions). Following the consummation of the Transactions, Actavis, Inc. and Warner Chilcott became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Actavis plc. Each of Actavis, Inc.s common shares was converted into one Company Ordinary Share. Effective October1, 2013, through a series of related-party transactions, Actavis plc contributed its indirect subsidiaries, including Actavis, Inc. to Warner Chilcott Limited.
On October31, 2012, Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. completed the acquisition of the Actavis Group for a cash payment of 4.2 billion, or approximately $5.5 billion, and contingent consideration of 5.5million newly issued shares of Actavis, Inc., which have since been issued (the Actavis Group Acquisition). Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s Common Stock was traded on the NYSE under the symbol WPI until close of trading on January23, 2013, at which time Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. changed its corporate name to Actavis, Inc. and changed its ticker symbol to ACT.
References throughout to we, our, us, the Company or Actavis refer to financial information and transactions of Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. prior to January23, 2013, Actavis, Inc. from January23, 2013 until October1, 2013 and Actavis plc and Warner Chilcott Limited subsequent to October1, 2013.
References throughout to ordinary shares refer to Actavis, Inc.s ClassA common shares, par value $0.0033 per share, prior to the consummation of the Transactions and to Actavis plcs ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, since the consummation of the Transactions.

Actavis plcs ordinary shares are F-14 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) deemed to be registered under Section12(b) of the Exchange Act, and Actavis plc is subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Actavis plcs ordinary shares were approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and trade under the symbol ACT.
NOTE 3  Reconciliation of Warner Chilcott Limited results to Actavis plc results Warner Chilcott Limited is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Actavis plc, the ultimate parent of the group. The results of Warner Chilcott Limited are consolidated into the results of Actavis plc. Due to the deminimis activity between Actavis plc and Warner Chilcott Limited, references throughout this filing relate to both Actavis plc and WarnerChilcott Limited. Warner Chilcott Limited references relate only to itself and not to any other company.
Except where otherwise indicated, and excluding certain insignificant cash and non-cash transactions at the Actavis plc level, these notes relate to the consolidated financial statements for both separate registrants, Actavis plc and Warner Chilcott Limited. In addition to certain inter-company payable and receivable amounts between the entities, the following is a reconciliation of the results of Warner Chilcott Limited to Actavis plc.

(Allergan), the Forest Acquisition and the Warner Chilcott Acquisition. There were no differences between the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December31, 2012 as Actavis, Inc. was the predecessor company to both Actavis plc and Warner Chilcott Limited.
F-15 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) NOTE4 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP).The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of wholly owned subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.The consolidated financial information presented herein reflects all financial information that, in the opinion of management, is necessary for a fair statement of financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
The Companys consolidated financial statements include the financial results of all acquired companies subsequent to the acquisition date.
Reclassifications The Company has made certain reclassifications to prior period information to conform to the current period presentation, including expanding the categories disclosed in the accompanying statement of operations and cash flows to include In-process research and development impairments which were previously disclosed within the Asset sales, impairments, and contingent consideration adjustment, net line item.
Use of Estimates Management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions in order to prepare consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Companys most significant estimates relate to the determination of SRAs (defined below) included within either accounts receivable or accrued liabilities, the valuation of inventory balances, the determination of useful lives for intangible assets, pension and other post-retirement benefit plan assumptions, the assessment of expected cash flows used in evaluating goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment and recognition and measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations at fair value. The estimation process required to prepare the Companys consolidated financial statements requires assumptions to be made about future events and conditions, and as such, is inherently subjective and uncertain. The Companys actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
Foreign Currency Translation For most of the Companys international operations, the local currency has been determined to be the functional currency. The results of its non-U.S. dollar based operations are translated to U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates during the period. Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet date. Equity is translated at the prevailing rate of exchange at the date of the equity transaction. Translation adjustments are reflected in stockholders equity and are included as a component of other comprehensive (loss) / income. The effects of converting non-functional currency assets and liabilities into the functional currency are recorded as general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company realizes foreign currency gains / (losses) in the normal course of business based on movement in the applicable exchange rates. These gains / (losses) are included as a component of general and administrative expenses.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers cash and cash equivalents to include cash in banks, commercial paper and deposits with financial institutions that can be liquidated without prior notice or penalty. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
F-16 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts and other receivables, investments, trade accounts payable, and long-term debt, including the current portion. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts and other receivables and trade accounts payable are representative of their respective fair values due to their relatively short maturities. The fair values of investments in companies that are publicly traded and not accounted for under the equity method are based on quoted market prices. The Company estimates the fair value of its fixed rate long-term obligations based on quoted market rates. The carrying amount reported for long-term debt, other than the Companys indebtedness under senior notes, is considered to be representative of fair value as they are at variable rates and reprice frequently.
Inventories Inventories consist of finished goods held for sale and distribution, raw materials and work in process. Inventory includes product pending approval by the U.S.Food and Drug Administration (FDA), by other regulatory agencies or product that has not been launched due to contractual restrictions. This inventory consists of generic pharmaceutical products that are capitalized only when the bioequivalence of the product is demonstrated or the product has already received regulatory approval and is awaiting a contractual triggering event to enter the marketplace. Inventory also includes brand pharmaceutical products which represents FDA approved indications. Inventory valuation reserves are established based on a number of factors/situations including, but not limited to, raw materials, work in process, or finished goods not meeting product specifications, product obsolescence, or application of the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market (net realizable value) concepts.
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized, while routine maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes interest on qualified construction projects. At the time property, plant and equipment are retired from service, the cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the respective accounts.
Depreciation expense is computed principally on the straight-line method, over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The following table provides the range of estimated useful lives used for each asset type: Computer software / hardware (including internally developed) 3-10years Machinery and equipment 3-15 years Research and laboratory equipment 3-10 years Furniture and fixtures 3-10 years Buildings, improvements, leasehold improvements and other 4-50 years Transportation equipment 3-20 years The Company assesses property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Investments The Companys equity investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting when the Company can exert significant influence and the Companys ownership interest does not exceed 50%. The Company records equity method investments at cost and adjusts for the appropriate share of investee net earnings or losses. Investments in which the Company owns less than a 20% interest and cannot exert significant influence are accounted for using the cost method if the fair value of such investments is not readily determinable.
F-17 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Marketable Securities The Companys marketable securities consist of U.S.treasury and agency securities and equity securities of publicly-held companies. The Companys marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value, based upon quoted market prices. Unrealized temporary adjustments to fair value are included on the balance sheet in a separate component of stockholders equity as unrealized gains and losses and are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) / income. No gains or losses on marketable securities are realized until shares are sold or a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary. If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite-Lives The Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite-lives for impairment annually in the second quarter by comparing the fair value of each of the Companys reporting units to the respective carrying value of the reporting units. Additionally, the Company may perform interim tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that could potentially reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The carrying value of each reporting unit is determined by assigning the assets and liabilities, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units.
Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying amount of the net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment, if any, would be recorded in operating income and this could result in a material reduction in net income and earnings per share.
Acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) intangible assets represent the value assigned to acquired research and development projects that, as of the date acquired, represent the right to develop, use, sell and/or offer for sale a product or other intellectual property that the Company has acquired with respect to products and/or processes that have not been completed or approved. The IPR&D intangible assets are subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of each project. Upon abandonment, the assets are impaired. Impairment testing requires the development of significant estimates and assumptions involving the determination of estimated net cash flows for each year for each project or product (including net revenues, cost of sales, research and development (R&D) costs, selling and marketing costs and other costs which may be allocated), the appropriate discount rate to select in order to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each assets life cycle, competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream as well as other factors. The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of the IPR&D projects include legal risk and regulatory risk. Changes in these assumptions or uncertainties could result in future impairment charges. No assurances can be given that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will not change or the timely completion of each project to commercial success will occur. For these and other reasons, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results.
Upon successful completion of each project and approval of the product, we will make a separate determination of the useful life of the intangible, transfer the amount to currently marketed products (CMP) and amortization expense will be recorded over the estimated useful life.
Contingent Consideration Contingent consideration is recorded at the acquisition date estimated fair value of the contingent payment for all acquisitions. The fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured at each reporting period with any adjustments in fair value included in our consolidated statement of operations. (Refer to NOTE23  Fair Value Measurement for additional details regarding the fair value of contingent consideration.) F-18 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Revenue Recognition Including Multiple-Element Arrangements General Revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss to the product transfers to the customer, which is based on the transaction shipping terms. Recognition of revenue also requires reasonable assurance of collection of sales proceeds, the sellers price to the buyer to be fixed or determinable and the completion of all performance obligations. The Company warrants products against defects and for specific quality standards, permitting the return of products under certain circumstances. Product sales are recorded net of all sales-related deductions including, but not limited to: chargebacks, trade discounts, billback adjustments, sales returns and allowances, commercial and government rebates, customer loyalty programs and fee for service arrangements with certain distributors, which we refer to in the aggregate as SRA allowances.
Royalty and commission revenue is recognized as a component of net revenues in accordance with the terms of their respective contractual agreements when collectability is reasonably assured and when revenue can be reasonably measured.
Multiple-Element Arrangements The Company identifies each discrete deliverable included in a multiple-element arrangement and identifies which of those deliverables have standalone value to the customer under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 605-25 Revenue Recognition  Multiple-Element Arrangements (ASC 605-25) and Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-13 Revenue Recognition  Multiple-Deliverable Revenue (ASU No.2009-13). The Company allocates arrangement consideration to the deliverables based on the appropriate selling price using the hierarchy outlined in ASC 605-25, as amended by ASU No.2009-13. The selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or best estimated selling price (BESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. BESP is determined in a manner consistent with that used to establish the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis. Revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting based on the relevant authoritative literature for that deliverable.
Contingency-Adjusted Performance Model Revenues recognized from research, development and licensing agreements (including milestone receipts) are recorded on the contingency-adjusted performance model which requires deferral of revenue until such time as contract milestone requirements have been met. Under this model, revenue related to each payment is recognized over the entire contract performance period, starting with the contracts commencement, but not prior to earning and/or receiving the milestone amount (i.e., removal of any contingency). The amount of revenue recognized is based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated cost to be incurred. In certain circumstances, it may be appropriate to recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved. In order to recognize milestone consideration as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved, there needs to be substantive certainty that the milestone will be achieved, relate solely to past performance and the consideration needs to be commensurate with the Companys performance. Factors the Company considers in determining whether a milestone is substantive at the inception of an arrangement include: whether substantive effort will be required to achieve the milestone; what labor, skill, and other costs will be incurred to achieve the milestone; how certain the achievement of the milestone is; whether a reasonable amount of time will elapse between any upfront payment and the first milestone as well as between each successive milestone; and, whether the milestone is nonrefundable or contains clawback provisions.
Provisions for SRAs As is customary in the pharmaceutical industry, our gross product sales are subject to a variety of deductions in arriving at reported net product sales. When the Company recognizes gross revenue from the sale of products, F-19 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) an estimate of SRA is recorded, which reduces the gross product revenues. Accounts receivable and/or accrued liabilities are also reduced and/or increased by the SRA amount. These provisions are estimated based on historical payment experience, historical relationship of the deductions to gross product revenues, government regulations, estimated utilization or redemption rates, estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers. The estimation process used to determine our SRA provision has been applied on a consistent basis and no material revenue adjustments have been necessary to increase or decrease our reserves for SRA as a result of a significant change in underlying estimates. The Company uses a variety of methods to assess the adequacy of the SRA reserves to ensure that our financial statements are fairly stated. This includes periodic reviews of customer inventory data, customer contract programs and product pricing trends to analyze and validate the SRA reserves.
Chargebacks A chargeback represents an amount payable in the future to a wholesaler for the difference between the invoice price paid by our wholesale customer for a particular product and the negotiated contract price that the wholesalers customer pays for that product. The chargeback provision and related reserve varies with changes in product mix, changes in customer pricing and changes to estimated wholesaler inventories. The provision for chargebacks also takes into account an estimate of the expected wholesaler sell-through levels to indirect customers at certain contract prices. The Company validates the chargeback accrual quarterly through a review of the inventory reports obtained from our largest wholesale customers. This customer inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future chargeback claims based on historical chargeback and contract rates. These large wholesalers represent the vast majority of the recipients of the Companys chargeback payments. We continually monitor current pricing trends and wholesaler inventory levels to ensure the liability for future chargebacks is fairly stated.
Rebates Rebates include volume related incentives to direct and indirect customers, third-party managed care and Medicare Part D rebates, Medicaid rebates and other government rebates. Rebates are accrued based on an estimate of claims to be paid for product sold into trade by the Company. Volume rebates are generally offered to customers as an incentive to use the Companys products and to encourage greater product sales. These rebate programs include contracted rebates based on customers purchases made during an applicable monthly, quarterly or annual period. The provision for third-party rebates is estimated based on our customers contracted rebate programs and the Companys historical experience of rebates paid. Any significant changes to our customer rebate programs are considered in establishing the provision for rebates. The provisions for government rebates are based, in part, upon historical experience of claims submitted by the various states / authorities, contractual terms and government regulations. We monitor legislative changes to determine what impact such legislation may have on our provision.
Cash Discounts Cash discounts are provided to customers that pay within a specific period. The provision for cash discounts is estimated based upon invoice billings, utilizing historical customer payment experience. The Companys experience of payment history is fairly consistent and most customer payments qualify for the cash discount. Accordingly, our reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable.
Returns and Other Allowances The Companys provision for returns and other allowances include returns, pricing adjustments, promotional allowances, loyalty cards and billback adjustments.
Consistent with industry practice, the Company maintains a returns policy that allows customers to return product for a credit. In accordance with the Companys policy, credits for customer returns of products are applied against outstanding account activity or are settled in cash. Product exchanges are not permitted. Customer returns of product are generally not resalable. The Companys estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience and current trends of actual customer returns. Additionally, we consider other factors when estimating the current period returns provision, including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, as well as significant market changes which may impact future expected returns.
Pricing adjustments, which includes shelf stock adjustments, are credits issued to reflect price decreases in selling prices charged to the Companys direct customers. Shelf stock adjustments are based upon the amount of product our customers have in their inventory at the time of an agreed-upon price reduction. The provision for F-20 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) shelf stock adjustments is based upon specific terms with the Companys direct customers and includes estimates of existing customer inventory levels based upon their historical purchasing patterns. We regularly monitor all price changes to evaluate the Companys reserve balances. The adequacy of these reserves is readily determinable as pricing adjustments and shelf stock adjustments are negotiated and settled on a customer-by-customer basis.
Promotional allowances are credits that are issued in connection with a product launch or as an incentive for customers to carry our product. The Company establishes a reserve for promotional allowances based upon contractual terms.
Billback adjustments are credits that are issued to certain customers who purchase directly from us as well as indirectly through a wholesaler. These credits are issued in the event there is a difference between the customers direct and indirect contract price. The provision for billbacks is estimated based upon historical purchasing patterns of qualified customers who purchase product directly from us and supplement their purchases indirectly through our wholesale customers.
Loyalty cards allow the end user patients a discount per prescription and is accrued based on historical experience, contract terms and the volume of product and cards in the distribution channel.
The following table summarizes the activity in the Companys major categories of SRA (in millions): Chargebacks Rebates ReturnsandOther Allowances Cash Discounts Total Balance at December31, 2011 $ 160.9 $ 489.0 $ 122.0 $ 34.9 $ 806.8 Add: Actavis Group Acquisition 94.3 359.4 171.4 9.7 634.8 Provision related to sales in 2012 1,522.4 1,484.4 485.5 155.2 3,647.5 Credits and payments (1,566.1 ) (1,482.0 ) (429.4 ) (162.9 ) (3,640.4 ) Balance at December31, 2012 $ 211.5 $ 850.8 $ 349.5 $ 36.9 $ 1,448.7 Add: Warner Chilcott Acquisition 5.6 255.5 121.3 5.5 387.9 Less: Assets held for sale  (155.2 ) (3.3 ) (1.0 ) (159.5 ) Less: Actavis Acquisition measurement period adjustment  (31.0 )   (31.0 ) Provision related to sales in 2013 2,340.0 2,339.1 904.1 201.7 5,784.9 Credits and payments (2,310.7 ) (2,197.4 ) (753.7 ) (195.4 ) (5,457.2 ) Balance at December31, 2013 $ 246.4 $ 1,061.8 $ 617.9 $ 47.7 $ 1,973.8 Add: Forest Acquisition 27.9 425.0 94.3 9.8 557.0 Less: Warner Chilcott Acquisition measurement period adjustment  (34.3 ) (22.3 )  (56.6 ) Provision related to sales in 2014 4,591.7 3,323.9 859.4 350.7 9,125.7 Credits and payments (4,301.1 ) (3,029.8 ) (937.2 ) (347.5 ) (8,615.6 ) Balance at December31, 2014 $ 564.9 $ 1,746.6 $ 612.1 $ 60.7 $ 2,984.3 During the year ended December31, 2014, the Company lowered SRA balances relating to the valuation of assets and liabilities as part of the Warner Chilcott Acquisition measurement period adjustment by $56.6 million, with an offset to goodwill ($36.8million) and deferred tax liabilities ($19.8million).
F-21 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The provisions recorded to reduce gross product sales to net product sales were as follows ($ in millions): Year Ended December31, Gross ProductSales Chargebacks Rebates ReturnsandOther Allowances Cash Discounts Net ProductSales Gross-to-net Percentage 2012 $ 9,430.7 $ 1,522.4 $ 1,484.4 $ 485.5 $ 155.2 $ 5,783.2 61.3 % 2013 $ 14,276.7 $ 2,340.0 $ 2,339.1 $ 904.1 $ 201.7 $ 8,491.8 59.5 % 2014 $ 22,010.1 $ 4,591.7 $ 3,323.9 $ 859.4 $ 350.7 $ 12,884.4 58.5 % Included in the tables above are accounts receivable deductions within SRAs of $1,660.9 million and $1,254.8 million at December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. SRAs within accounts payable and accrued expenses were $1,323.4 million and $719.0million at December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
The movement in the percentage of provisions to gross sales is a result of changes in product mix, competition and channels of distribution. In the year ended December31, 2014, the Company increased sales of branded products, which lowered the provision percentage. Offsetting this, was the impact of increased generic competition on some of the Companys larger generic products which increased the rebates offered, as well as a higher portion of sales going through the wholesale channel, which has the impact of raising the rebate and chargeback percentages.
The Company does not expect future payments of SRA reserves to materially exceed our current estimates. However, if future SRA payments were to materially exceed our estimates, such adjustments may have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Branded Prescription Drug Fee On July28, 2014, the IRS issued a revised final rules and regulations for the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, an annual fee payable to the federal government based on an allocation of the Companys market share for branded prescription and authorized generic drugs sold to certain government programs compared to that of the industry. The final rules accelerated the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation from the year in which the fee is paid, to the year in which the market share used to allocate the fee is determined. This change required Actavis (and other industry participants) to recognize an additional year of expense in the third quarter of 2014 of $115.8 million, which is reflected in accrued liabilities and selling and marketing expense.
Litigation and Contingencies The Company is involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of its business, including product liability litigation, intellectual property litigation, employment litigation and other litigation. Additionally, the Company, in consultation with its counsel, assesses the need to record a liability for contingencies on a case-by-case basis in accordance with ASC Topic 450 Contingencies (ASC 450). Accruals are recorded when the Company determines that a loss related to a matter is both probable and reasonably estimable. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessment efforts progress or as additional information becomes available. Acquired contingencies in business combinations are recorded at fair value to the extent determinable, otherwise in accordance ASC 450.
R&D Activities R&D activities are expensed as incurred and consist of self-funded R&D costs, the costs associated with work performed under collaborative R&D agreements, regulatory fees, and milestone payments, if any.
Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the applicable tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided F-22 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include the Companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Companys effective tax rate on future earnings.
Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are derecognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. The Company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the consolidated statements of income as income tax expense.
Comprehensive (Loss) / Income Comprehensive (loss) / income includes all changes in equity during a period except those that resulted from investments by or distributions to the Companys stockholders. Other comprehensive (loss) / income refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are included in comprehensive (loss) / income, but excluded from net (loss) / income as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders equity. The Companys other comprehensive (loss) / income is comprised of unrealized gains / (losses) on certain holdings of publicly traded equity securities, investments in U.S. treasury and agency securities and actuarial gains/(losses), net of realized gains / (losses) included in net (loss) / income, net of tax and foreign currency translation adjustments.
Earnings Per Share (EPS) The Company accounts for EPS in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share (ASC 260) and related guidance, which requires two calculations of EPS to be disclosed: basic and diluted. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net (loss) / income by the weighted average common shares outstanding during a period. Diluted EPS is based on the treasury stock method and includes the effect from potential issuance of Ordinary Shares, such as shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units. Ordinary share equivalents have been excluded where their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
Our 2012 results included the Companys then current estimate of shares issuable to the former shareholders of the Actavis Group.The number of shares issuable was based upon year over year growth in Cash EBITDA, as defined, in correlation with the Actavis Group Acquisition. Based on the Companys then current estimate, the Company accounted for the issuance of 3.85million shares associated with contingent earn-out. On March28, 2013, based on further evaluation, the decision was made to award the remaining 1.65million contingent shares.
F-23 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of basic and diluted EPS consisted of the following (in millions, except per share amounts): Years Ended December31, 2014 2013 2012 EPSbasic Net (loss) / income attributable to ordinary shareholders $ (1,630.5 ) $ (750.4 ) $ 97.3 Basic weighted average ordinary shares outstanding 219.7 142.3 125.8 EPSbasic $ (7.42 ) $ (5.27 ) $ 0.77 EPSdiluted Net (loss) / income attributable to ordinary shareholders $ (1,630.5 ) $ (750.4 ) $ 97.3 Basic weighted average ordinary shares outstanding $ 219.7 142.3 125.8 Effect of dilutive securities: Dilutive stock awards   2.6 Dilutive weighted average ordinary shares outstanding 219.7 142.3 128.4 EPSdilutive $ (7.42 ) $ (5.27 ) $ 0.76 Stock awards to purchase / acquire 3.0million and 2.1million ordinary shares during the year ended December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were outstanding, but not included in the computation of diluted EPS, because the awards were anti-dilutive. There were no anti-dilutive shares for the year ended December31, 2012.
Employee Benefits Defined Contribution Plans The Company has defined contribution plans that are post-employment benefit plans under which the Company pays fixed contributions to a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to the defined contribution plans are recognized as an employee benefit expense in the consolidated statement of operations in the periods during which the related services were rendered.
Defined Benefit Plans The Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit plans as an asset or liability on its consolidated balance sheets. The obligations are generally measured at the actuarial present value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. The estimates of the obligation and related expense of these plans recorded in the financial statements are based on certain assumptions. The most significant assumptions relate to discount rate and expected return on plan assets. Other assumptions used may include employee demographic factors such as compensation rate increases, retirement patterns, expected employee turnover and participant mortality rates. The difference between these assumptions and actual experience results in the recognition of an asset or liability based upon a net actuarial (gain) / loss. If the total net actuarial (gain) / loss included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) / income exceeds a threshold of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets, it is subject to amortization and recorded as a component of net periodic pension cost over the average remaining service lives of the employees participating in the pension plan. Net periodic benefit costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations.
F-24 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Share-based Compensation The Company has adopted several equity award plans which authorize the granting of options, restricted shares, restricted stock units and other forms of equity awards of the Companys ordinary shares, subject to certain conditions.
The Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors (the Board) authorized and issued restricted stock and restricted stock units and non-qualified options to the Companys employees, including its executive officers and certain non-employee directors (the Participants) under the Companys equity compensation plans.
The company grants awards with the following features:  Time based vesting restricted stock awards  Performance based restricted stock awards measured to the EBITDA, as defined, of the Company or other performance based targets defined by the Company  Performance based restricted stock awards measured to the Total Stockholders Return, compared to pre-defined metrics  Non-qualified options to purchase outstanding shares  Cash settled awards classified as a liability The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense for the granted awards over the applicable vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. Estimates of anticipated vesting of awards are revised in future periods based on actual forfeiture rates and targets achieved. Such revisions may have a material impact on the results of operations.
Restructuring Costs The Company records liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities in the period in which the liability is incurred. In accordance with existing benefit arrangements, employee severance costs are accrued when the restructuring actions are probable and estimable. Costs for one-time termination benefits in which the employee is required to render service until termination in order to receive the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period. The Company also incurs costs with contract terminations and costs of transferring products as part of restructuring activities. Refer to NOTE 21  Business Restructuring Charges for more information.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.2014-08 Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity. Under the new guidance, a disposal of a component of an entity or group of components of an entity that represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on operations and financial results is a discontinued operation when any of the following occurs: (i)it meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, (ii)it is disposed of by sale, or (iii)it is disposed of other than by sale. Also, a business that, on acquisition, meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale is reported in discontinued operations. Additionally, the new guidance requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations, as well as disclosure of the pre-tax profit or loss attributable to a disposal of an individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations presentation. The guidance is effective prospectively for all disposals (or classifications as held for sale) of components of an entity and all businesses that, on acquisition, are classified as held for sale, that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December15, 2014, and interim periods within those years. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position as of December31, 2014 or results of operations for the year ended December31, 2014, however future transactions may be impacted.
F-25 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606 (ASU 2014-09) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The issuance of these documents completes the joint effort by the FASB and the IASB to improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for GAAP and IFRS. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts). ASU 2014-09 will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. ASU 2014-09 also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition  Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. In addition, the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer (e.g., assets within the scope of Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, and intangible assets within the scope of Topic 350, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other) are amended to be consistent with the guidance on recognition and measurement (including the constraint on revenue) in this ASU.
The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, this pronouncement will have on future financial positions and results of operations.
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.2014-12 Compensation  Stock Compensation (Topic 718). This guidance clarifies the accounting for share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. In this case, the performance target would be required to be treated as a performance condition, and should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. The guidance also addresses when to recognize the related compensation cost. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December15, 2015. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, this pronouncement will have on future financial positions and results of operations.
In November 2014, the FASB ASU No.2014-16 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Pushdown Accounting a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force. The issued guidance provides an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. An acquired entity may elect the option to apply pushdown accounting in the reporting period in which the change-in-control event occurs. An acquired entity should determine whether to elect to apply pushdown accounting for each individual change-in-control event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. If pushdown accounting is not applied in the reporting period in which the change-in-control event occurs, an acquired entity will have the option to elect to apply pushdown accounting in a subsequent reporting period to the acquired entitys most recent change-in-control event. An election to apply pushdown accounting in a reporting period after the reporting period in which the change-in-control event occurred should be considered a change in accounting principle. If pushdown accounting is applied to an individual change-in-control event, that election is irrevocable. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position as of December31, 2014 or results of operations for the year ended December31, 2014.
F-26 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) NOTE5  Business Development During the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company acquired material assets and businesses. The pro forma results of the businesses acquired that materially impacted the reported results of the Company are as follows (unaudited; $ in millions except per share information): Year Ended December31, 2014 Asreported Forest Acquisition Pro Forma Net Revenue $ 13,062.3 $ 2,307.8 $ 15,370.1 Net (loss)/income attributable to ordinary shareholders $ (1,630.5 ) $ 142.4 $ (1,488.1 ) (Loss) per share Basic $ (7.42 ) $ (5.62 ) Diluted $ (7.42 ) $ (5.62 ) Year Ended December 31, 2013 Asreported Forest Acquisition WarnerChilcott Acquisition Pro Forma Net Revenue $ 8,677.6 $ 4,042.6 $ 1,790.6 $ 14,510.8 Net (loss)/income attributable to ordinary shareholders $ (750.4 ) $ (2,307.7 ) $ 506.2 $ (2,551.9 ) (Loss) per share Basic $ (5.27 ) $ (9.73 ) Diluted $ (5.27 ) $ (9.73 ) Year Ended December 31, 2012 Asreported WarnerChilcott Acquisition Actavis Acquisition Pro Forma Net Revenue $ 5,914.9 $ 2,525.1 $ 2,115.3 $ 10,555.3 Net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders $ 97.3 $ (159.2 ) $ (383.5 ) $ (445.4 ) Earnings/(Loss) per share Basic $ 0.77 $ (2.68 ) Diluted $ 0.76 $ (2.68 ) 2014 Significant Business Developments During 2014, we entered into the following business development transactions that impacted our results of operations and will continue to have an impact on our future operations.
Allergan Acquisition On November17, 2014, Actavis plc and Allergan announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Actavis plc will acquire Allergan for a combination of $129.22 in cash and 0.3683 of an ordinary share of Actavis plc for each share of Allergan common stock (the Pending Allergan Acquisition). Based on the closing price of Actavis ordinary shares on November14, 2014, the transaction was valued at approximately $66.0 billion. The addition of Allergans therapeutic franchises in ophthalmology, neurosciences and medical aesthetics/dermatology/plastic surgery will complement Actavis existing central nervous system, gastroenterology, womens health and urology franchises. The combined company will also benefit significantly from Allergans global brand equity and consumer awareness of key products, including Botox  and Restasis  . The transaction also expands our presence, market and product reach across many international markets, with F-27 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) strengthened commercial positions across Canada, Europe, Southeast Asia and other high-value growth markets, including China, India, the Middle East and Latin America. The transaction is expected to close late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2015.
Pharmatech As part of the Forest Acquisition, the Company acquired certain manufacturing plants and contract manufacturing agreements within our Aptalis Pharmaceutical Technologies (Pharmatech) entities. In accordance with acquisition accounting, the assets were fair valued on July1, 2014 as assets held in use, including market participant synergies anticipated under the concept of highest and best use. During the fourth quarter, the decision was made to hold these assets for sale as one complete unit, without integrating the unit and realizing anticipated synergies. In the quarter ended December31, 2014, the Company recognized an impairment on assets held for sale of $189.9 million (the Pharmatech Transaction) which included a portion of goodwill allocated to this business unit. On February 13, 2015, the Company and TPG, a global private investment firm, announced that they have entered into definitive agreement under which Actavis will divest Pharmatech to TPG.
Durata Therapeutics Acquisition On November17, 2014, the Company completed its tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Durata Therapeutics, Inc. (Durata), an innovative pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for patients with infectious diseases and acute illnesses (the Durata Acquisition). Actavis purchased all outstanding shares of Durata, which were valued at approximately $724.5 million, including the assumption of debt. Additionally, there is one contingent value right (CVR) per share, entitling the holder to receive additional cash payments of up to $5.00 per CVR if certain regulatory or commercial milestones related to Duratas lead product Dalvance are achieved. The CVR had an acquisition date fair value of $49.0 million.
Recognition and Measurement of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed at Fair Value The Durata Acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2014, certain amounts relating to the valuation of tax related matters have not been finalized. The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date: (inmillions) Amount Cash and cash equivalents $ 17.8 Inventory 21.0 IPR&D intangible assets 249.0 Intangible assets 480.0 Goodwill 71.6 Other assets and liabilities (26.0 ) Contingent Consideration (49.0 ) Deferred tax liabilities, net (39.9 ) Outstanding indebtedness (67.0 ) Net assets acquired $ 657.5 IPR&D and Intangible Assets IPR&D intangible assets represent the value assigned to acquired R&D projects that, as of the acquisition date, had not established technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The IPR&D intangible assets are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets and will be subject to impairment testing F-28 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) until completion or abandonment of the projects. Upon successful completion of each project and launch of the product, the Company will make a separate determination of the estimated useful life of the IPR&D intangible asset and the related amortization will be recorded as an expense over the estimated useful life (IPR&D Acquisition Accounting).
The estimated fair value of the IPR&D and identifiable intangible assets was determined using the income approach, which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of those asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product (including net revenues, cost of sales, R&D costs, selling and marketing costs and working capital/asset contributory asset charges), the appropriate discount rate to select in order to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each assets life cycle, the potential regulatory and commercial success risks, competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream as well as other factors (the IPR&D and Intangible Asset Valuation Technique).
The fair value of the IPR&D and CMP intangible assets was determined using the IPR&D and Intangible Asset Valuation Technique. The discount rate used to arrive at the present value of CMPs was 9.5% and for IPR&D intangible assets was 10.5% to reflect the internal rate of return and incremental commercial uncertainty in the cash flow projections. No assurances can be given that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will not change. For these and other reasons, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results.
Goodwill Goodwill resulting from the Durata Acquisition is assigned to our North American Brands segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. Among the primary reasons the Company acquired Durata and the factors that contributed to the recognition of goodwill is the strategic fit of Dalvance TM into our specialty brand portfolio.
Contingent Consideration Additional consideration is conditionally due to the seller based upon the approval of Dalvance TM in Europe, the approval of a single dose indication and the product reaching certain sales milestones. The Company estimated the acquisition accounting fair value of the contingent consideration to be $49.0 million using a probability weighting approach that considered the possible outcomes based on assumptions related to the timing and probability of the product launch date, discount rates matched to the timing of the payment, and probability of success rates and discount adjustments on the related cash flows.
Long-Term Deferred Tax Liabilities and Other Tax Liabilities Long-term deferred tax liabilities and other tax liabilities result from identifiable intangible assets fair value adjustments. These adjustments create excess book basis over the tax basis which is multiplied by the statutory tax rate for the jurisdiction in which the deferred taxes exist.
Rhythm On October22, 2014, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with the exclusive option to acquire Rhythm Health, Inc.

Contingent Consideration Additional consideration is conditionally due to the seller upon the achievement of certain milestones in respect to the development and commercialization of the products as well as reaching certain sales targets. The Company estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration to be $43.4 million using a probability weighting approach that considered the possible outcomes based on assumptions related to the timing and probability of the product launch date, discount rates matched to the timing of first payment, and probability of success rates and discount adjustments on the related cash flows.
At June30, 2014, after an identified triggering event, the acquired IPR&D intangible asset related to Estelle, a novel natural estrogen-based 28 day cycle oral contraceptive for the prevention of pregnancy, of $13.1 million was deemed to be fully impaired. Consequently, the $22.8 million contingent liability related to Estelle was F-41 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) written off, resulting in a net gain of $9.7 million. At June30, 2014, after an identified triggering event, the acquired IPR&D intangible asset related to Colvir, a treatment of premalignant Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) lesions of the uterine, of $2.0 million was deemed to be fully impaired. Consequently the $1.5 million contingent liability was also written off, resulting in a net loss of $0.5 million.
Long-Term Deferred Tax Liabilities and Other Tax Liabilities Long-term deferred tax liabilities and other tax liabilities result from identifiable intangible assets fair value adjustments. These adjustments create excess book basis over the tax basis which is multiplied by the statutory tax rate for the jurisdiction in which the deferred taxes exist.
2012 and Prior Significant Business Developments During 2012 and prior, we completed and / or initiated the following transactions that impacted our results of operations and will continue to have an impact on our future operations.
Acquisition of Actavis Group On October31, 2012, we completed the Actavis Group Acquisition. Actavis Group was a privately held generic pharmaceutical company specializing in the development, manufacture and sale of generic pharmaceuticals. The Company funded the cash portion of the transaction through a combination of term loan borrowings and senior unsecured notes. For additional information, refer to Note16  Long-Term Debt and Leases.
Inventories The fair value of inventories acquired included a step-up in the value of inventories of approximately $137.3 million. In the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012, the Company recognized $93.5 million and $44.1 million, respectively, as a component of cost of sales as the inventory acquired was sold to the Companys customers.
Contingent Consideration At December31, 2012, the Company estimated the Actavis Group earn-out to be 3.85million shares, or $329.2 million, which was recognized on the date of acquisition. On March28, 2013, based on further evaluation, the decision was made to award the remaining 1.65million contingent shares. Accordingly, during the year ended December31, 2013, the Company recorded an expense of $150.3 million for contingent consideration as a result of the decision to award all remaining contingent shares.
Divested Products In order to obtain regulatory clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino, in connection with the Actavis Group Acquisition, the Company was required to divest certain assets. On October31, 2012, a total of 22 generic pharmaceutical products owned by either Actavis Group or Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. were sold to Par Pharmaceuticals Companies, Inc. and Sandoz, Inc., which resulted in a gain of $24.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. The divested products consisted of both commercial and development stage products in a number of therapeutic categories where the two companies owned overlapping products. Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s net sales of divested products were $18.5 million for the year ended December31, 2012. Actavis Groups net sales of divested products were $60.8 million for the year ended December31, 2012. The sale of the Actavis Group divested products did not have an impact on our net revenues as these amounts were not included in the results of operations of the Company for the period. For the year ended December31, 2012, no one product accounted for more than one percent of the Companys consolidated net revenues.

F-45 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) NOTE 8  Share-Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based compensation awards made to employees and directors based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant. A summary of the Companys share-based compensation plans is presented below.
Equity Award Plans The Company has adopted several equity award plans which authorize the granting of options, restricted shares, restricted stock units and other forms of equity awards of the Companys ordinary shares, subject to certain conditions. The Compensation Committee of the Companys Board authorized 281.1million shares for issuance under the Companys equity compensation plans.
The Company grants awards with the following features:  Time based vesting restricted stock awards  Performance based restricted stock awards measured to the EBITDA, as defined, of the Company or other performance based targets defined by the Company  Performance based restricted stock awards measured to the Total Stockholders Return, compared to pre-defined metrics  Non-qualified options to purchase outstanding shares  Cash settled awards recorded as a liability Option award plans require options to be granted at the fair value of the shares underlying the options at the date of the grant and generally become exercisable over periods ranging from three to five years. Each option granted expires ten years from the date of grant. Restricted stock awards are grants that entitle the holder to ordinary shares, subject to certain terms. Restricted stock unit awards are grants that entitle the holder the right to receive an ordinary share, subject to certain terms. Restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards (both time-based vesting and performance-based vesting) generally have restrictions eliminated over a one to four year vesting period. Restrictions generally lapse for non-employee directors after one year. Certain restricted stock units are performance-based awards issued at a target number with the actual number of restricted shares issued ranging based on achievement of the performance criteria.
F-46 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Fair Value Assumptions All restricted stock and restricted stock units (whether time-based vesting or performance-based vesting), are granted and expensed, using the fair value per share on the applicable grant date, over the applicable vesting period. Non-qualified options to purchase ordinary shares are granted to employees at exercise prices per share equal to the closing market price per share on the date of grant. The fair value of non-qualified options is determined on the applicable grant dates using the Black-Scholes method of valuation and that amount is recognized as an expense over the vesting period. Using the Black-Scholes valuation model, the fair value of options is based on the following assumptions: 2014 Grants 2014Acquired Awards 2013 Grants 2013Acquired Awards Dividend yield 0 % 0% 0 % 0% Expected volatility 29.0 % 28.0% 20.3 % 25.5% Risk-free interest rate 1.9-2.2 % 0-2.1% 1.31 1.0-2.0% Expected term (years) 7.5 upto6.4 7.0 3.8-6.4 Share-Based Compensation Expense Share-based compensation expense recognized in the Companys results of operations for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was as follows: Years Ended December31, 2014 2013 2012 Equity based compensation awards $ 368.0 $ 132.1 $ 48.1 Non equity-settled awards in connection with the Furiex Acquisition 16.6   Non equity-settled awards in connection with the Durata Acquisition 16.6   Non equity-settled awards other  1.5 0.7 Total stock-based compensation expense $ 401.2 $ 133.6 $ 48.8 In the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 the related tax benefits were $145.7 million, $44.4 million and $17.7 million, respectively relating to stock-based compensation.

NOTE 9 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Defined Benefit Plan Obligations The Company has numerous defined benefit plans offered to employees around the world. For these plans, retirement benefits are generally based on an employees years of service and compensation. Funding requirements are determined on an individual country and plan basis and are subject to local country practices and market circumstances.
F-48 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Net periodic benefit cost of the defined benefit plans was deminimis in the year ended December31, 2012.

Employee benefit plan obligations are recognized and measured in accordance with the existing authoritative literature for accounting for benefit plans rather than at fair value. Accordingly, the Company remeasured the benefit plans acquired as part of its acquisitions and recognized an asset or liability for the funded status of these plans as of the respective acquisition dates.
Benefit obligation and asset data for the defined benefit plans, were as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2014 (1) 2013 (2) Change in Plan Assets Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 179.3 $ 67.2 Fair value of plan assets assumed in the Forest Acquisition 11.4  Fair value of plan assets assumed in the Warner Chilcott Acquisition  79.1 Other business development related activity (4.7 ) 13.3 Other contributions 1.4 1.9 Other (2.1 ) 4.5 Employer contribution 13.9 8.4 Return on plan assets 20.0 7.1 Benefits paid (6.5 ) (4.4 ) Effects of exchange rate changes (16.5 ) 2.2 Fair value of plan assets at end of year $ 196.2 $ 179.3 F-49 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2014 (1) 2013 (2) Change in Benefit Obligation Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 231.2 $ 90.9 Benefit obligation assumed in the Forest Acquisition 19.3  Benefit obligation assumed in the Warner Chilcott Acquisition  97.5 Other business development related activity (0.6 ) 30.2 Contributions 1.4 2.0 Service cost 7.0 7.0 Interest cost 9.6 6.0 Actuarial loss/(gain) 54.6 (1.1 ) Other (1.6 )  Curtailments (4.0 )  Benefit paid (6.6 ) (5.5 ) Effects of exchange rate changes (24.2 ) 4.2 Benefit obligation at end of year 286.1 231.2 Funded status at end of year $ (89.9 ) $ (51.9 ) (1) The year ended December31, 2014 includes benefit obligation and asset data from the Forest Plans following the Forest Acquisition on July1, 2014.

In certain countries, there are no legal requirements or financial incentives provided to companies to pre-fund pension obligations. In these instances, benefit payments are typically paid directly by the Company as they become due.
F-50 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Plan Assets Companies are required to use a fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurement, (ASC 820) which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs used to measure fair value with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest: Level1Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level2Observable inputs other than Level1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level3Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. The Level 3 assets are those whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques with significant unobservable inputs, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.
If the inputs used to measure the financial assets fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.
The fair values of the Companys pension plan assets at December31, 2014 by asset category are as follows: (in millions) QuotedPrices In Active Markets for IdenticalAssets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Assets Investment funds Equity securities $ 74.3 $  $  $ 74.3 Debt securities 93.2   93.2 Other investments Other 3.1 25.6  28.7 Total Assets $ 170.6 $ 25.6 $  $ 196.2 The fair values of the Companys pension plan assets at December31, 2013 by asset category are as follows: (in millions) QuotedPrices In Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Assets Investment funds Non-U.S. developed markets equities $ 70.3 $  $  $ 70.3 Fixed income obligations 83.6   83.6 Other investments    Other  25.4  25.4 Total Assets $ 153.9 $ 25.4 $  $ 179.3 F-51 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The assets of the pension plan are held in separately administered trusts. The investment guidelines for the Companys pension plans is to create an asset allocation that is expected to deliver a rate of return sufficient to meet the long-term obligation of the plan, given an acceptable level of risk. The target investment portfolio of the Companys pension plans is allocated as follows: Target Allocation As of December 31, 2014 (1) 2013 (2) Bonds 49 % 47 % Equity securities 40 % 39 % Other investments 11 % 14 % (1) Includes the asset allocation of the Forest Plans following the Forest Acquisition on July1, 2014.
(2) Includes the asset allocation of the Warner Chilcott Plans following the Warner Chilcott Acquisition on October1, 2013.
Expected Contributions Employer contributions to the pension plan during the year ending December31, 2015 are expected to be $9.8million.
Expected Benefit Payments Total expected benefit payments for the Companys pension plans are as follows (in millions): 2015 $ 7.3 2016 8.5 2017 8.4 2018 9.4 2019 11.0 Thereafter 241.5 Total Liability $ 286.1 Expected benefit payments are based on the same assumptions used to measure the benefit obligations and include estimated future employee service. The majority of the payments will be paid from plan assets and not Company assets.
Amounts Recognized in Other Comprehensive (Loss)/Income Net loss amounts reflect experience differentials primarily relating to differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions. Net loss amounts in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net pension cost over the average remaining service life of employees. Balances recognized within accumulated other comprehensive (loss) / income that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs are as follows (in millions): DefinedBenefit Balance as of December31, 2013 $ 5.6 Net actuarial loss (36.4 ) Balance as of December31, 2014 $ (30.8 ) F-52 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Information for defined benefit plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets is presented below (in millions): Defined Benefit As of December31, 2014 2013 Projected benefit obligations $ 286.1 $ 231.2 Accumulated benefit obligations $ 262.6 $ 214.4 Plan assets $ 196.2 $ 179.3 Actuarial Assumptions The weighted average assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligations of the Companys defined benefit plans are as follows: AsofDecember31, 2014 2013 Discount rate 2.9 % 3.9 % Salary growth rate 3.7 % 3.8 % The weighted average assumptions used to calculate the net periodic benefit cost of the Companys defined benefit plans are as follows: AsofDecember31, 2014 2013 Discount Rate 3.9 % 3.8 % Expected rate of return on plan assets 4.9 % 3.3 % Salary growth rate 3.7 % 2.5 % In order to select a discount rate for purposes of valuing the plan obligations the Company uses market returns and adjusts them as needed to fit the estimated duration of the plan liabilities.
The expected rate of return represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, long-term historical returns data are considered as well as actual returns on the plan assets and other capital markets experience. Using this reference information, the long-term return expectations for each asset category and a weighted average expected return was developed, according to the allocation among those investment categories.

Also impacting the year ended December31, 2014 was the addition to goodwill relating to the Furiex Acquisition of $251.9 million, the Tretin-X acquisition of $32.0 million, the Durata Acquisition of $71.6million and the Silom Acquisition of $20.0 million. The acquisitions were offset, in part, by the reduction of goodwill relating to the adjustments to SRA reserves and the applicable deferred taxes in connection with the Warner Chilcott Acquisition of $36.8 million, the Lincolnton divestiture of $2.2 million and a goodwill impairment of $17.3 million related to the Pharmatech Transaction. On February 5, 2015, the Company announced the sale of its respiratory business to AstraZeneca for consideration of $600.0 million upon closing and low single-digit royalties above a certain revenue threshold. AstraZeneca will also pay Actavis an additional $100.0 million, and Actavis has agreed to a number of contractual consents and approvals, including certain amendments to the ongoing collaboration agreements between AstraZeneca and Actavis. As part of this transaction, the Company held for sale goodwill of $309.1 million as of December 31, 2014.
During the second quarter of 2014, the Company performed its annual impairment assessment of goodwill, IPR&D and trade name intangibles assets with indefinite-lives. The Company determined there was no impairment associated with goodwill or trade name intangible assets as of June 30, 2014.
During the 2013 integration of the Actavis Group with the Watson business, the Company reorganized its organizational structure and management performance reporting, which was further reorganized in 2014. Previously, the reporting units within our then current Actavis Pharma operating segment was organized as follows: Americas (The United States of America (U.S.), Canada, Latin America), Europe (Europe, Russia, Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and Turkey), and MEAAP (Middle East, Africa, Australia, and Asia Pacific). These reporting units combined the Watson and Actavis Group businesses. Previously, goodwill for the Watsons Global Generics operating segment was tested as one unit. The combination of the Watson and the Actavis Group business and net assets in the European reporting unit, combined with other market factors, led to the impairment of the goodwill associated with this reporting unit.
During the second quarter of 2013, concurrent with the availability of discrete financial information for our new reporting units, the Company completed an extensive review of its operating businesses, including exploring options for addressing overall profitability of seven Western European commercial operations consisting of, F-60 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) among other things, restructuring their operations, refocusing their activities on specific sub-markets, as well as potential divestitures of such businesses to other third parties.The potential impact of these conditions were considered in the Companys projections when determining the indicated fair value of its then current reporting units for the impairment tests that were performed during the second quarter of 2013. Upon completion of step one of the impairment analysis for each of the Companys reporting units, it was concluded the fair value of the then current Actavis Pharma  Europe reporting unit was below its carrying value including goodwill. This was primarily related to the integration of our Arrow Group (acquired on December2, 2009, in exchange for cash consideration of $1.05billion, approximately 16.9million shares of the Companys Restricted Ordinary Shares and 200,000shares of the Companys Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock and certain contingent consideration (the Arrow Group Acquisition)) with the Actavis Group in Europe. The fair value of the Companys reporting units was estimated based on a discounted cash flow model using managements business plans and projections as the basis for expected future cash flows for approximately five years and residual growth rates ranging from 2% to 4% thereafter. Management believes that the assumptions it used for the impairment tests performed are consistent with those that would be utilized by a market participant in performing similar valuations of its reporting units. A separate discount rate was utilized for each reporting unit that was derived from published sources and, on a weighted average basis, a discount rate of 8% was utilized using the Companys weighted average cost of capital, which considered the overall inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return a market participant would expect. As a result of completing step two of the Companys impairment analysis, the Company recorded an impairment of the then current Actavis Pharma  Europe reporting unit of $647.5 million, representing primarily all the goodwill allocated to this reporting unit, in the year ended December31, 2013.

The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. The resultant probability-weighted cash flows are discounted using an appropriate effective annual interest rate to reflect the internal rate of return and incremental commercial uncertainty, major risks and uncertainties associated with the successful completion of the projects triggering the contingent obligation. At each reporting date, the Company revalues the contingent consideration obligation to estimated fair value and F-72 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) records changes in fair value as income or expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations may result from changes in discount periods and rates, changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various contingent consideration obligations. Accretion expense related to the increase in the net present value of the contingent liability is included in operating income for the period.

Continued qualification for the tax ruling is subject to certain requirements. The tax ruling is effective through 2024.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at the applicable tax rates. The significant components of the Companys net deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): December 31, 2014 2013 Benefits from net operating and capital losses and tax credit carryfowards $ 1,560.3 $ 1,121.2 Differences in financial statement and tax accounting for: Inventories, receivables and accruals 695.4 473.7 Share-based compensation 222.5 33.1 Other 57.6 2.3 Total deferred tax asset, gross $ 2,535.8 $ 1,630.3 Less: Valuation allowance (1,077.9 ) (900.7 ) Total deferred tax asset, net $ 1,457.9 $ 729.6 Differences in financial statement and tax accounting for: Property, equipment and intangible assets (2,849.7 ) (961.8 ) Investment in subsidiaries (951.6 ) (7.5 ) Basis difference in debt (158.1 ) (281.7 ) Total deferred tax liabilities $ (3,959.4 ) $ (1,251.0 ) Total deferred taxes $ (2,501.5 ) $ (521.4 ) For the year ended December 31, 2014, the total net deferred tax liability increased by $2,744.3 million due to current year acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the total net deferred tax liability increased by $123.1 million due to current year acquisitions.
The Company had the following carryforward tax attributes at December31, 2014:  $2,184.8 million U.S. capital loss which will expire in 2018;  $603.3 million U.S. federal net operating losses (NOL) and other tax attributes which are expected to be utilized within the carryforward period;  $193.2 million U.S. tax credits, of which $98.7 million is not expected to be utilized within the carryforward period;  $27.1 million U.S. state tax NOLs which begin to expire in 2015;  $1,124.2 million non-U.S. tax NOLs which begin to expire in 2015 and $631.2 million non-U.S. tax NOLs which are not subject to expiration;  $27.0 million non-U.S. tax credits which begin to expire in 2015 and $54.1 million non-U.S. tax credits which are not subject to expiration.
Net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of $489.7 million and $183.7 million, respectively, are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382. All of the net operating losses and $85.0 million of the tax credits are expected to be realized.
A valuation allowance has been established due to the uncertainty of realizing a capital loss carryforward ($764.7 million), certain net operating losses ($129.7 million), tax credits ($122.4 million) and other deferred tax assets ($61.1 million).
F-75 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) As of December 31, 2014, deferred income taxes have not been provided on approximately $1,204.9 million of undistributed earnings of certain non-Irish subsidiaries as these amounts are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in non-Irish operations. It is not practicable to calculate the deferred taxes associated with these earnings because of the variability of multiple factors that would need to be assessed at the time of any assumed repatriation. In making this assertion, the Company evaluates, among other factors, the profitability of its Irish and non-Irish operations and the need for cash within and outside Ireland, including cash requirements for capital improvement, acquisitions and market expansion. Additionally, the Company has accrued income taxes, including withholding taxes, of approximately $951.6 million for certain pre-acquisition earnings primarily related to the Forest acquisition. The Company expects that future subsidiary earnings will be indefinitely reinvested.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes At December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the liability for income tax associated with uncertain tax positions was $846.2 million, $232.8million and $103.7million, respectively. As of December31, 2014, the Company estimates that this liability would be reduced by $80.5 million from offsetting tax benefits associated with the effects of state income taxes and net operating losses with valuation allowances. The net amount of $765.7 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the Companys effective tax rate. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions): December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Balance at the beginning of the year $ 232.8 $ 103.7 $ 71.2 Increases for current year tax positions 59.0 54.3 4.3 Increases for prior year tax positions 15.4 53.0 6.7 Increases due to acquisitions 571.2 85.9 41.9 Decreases for prior year tax positions (31.4 ) (17.8 ) (10.4 ) Settlements (1.9 ) (42.7 ) (9.3 ) Lapse of applicable statue of limitations (1.1 ) (5.3 ) (1.3 ) Foreign Exchange 2.2 1.7 0.6 Balance at the end of the year $ 846.2 $ 232.8 $ 103.7 The Companys continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in tax expense. During the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company recognized approximately $8.6 million, $2.1million and $1.3million in interest and penalties, respectively. At December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company had accrued $68.0 million (net of tax benefit of $35.5million), $9.9million (net of tax benefit of $4.3million) and $9.5million (net of tax benefit of $4.4million) of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, respectively.Although the company cannot determine the impact with certainty, it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits may change by up to $36.0 million within the next twelve months.
The Company conducts business globally and, as a result, it files federal, state and foreign tax returns. The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time. While the Company has accrued for amounts it believes are the probable outcomes, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal. The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation, regulations or case law. Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions.
F-76 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) With the exception of the newly acquired Forest group, the Company is generally no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2008. For the Companys 2008-2009 tax years, the IRS has agreed on all issues except the timing of the deductibility of certain litigation costs. Due to our numerous acquisitions we have several concurrent IRS tax audits for pre-acquisition periods. The table set forth below lists the acquired U.S. entities and taxable years that are currently under audit by the IRS: IRS Audits Tax Years Actavis Inc.
2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 Warner Chilcott Corporation 2010, 2011 and 2012 Forest Laboratories, Inc.

2013 Durata Therapeutics Inc.
2012 While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, the Company has accrued for amounts it believes are the likely outcomes at this time.
The Warner Chilcott U.S. operating entities entered into an Advanced Pricing Agreement (APA) with the IRS that specifies the agreed upon terms under which the Warner Chilcott U.S. entities are compensated for distribution and service transactions between the Warner Chilcott U.S. entities and the Warner Chilcott non-U.S. entities, effective for 2011 through 2017. On December17, 2013, Warner Chilcott UK Limited signed an APA with the United Kingdom tax authorities that specifies the agreed upon terms under which Warner Chilcott UK Limited is compensated for the purchase of certain finished pharmaceutical products by Warner Chilcott U.K. from various Warner Chilcott non-U.K. entities related to the distribution of these products in the U.K. for calendar years 2013 through 2017 with a rollback covering 2010 through 2012. These APAs provide the Company with greater certainty with respect to the mix of its pretax income in certain of the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates and is applicable to the Companys Warner Chilcott U.S. and U.K. operations. The Company believes that its transfer pricing arrangements comply with existing U.S. and non-U.S. tax rules.
NOTE19 Stockholders Equity Share Repurchases During the year ended December31, 2014, the Company approved the cancellation of its then outstanding treasury shares. The Company has approved the cancellation of future shares repurchased and currently does not intend to hold shares repurchased by the Company in treasury shares. The financial statement impact resulting from this transaction was a reclassification from treasury stock to additional paid-in-capital.
During the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013, the Company repurchased approximately 0.6million and 1.2million of its Ordinary Shares surrendered to the Company to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the exercise and sale of stock options or vesting of restricted stock issued to employees for total consideration of $130.1million and $170.0million, respectively.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) / Income For most of the Companys international operations, the local currency has been determined to be the functional currency. The results of its non-U.S. dollar based operations are translated to U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates during the period. Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet date. Equity is translated at the prevailing rate of exchange at the date of the equity transaction. Translation adjustments are reflected in stockholders equity and are included as a component of other comprehensive (loss) / income. The effects of converting non-functional currency assets and liabilities into the functional currency are recorded as general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

The North American Brands segment includes patent-protected and off-patent products that the Company sells and markets as brand pharmaceutical products within North America. The North American Generics and International segment includes certain trademarked off-patent products that the Company sells and markets as off-patent pharmaceutical products that are therapeutically equivalent to proprietary products within North America. Also included in this segment are international revenues which include patent-protected and off-patent products that the Company sells and markets as brand pharmaceutical products, certain trademarked off-patent products that the Company sells and markets as off-patent pharmaceutical products that are therapeutically equivalent to proprietary products, over the counter products and revenues from our third-party Medis business. The Anda Distribution segment distributes generic and brand pharmaceutical products manufactured by third parties, as well as by the Company, primarily to independent pharmacies, pharmacy chains, pharmacy buying groups and physicians offices. The Anda Distribution segment operating results exclude sales of products developed, acquired, or licensed by the North American Brands and North American Generics and International segments.
The Company evaluates segment performance based on segment contribution. Segment contribution for North American Brands, North American Generics and International, and Anda Distribution represents segment net revenues less cost of sales (excluding amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles including product rights), selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses.

NOTE 22  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities The Companys revenue, earnings, cash flows and fair value of its assets and liabilities can be impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange risks and interest rates, as applicable. The Company manages the impact of foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements through operational means and through the use of various financial instruments, including derivative instruments such as foreign currency contracts.
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts The Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate volatility in anticipated foreign currency cash flows resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily associated with non-functional currency denominated revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries. The foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at December31, 2014 have settlement dates within one month. The effect of the derivative contracts was a gain of $2.3 million, a loss of $0.3 million and a loss of $70.4 million for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and was recognized in other income (expense). The forward contracts are classified in the consolidated balance sheet in prepaid expenses and other assets or accounts F-84 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) payable and accrued expenses, as applicable. In 2012, the Company entered into foreign currency exchange options and forward contracts to hedge its agreed upon purchase of the Actavis Group for 4.25 billion. The foreign currency options had a net premium payable of $156.8 million, which was settled and paid on October9, 2012. These transactions were entered into to mitigate exposure resulting from movements of the U.S. dollar against the Euro in connection with the Actavis Acquisition, and resulted in a (loss) being reflected in other income (expense) of $70.4 million during the year ended December31, 2012.
The foreign currency forward contracts to buy Euros and US dollars and sell Russian Rubles at December31, 2014 were as follows: NotionalAmount Foreign Currency Buy Sell Russian Ruble    0.8    0.8 NOTE23 Fair Value Measurement Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair values determined based on Level1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair values determined based on Level2 inputs utilize observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and observable quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not very active. Fair values determined based on Level3 inputs utilize unobservable inputs and include valuations of assets or liabilities for which there is little, if any, market activity. A financial asset or liabilitys classification within the above hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis as of December31, 2014 and 2013 consisted of the following (in millions): Fair Value Measurements as of December 31, 2014 using: Total Level1 Level2 Level 3 Assets: Marketable securities $ 1.0 $ 1.0 $  $  Foreign exchange forward contracts 2.3  2.3  Total assets $ 3.3 $ 1.0 $ 2.3 $  Liabilities: Contingent consideration 396.8   396.8 Total liabilities $ 396.8 $  $  $ 396.8 F-85 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Fair Value Measurements as of December31, 2013 using: Total Level1 Level2 Level 3 Assets: Marketable securities $ 2.5 $ 2.5 $  $  Foreign exchange forward contracts 0.3  0.3  Total assets $ 2.8 $ 2.5 $ 0.3 $  Liabilities: Contingent consideration 214.7 6.9  207.8 Total liabilities $ 214.7 $ 6.9 $  $ 207.8 Marketable securities and investments consist of available-for-sale investments in U.S.treasury and agency securities and publicly traded equity securities for which market prices are readily available. Unrealized gains or losses on marketable securities and investments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) / income.
The fair value measurement of the contingent consideration obligations is primarily determined using Level3 inputs. The fair value of contingent consideration obligations is based on a probability-weighted income approach. The measurement is based upon unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity based on our own cash flow assumptions. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, including accretion expenses, are recorded in our consolidated statement of operations.For the year ended December31, 2014, income of $3.9 million, $0.4 million and $67.9 million has been included in cost of sales, general and administrative and R&D, respectively, including the write-offs of contingent consideration. For the year ended December31, 2013, charges of $7.2 million, $1.4 million, $1.1 million have been included in cost of sales, general and administrative, and R&D respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
The table below provides a summary of the changes in fair value, including net transfers in and/or out, of all financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level3) for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 (in millions): Balance at December31, 2013 Nettransfers in to (out of) Level 3 Purchasesand settlements,net Netaccretionand fair value adjustments Foreign currency translation Balance at December31, 2014 Liabilities: Contingent consideration obligations $ 207.8 $  $ 281.1 $ (89.0 ) $ (3.1 ) $ 396.8 Balance at December 31, 2012 Net transfers in to (out of) Level 3 Purchases and settlements, net Net accretion and fair value adjustments Foreign currency translation Balance at December 31, 2013 Liabilities: Contingent consideration obligations $ 363.1 $ (342.7 ) $ 176.9 $ 9.7 $ 0.8 $ 207.8 During the year ended December31, 2014, the Company recorded additional contingent consideration of $50.3 million in connection with the acquisition of metronidazole 1.3% vaginal gel antibiotic from Valeant, $17.1 million plus milestones in connection with the May 2014 Acquisition, $68.0 million in connection with the Forest Acquisition, $88.0 million in connection with the Furiex Acquisition, and $49.0 million in connection with the Durata Acquisition.
F-86 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) During the second quarter of 2014, the Company recorded fair value adjustments of contingent consideration of $22.8 million related specifically to IPR&D related to a project named Estelle and $1.5 million related to IPR&D for Colvir. Estelle is a novel natural estrogen-based 28 day cycle oral contraceptive for the prevention of pregnancy. At June30, 2014, the acquired IPR&D intangible asset of $13.1 million was deemed to be fully impaired. Consequently the $22.8 million contingent liability was written off; resulting in a net gain of $9.7 million in the year ended December31, 2014. Colvir is a treatment of premalignant Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) lesions of the uterine cervix. At June30, 2014, the acquired IPR&D intangible asset of $2.0 million was deemed to be fully impaired. Consequently the $1.5 million contingent liability was written off; resulting in a net loss of $0.5 million in the year ended December31, 2014.
During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company sold its rights in Aeroquin. As a result, the Company wrote-off $16.0 million in contingent consideration in the year ended December31, 2014. In addition, the Company wrote-off IPR&D of $18.0 million, resulting in a net loss of $2.0 million.
In the quarter ended December31, 2014, the Company evaluated future projections under the Metrogel Acquisition of the acquired product. As a result of this review, the Company noted the intangible asset was not fully recoverable. As such, the Company impaired the asset by $25.0 million. At the same time, the Company reversed contingent consideration (through cost of sales) of $21.0 million, for a net loss of $4.0 million.
As of December31, 2014 and 2013, the Company has contingent consideration obligations arising out of the following acquisitions (in millions): December31,2014 December31,2013 Medicines 360 Acquisition $ 126.6 $ 146.1 Furiex Acquisition 88.4  Forest Acquisition 52.4  Durata Acquisition 49.0  Metrogel Acquisition 31.2  May 2014 Acquisition 19.1  Uteron Acquisition 10.4 45.0 Other 19.7 23.6 Total $ 396.8 $ 214.7 During the year ended December31, 2013, the Company transferred to level 1 the contingent obligation for the Actavis Group earn-out ($335.8 million) and the Specifar acquisition ($6.9 million). The Company recorded additional contingent consideration of $43.4 million and $146.1 million in connection with the Uteron Acquisition and the license agreement entered into with Medicines360, respectively, offset in part by contingent payments made to the Arrow Group selling shareholders based on the after-tax gross profits sales of atorvastatin.
NOTE24 Commitments and Contingencies Legal Matters The Company and its affiliates are involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquires, investigations and proceedings, and litigation matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The process of resolving matters through litigation or other means is inherently uncertain and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of these matters will adversely affect the Company, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The Companys general practice is to expense legal fees as services are rendered in connection with legal matters, and to accrue for liabilities when losses are probable and reasonably estimable.
F-87 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that is accrued. As of December31, 2014, the Companys consolidated balance sheet includes accrued loss contingencies of approximately $365.0 million.
The Companys legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to mass tort actions and class actions with thousands of putative class members. These legal proceedings, as well as other matters, involve various aspects of our business and a variety of claims (including, but not limited to, qui tam actions, antitrust, product liability, breach of contract, securities, patent infringement and trade practices), some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. In addition, a number of the matters pending against us are at very early stages of the legal process (which in complex proceedings of the sort faced by us often extend for several years). As a result, some matters have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate a range of possible loss. In those proceedings in which plaintiffs do request publicly quantified amounts of relief, the Company does not believe that the quantified amounts are meaningful because they are merely stated jurisdictional limits, exaggerated and/or unsupported by the evidence or applicable burdens of proof.
Antitrust Litigation Actos  Litigation.
On December31, 2013 two putative class actions were filed in the federal district court ( United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1776& Participating Employers Health and Welfare Fund v. Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltc. Et al., S.D.N.Y. Civ. No.13-9244 and Crosby Tugs LLC v. Takeda Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd., et al.
, S.D.N.Y. Civ. No.13-9250) against Actavis plc and certain of its affiliates alleging that Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s (Watson now known as Actavis, Inc.) 2010 patent lawsuit settlement with Takeda Pharmaceutical, Co. Ltd. related to Actos  (pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin Actos  ) is unlawful. Several additional complaints have been filed ( Fraternal Order of Police, Fort Lauderdale Lodge 31, Insurance Trust Fund v. Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., et al.

, Civ. No.14-2846). The Company anticipates additional claims or lawsuits based on the same or similar allegations may be filed. Prior to the filing of the Painters District Council and City of Providence complaints, plaintiffs in the cases pending in federal court in New York filed a consolidated class action complaint. Plaintiffs in the Painters District Council and City of Providence cases subsequently voluntarily dismissed their complaints in Illinois and Rhode Island, respectively, and refiled their complaints in the Southern District of New York where all the cases have been referred to the same judge. Plaintiffs then filed a consolidated, amended complaint on May20, 2014 ( In re Actos End-Payor Antitrust Litigation , Civ. No.13-9244). The amended complaint, asserted on behalf of a putative class of indirect purchaser plaintiffs, generally alleges an overall scheme that included Watson improperly delaying the launch of its generic version of Actos  in exchange for substantial payments from Takeda in violation of federal and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. The complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief and unspecified damages. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on July11, 2014. Rather than oppose the motions to dismiss, plaintiffs amended their complaint on August22, 2014. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on October10, 2014. Plaintiffs oppositions to the motion were filed on F-88 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) December5, 2014 and defendants reply briefs were filed on January9, 2015. Oral argument on the motion is scheduled for March10, 2015.
The Company believes that it has substantial meritorious defenses to the claims alleged. However, these actions, if successful, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
AndroGel  Litigation.
On January29, 2009, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the State of California filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (Federal Trade Commission, et. al. v. Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et. al., USDC Case No.CV 09-00598) alleging that the September2006 patent lawsuit settlement between Watson and Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Solvay), related to AndroGel  1% (testosterone gel) CIII is unlawful. The complaint generally alleged that Watson improperly delayed its launch of a generic version of Androgel  in exchange for Solvays agreement to permit Watson to co-promote Androgel  for consideration in excess of the fair value of the services provided by Watson, in violation of federal and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. The complaint sought equitable relief and civil penalties. On February2 and 3, 2009, three separate lawsuits alleging similar claims were filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California by various private plaintiffs purporting to represent certain classes of similarly situated claimants (Meijer, Inc., et. al., v. Unimed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et. al., USDC Case No.EDCV 09-0215); (Rochester Drug Co-Operative, Inc. v. Unimed Pharmaceuticals Inc., et. al., Case No.EDCV 09-0226); (Louisiana Wholesale Drug Co. Inc. v. Unimed Pharmaceuticals Inc., et. al, Case No.EDCV 09-0228). On April8, 2009, the Court transferred the government and private cases to the UnitedStates District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. On April21, 2009 the State of California voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit against Watson without prejudice. The Federal Trade Commission and the private plaintiffs in the Northern District of Georgia filed amended complaints on May28, 2009. The private plaintiffs amended their complaints to include allegations concerning conduct before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, conduct in connection with the listing of Solvays patent in the FDA Orange Book, and sham litigation. Additional actions alleging similar claims have been filed in various courts by other private plaintiffs purporting to represent certain classes of similarly situated direct or indirect purchasers of Androgel  ( Stephen L. LaFrance Pharm., Inc. d/b/a SAJ Dist. v. Unimed Pharms., Inc., et al., D. NJ Civ. No.09-1507); ( Fraternal Order of Police, Fort Lauderdale Lodge 31, Insurance Trust Fund v. Unimed Pharms. Inc., et al., D.NJ Civ. No.09-1856); ( Scurto v. Unimed Pharms., Inc., et al., D. NJ Civ. No.09-1900); ( United Food and Commercial Workers Unions and Employers Midwest Health Benefits Fund v. Unimed Pharms., Inc., et al., D.MN Civ. No.09-1168); ( Rite Aid Corp. et al. v. Unimed Pharms., Inc. et al., M.D. PA Civ. No.09-1153 ); (Walgreen Co., et al. v. Unimed Pharms., LLC, et al., MD. PA Civ. No.09-1240); ( Supervalu, Inc. v. Unimed Pharms., LLC, et al, ND. GA Civ. No.10-1024); ( LeGrand v. Unimed Pharms., Inc., et al ., ND. GA Civ.
No.10-2883); ( Jabos Pharmacy Inc. v. Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al ., Cocke County, TN Circuit Court Case No.31,837). On April20, 2009, Watson was dismissed without prejudice from the Stephen L. LaFrance action pending in the District of NewJersey. On October5, 2009, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred all actions then pending outside of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia to that district for consolidated pre-trial proceedings ( In re: AndroGel  Antitrust Litigation (No.II), MDL Docket No.2084), and all currently-pending related actions are presently before that court. On February22, 2010, the judge presiding over all the consolidated litigations related to Androgel  then pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia granted Watsons motions to dismiss the complaints, except the portion of the private plaintiffs complaints that include allegations concerning sham litigation. Final judgment in favor of the defendants was entered in the Federal Trade Commissions action on April21, 2010. On April25, 2012, the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal. On June17, 2013, the Supreme Court issued a decision, holding that the settlements between brand and generic drug companies which include a payment from the brand company to the generic competitor must be evaluated under a rule of reason standard of review and ordered the case remanded (the Supreme Court Androgel Decision). On July20, 2010, the plaintiff in the Fraternal Order of Police action filed an amended complaint adding allegations concerning conduct before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, conduct in connection with the listing of Solvays patent in the FDAs Orange Book, and sham litigation similar to the claims raised in the direct purchaser actions. On F-89 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) October28, 2010, the judge presiding over MDL 2084 entered an order pursuant to which the LeGrand action, filed on September10, 2010, was consolidated for pretrial purposes with the other indirect purchaser class action as part of MDL 2084 and made subject to the Courts February22, 2010 order on the motion to dismiss. In February 2012, the direct and indirect purchaser plaintiffs and the defendants filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and on June22, 2012, the indirect purchaser plaintiffs, including Fraternal Order of Police, LeGrand and HealthNet, filed a motion for leave to amend and consolidate their complaints. On September28, 2012, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all outstanding claims. The plaintiffs then appealed. On September12 and 13, 2013, respectively, the indirect purchaser plaintiffs and direct purchaser plaintiffs filed motions with the district court, asking the court for an indicative ruling that it would vacate its final order on the parties summary judgment motions and conduct further proceedings in light of the Supreme Court Androgel Decision, should the Court of Appeals remand the case to the district court. On October23, 2013, the district court granted the motions. The court of appeals remanded the case back to the district court which has granted plaintiffs relief under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, vacating the ruling from which plaintiffs appealed. On August5, 2014 the indirect purchaser plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The Company answered the amended complaint on September15, 2014.
The Company believes it has substantial meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously. However, these actions, if successful, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Cipro  Litigation .Beginning in July2000, a number of suits were filed against Watson and certain Company affiliates including The Rugby Group, Inc. (Rugby) in various state and federal courts alleging claims under various federal and state competition and consumer protection laws. Several plaintiffs have filed amended complaints and motions seeking class certification. Approximately 42 cases were filed against Watson, Rugby and other Company entities. Many of these actions have been dismissed. Actions remain pending in various state courts, including California, Kansas, Tennessee, and Florida. The actions generally allege that the defendants engaged in unlawful, anticompetitive conduct in connection with alleged agreements, entered into prior to Watsons acquisition of Rugby from Sanofi Aventis (Sanofi), related to the development, manufacture and sale of the drug substance ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, the generic version of Bayers brand drug, Cipro  . The actions generally seek declaratory judgment, damages, injunctive relief, restitution and other relief on behalf of certain purported classes of individuals and other entities. The action pending in Kansas, which the court previously terminated administratively, has been reopened. Plaintiffs in that case moved for class certification on February21, 2014; defendants filed opposition to the class certification motion on May23, 2014. Class discovery ended on July25, 2014 and plaintiffs filed reply briefs in support of certification on August22, 2014. A hearing was held on October28, 2014 on defendants motion for an evidentiary hearing on class discovery and a hearing on the certification was held on December15, 2014. There has been no action in the cases pending in Florida and Tennessee since 2003. In the action pending in the California Superior Court for the County of San Diego ( In re: Cipro Cases I & II, JCCP Proceeding Nos. 4154& 4220 ), on July21, 2004, the California Court of Appeal ruled that the majority of the plaintiffs would be permitted to pursue their claims as a class. On August31, 2009, the California Superior Court granted defendants motion for summary judgment, and final judgment was entered on September24, 2009. On October31, 2011, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the Superior Courts judgment. On December13, 2011, the plaintiffs filed a petition for review in the California Supreme Court. On February15, 2012, the California Supreme Court granted review. On September12, 2012, the California Supreme Court entered a stay of all proceedings in the case pending a decision from the United States Supreme Court in the Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis matter involving Androgel, described above. The California Supreme Court lifted the stay on June26, 2013 following the ruling by the United States Supreme Court. Plaintiffs and Bayer announced that they have reached an agreement to settle the claims pending against Bayer and Bayer has now been dismissed from the action. Plaintiffs are continuing to pursue claims against the generic defendants, including Watson and Rugby. The remaining parties submitted letter briefs to the court regarding the impact of the Supreme Court Androgel Decision. Response briefs were submitted on February14, 2014. Amicus briefs were submitted on March18, 2014 and the parties filed responses to such briefs on April24, 2014.
F-90 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) In addition to the pending actions, the Company understands that various state and federal agencies are investigating the allegations made in these actions. Sanofi has agreed to defend and indemnify Watson and its affiliates in connection with the claims and investigations arising from the conduct and agreements allegedly undertaken by Rugby and its affiliates prior to Watsons acquisition of Rugby, and is currently controlling the defense of these actions.
Doryx Litigation .In July2012, Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Mylan) filed a complaint against Warner Chilcott and Mayne Pharma International Pty. Ltd. (Mayne) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania alleging that Warner Chilcott and Mayne prevented or delayed Mylans generic competition to Warner Chilcotts Doryx  products in violation of U.S. federal antitrust laws and tortiously interfered with Mylans prospective economic relationships under Pennsylvania state law. ( Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Warner Chilcott Public Limited Co., et al ., E.D.Pa. No.12-cv-03824). In the complaint, Mylan seeks unspecified treble and punitive damages and attorneys fees.
Following the filing of Mylans complaint, three putative class actions were filed against Warner Chilcott and Mayne by purported direct purchasers, and one putative class action was filed against Warner Chilcott and Mayne by purported indirect purchasers, each in the same court. On December5, 2013 an additional complaint was filed by the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 132 Health and Welfare Fund and on May9, 2014, Laborers Trust Fund for Northern California filed a complaint each on behalf of additional groups of purported indirect purchasers. Warner has moved to dismiss each of these new complaints. In each case the plaintiffs allege that they paid higher prices for Warner Chilcotts Doryx  products as a result of Warner Chilcotts and Maynes alleged actions preventing or delaying generic competition in violation of U.S. federal antitrust laws and/or state laws. Plaintiffs seek unspecified injunctive relief, treble damages and/or attorneys fees. The court consolidated the purported class actions and the action filed by Mylan and ordered that all the pending cases proceed on the same schedule.
On February5, 2013, four retailers, including HEB Grocery, Safeway, Inc., Supervalu, Inc. and Walgreen Co., filed in the same court a civil antitrust complaint in their individual capacities against Warner Chilcott and Mayne regarding Doryx  . ( Walgreen Co., Safeway, Inc., Supervalu, Inc. and HEB Grocery Co, LP. v. Warner Chilcott Public Limited Co., et al ., E.D.Pa. No.13-cv-00658). On March28, 2013, another retailer, Rite Aid, filed a similar complaint in the same court. ( Rite Aid Corp. v. Warner Chilcott Public Limited Co., et al ., E.D.Pa. No.13-cv-01644). Both retailer complaints recite similar facts and assert similar legal claims for relief to those asserted in the related cases described above. Both retailer complaints have been consolidated with the cases described above.
Warner Chilcott and Mayne moved to dismiss the claims of Mylan, the direct purchasers, the indirect purchasers and the retailers. On November21, 2012, the Federal Trade Commission filed with the court an amicus curiae brief supporting the plaintiffs theory of relief. On June12, 2013, the court entered a denial, without prejudice, of Warner Chilcott and Maynes motions to dismiss. On November13, 2013, Warner Chilcott and Mayne reached an agreement in principle to settle the claims of the Direct Purchaser Plaintiff class representatives for $15.0 million. On February18, 2014 the court preliminarily approved the settlement and after a hearing issued a final approval of the settlement on September15, 2014. On April18, 2014, Warner Chilcott and Mayne reached an agreement to settle the claims of the opt-out direct purchasers for $10.9 million. On May29, 2014 Warner Chilcott and Mayne reached an agreement in principle to settle the claims of the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiff class representatives for $8.0 million. On July11, 2014, the indirect purchaser plaintiffs filed a motion to approve the settlement with the court and on September9, 2014 the court, after a hearing, issued an order preliminarily approving this settlement. After a final fairness hearing, the indirect purchaser settlement received final approval on January28, 2015. Warner Chilcott and Mylan filed motions for summary judgment on March10, 2014. On June2, 2014, the court vacated the trial date. A new trial date has not been set.
The Company intends to vigorously defend its rights in the litigations. However, it is impossible to predict with certainty the outcome of any litigation, and the Company can offer no assurance as to when the lawsuits will be decided, whether the Company will be successful in its defense and whether any additional similar suits will F-91 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) be filed. The plaintiffs collectively seek approximately $1.2 billion in compensatory damages, which includes approximately $1.12 billion in purported damages of the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs, opt-out direct purchaser plaintiffs and Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs with whom the company has settled. The Company believes the damage amounts are unfounded and without merit. However, any award of compensatory damages could be subject to trebling. If the remaining claims are successful such claims could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.
Lidoderm  Litigation .On November8, 2013, a putative class action was filed in the federal district court ( Drogueria Betances, Inc. v. Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al ., E.D.Pa. Civ. No.13-06542) against Actavis, Inc. and certain of its affiliates alleging that Watsons 2012 patent lawsuit settlement with Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. related to Lidoderm  (lidocaine transdermal patches, Lidoderm  ) is unlawful. The complaint, asserted on behalf of putative classes of direct purchaser plaintiffs, generally alleges that Watson improperly delayed launching generic versions of Lidoderm  in exchange for substantial payments from Endo Pharmaceuticals in violation of federal and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. The complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief and damages. Additional lawsuits contain similar allegations have followed on behalf of putative classes of direct purchasers ( Rochester Drug Cooperative, Inc. v. Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al ., E.D.Pa.

Loestrin  24 Litigation.
On April5, 2013, two putative class actions were filed in the federal district court ( New York Hotel Trades Council& Hotel Assoc. of New York City, Inc. Health Benefits Fund v. Warner Chilcott Pub. Ltd. Co.
, et al ., D.N.J., Civ. No.13-02178, and United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1776 & Participating Employers Health and Welfare Fund v. Warner Chilcott (US), LLC, et al.
, E.D.Pa., No.13-01807) against Actavis, Inc. and certain affiliates alleging that Watsons 2009 patent lawsuit settlement with Warner Chilcott related to Loestrin  24 Fe (norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets, Loestrin  24) is unlawful. The complaints, both asserted on behalf of putative classes of end-payors, generally allege that Watson and another generic manufacturer improperly delayed launching generic versions of Loestrin  24 in exchange for substantial payments from Warner Chilcott, which at the time was an unrelated company, in violation of federal and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. The complaints each seek declaratory and injunctive relief and damages. On April15, 2013, the plaintiff in New York Hotel Trades withdrew its complaint and, on April16, 2013, refiled it in the federal court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania ( New York Hotel Trades Council& Hotel Assoc. of New York City, Inc. Health Benefits Fund v. Warner Chilcott Public Ltd. Co., et al ., E.D.Pa., Civ. No.13-02000). Additional complaints have been filed by different plaintiffs seeking to represent the same putative class of end-payors ( A.F. of L.  A.G.C. Building Trades Welfare Plan v.

Civ. No.13-307). In addition to the end-payor suits, two lawsuits have been filed on behalf of a class of direct payors ( American Sales Company, LLC v. Warner Chilcott Public Ltd., Co. et al ., D.R.I. Civ. No.12-347 and Rochester Drug Co-Operative Inc., v. Warner Chilcott (US), LLC, et al ., E.D.Pa. Civ. No.13-133476). On June18, 2013, defendants filed a motion with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) to consolidate these cases in one federal district court. After a hearing on September26, 2013, the JPML issued an order conditionally transferring all related Loestrin  24 cases to the federal court for the District of Rhode Island. ( In re Loestrin 24 Fe Antitrust Litigation , D.R.I. MDL No.13-2472). A preliminary hearing was held on November4, 2013 after which an amended, consolidated complaint was filed on December6, 2013. On February6, 2014, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the direct and indirect purchaser plaintiffs complaints. Plaintiffs filed oppositions to the motion on March24, 2014 and the Company filed its responses on April23, 2014. A hearing was held on June27, 2014 on the motion to dismiss and on September4, 2014, the court granted the motion. On October6, 2014, the direct purchaser plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the district courts opinion and on October20, 2014, they filed a motion for entry of a final judgment. Also, on October20, 2014 the indirect purchaser plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the courts September4, 2014 opinion. On November21, 2014 the Company moved to stay the opt-out direct purchasers action. The Company anticipates additional claims or lawsuits based on the same or similar allegations.
The Company believes it has substantial meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously including in the appeal of the district courts decision granting the Companys motion to dismiss. However, these actions, if successful, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Namenda Litigation .On September15, 2014, the State of New York, through the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ( The People of the State of New York v. Actavis, PLC, et al.
, Civ. No.14-7473) alleging that Forest is acting to prevent or delay generic competition to Forests immediate-release product Namenda in violation of federal and New York antitrust laws and committed other fraudulent acts in connection with its commercial plans for Namenda XR. Previously, the Attorney Generals office had issued a subpoena for records relating to Namenda XR and Namenda to which Forest was responding. In the complaint, the state seeks unspecified F-93 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) monetary damages and injunctive relief. On September24, 2014, the state filed a motion for a preliminary injunction prohibiting Forest from discontinuing or otherwise limiting the availability of immediate-release Namenda until the conclusion of the litigation. Forest filed an opposition to the Attorney Generals motion on October21, 2014. On November5, 2014, Forest announced its plans to discontinue the general sale and distribution of Namenda tablets in January 2015. Forest further announced that, after that date, Forest will make Namenda tablets available for prescribing to patients upon an indication of medical need as determined by their physician, and that the product will be made available through Foundation Care, a full service specialty mail-order pharmacy serving patients nationwide. On November5, 2014, the state filed a first amended complaint, alleging that Forests actions announced on November5, 2014 violated additional federal antitrust laws. On November7, 2014, Forest filed a motion to dismiss the states first amended complaint. A hearing was held from November10, 2014 through November17, 2014 on the Attorney Generals preliminary injunction motion. At a November24, 2014 hearing, the district court heard the parties closing arguments for the preliminary injunction hearing and oral argument on Forests motion to dismiss the states first amended complaint. On December11, 2014, the court issued a ruling granting the Attorney Generals injunction motion and issued an injunction on December15, 2014. Forest filed a notice of appeal of the courts decision and filed a motion with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals for an emergency stay of the district courts injunction and an expedited review on the appeal. On January6, 2015, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals denied Forests stay motion and granted Forests motion for expedited review of the appeal. Forest filed its appeal brief on January8, 2015 and New York filed its opposition brief on February 13, 2015. Forests reply brief is due by February23. The Court has ordered that oral argument be scheduled as soon as practicable thereafter.
The Company believes it has substantial meritorious defenses and intends to defend both its brand and generic defendant entities vigorously. However, these actions, if successful, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Opana Litigation .On December19, 2014, a putative class action was filed in California state court ( Mahaffay v. Impax Laboratories, Inc., et al.
, CA Super. Ct. Case No. HG14752254) against Actavis, Inc. and Actavis South Atlantic LLC alleging, among other things, that Actavis 2009 patent lawsuit settlement with Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. related to Opana ER  (extended release oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets) is unlawful. The complaint, asserted on behalf of a putative class of end payer plaintiffs, generally alleges that Actavis and Impax improperly delayed launching generic versions of Opana ER  in exchange for substantial consideration from Endo in violation of CA state antitrust, unfair competition and consumer protection laws. The complaint seeks damages and other equitable relief. The Company anticipates additional claims or lawsuits based on the same or similar allegations may be filed. The Company believes it has substantial meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously. However, this action and any others like it, if successful, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

F-95 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) We intend to continue to vigorously defend against these actions.At this time, we do not believe losses, if any, would have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position taken as a whole.
Forest and certain of its affiliates are also named as defendants in two actions filed on behalf of entities or individuals who purchased or reimbursed certain purchases of Celexa  and Lexapro  for pediatric use pending in the Missouri Circuit Court, Twenty-Second Judicial Circuit, and arising from similar allegations as those contained in the federal actions described in the preceding paragraphs.The first action, filed on November6, 2009 under the caption St. Louis Labor Healthcare Network et al. v. Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Forest Laboratories, Inc.
, is brought by two entities that purchased or reimbursed certain purchases of Celexa  and/or Lexapro  .The complaint asserts claims under the Missouri consumer protection statute and Missouri common law, and seeks unspecified damages and attorneys fees.We have reached an agreement with the plaintiffs to resolve this action for payments that are not material to our financial condition or results of operations.The second action, filed on July22, 2009 under the caption Crawford v. Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
, and now known as Luster v. Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
, is a putative class action on behalf of a class of Missouri citizens who purchased Celexa  for pediatric use.The complaint asserts claims under the Missouri consumer protection statute and Missouri common law, and seeks unspecified damages and attorneys fees.In October 2010, the court certified a class of Missouri domiciliary citizens who purchased Celexa  for pediatric use at any time prior to the date of the class certification order, but who do not have a claim for personal injury.On December9, 2013, we filed a motion for summary judgment, which was argued on January8, 2014.OnFebruary21, 2014, we filed a motion to de-certify the class.Decisions on these motions are pending.On March12, 2014, we informed the judge of the MDL Missouri class settlement described above, including that the federal class encompasses the members of the certified Missouri class in Luster .At a status conference on April2, 2014 the parties agreed that the action is stayed in light of the injunction contained in the MDL Preliminary Approval Order, described above.On January21, 2015, the company reached an agreement to settle with the Luster plaintiffs for a payment that is not material to our financial condition or results of operations We intend to continue to vigorously defend against this action.At this time, we do not believe losses, if any, would have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position taken as a whole.
Columbia Laboratories, Inc. Securities Litigation .On June8, 2012, Watson and certain of its officers were named as defendants in a consolidated amended class action complaint filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey ( In re: Columbia Laboratories , Inc. Securities Litigation , Case No.CV12-614) by a putative class of Columbia Laboratories stock purchasers. The amended complaint generally alleges that between December6, 2010 and January20, 2012, Watson and certain of its officers, as well as Columbia Laboratories and certain of its officers, made false and misleading statements regarding the likelihood of Columbia Laboratories obtaining FDA approval of Prochieve  progesterone gel, Columbia Laboratories developmental drug for prevention of preterm birth. Watson licensed the rights to Prochieve  from Columbia Laboratories in July 2010. The amended complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to disclose material information concerning the statistical analysis of the clinical studies performed by Columbia Laboratories in connection with its pursuit of FDAapproval of Prochieve  . The complaint seeks unspecified damages. On August14, 2012, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss all of the claims in the amended complaint, which the court granted on June11, 2013. Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on July11, 2013. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the second amended complaint on August9, 2013. On October21, 2013, the court granted the motion to dismiss the second amended complaint.

On December20, 2013, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on the district courts motion to dismiss ruling and filed their opening appellate brief on March20, 2014. Respondents briefs in the appeal were filed on April9, 2014. The oral argument on the appeal was held on December9, 2014. The Company believes it has substantial meritorious defenses and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additionally, the Company maintains insurance to provide coverage for the claims alleged in the action. However, litigation is inherently uncertain and the Company cannot predict the outcome of this litigation. The action, if successful, or if insurance does not provide sufficient coverage against such claims, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
F-96 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Forest Laboratories Securities Litigation.
In February and March 2014, nine putative stockholder class actions were brought against Forest, Forests directors, Actavis plc, and certain of Actaviss affiliates.Four actions were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery and have been consolidated under the caption In re Forest Laboratories, Inc. Stockholders Litigation (the Delaware Action).Five actions were filed in New York State Supreme Court and have been consolidated under the caption Turberg v. Forest Laboratories, Inc. et al.
(the New York Action).On April4 and May5, 2014, respectively, the Delaware and New York plaintiffs filed consolidated amended complaints in their respective jurisdictions.The amended complaints seek, among other remedies, to enjoin Actaviss proposed acquisition of Forest or damages in the event the transaction closes.The complaints generally allege, among other things, that the members of the Forest Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties by agreeing to sell Forest for inadequate consideration and pursuant to an inadequate process, and that the disclosure document fails to disclose allegedly material information about the transaction.The complaints also allege that Actavis, and certain of its affiliates, aided and abetted these alleged breaches.On May28, 2014, the defendants reached an agreement in principle with plaintiffs in the Delaware Action and the New York Action regarding a settlement of both Actions, and that agreement is reflected in a memorandum of understanding pursuant to which Forest agreed to make certain additional disclosures related to the proposed transaction with Actavis, which are contained in a Form 8-K filed May28, 2014.The parties entered into a definitive stipulation of settlement on February6, 2015 that remains subject to customary conditions, including court approval.A fairness hearing has not yet been scheduled. If the settlement is finally approved by the court, it will resolve and release all claims in all actions that were or could have been brought challenging any aspect of the proposed transaction, the merger agreement, and any disclosure made in connection therewith, including in the Definitive Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.There can be no assurance that the Delaware Court of Chancery will approve the settlementIn such event, the proposed settlement may be terminated.At this time, we do not believe losses, if any, would have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position taken as a whole.
Furiex Securities Litigation .In May 2014, four putative stockholder class actions were brought against Forest, Furiex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Furiex), and Furiexs board of directors.Two actions were brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery under the captions Steven Kollman v. Furiex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. et al.
and Donald Powell v. Furiex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. et al.
(the Delaware Actions).Two actions were brought in North Carolina state court under the captions Walter Nakatsukasa v. Furiex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. et al.
and Christopher Shinneman v. Furiex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. et al.
(the North Carolina Actions). These actions alleged, among other things, that the members of the Furiex Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties by agreeing to sell Furiex for inadequate consideration and pursuant to an inadequate process.These actions also alleged that Forest aided and abetted these alleged breaches.These actions sought class certification, to enjoin the proposed acquisition of Furiex, and an award of unspecified damages, attorneys fees, experts fees, and other costs. The Kollman and Nakatsukasa actions also sought recission of the acquisition and unspecified recissory damages if the acquisition was completed. On June23, 2014, the defendants reached an agreement in principle with plaintiffs in the Delaware Actions and the North Carolina Actions regarding a settlement of all four actions, and that agreement is reflected in a memorandum of understanding. In connection with the settlement contemplated by the memorandum of understanding, Furiex agreed to make certain additional disclosures related to the proposed transaction with us, which are contained in a Form DEFA14A filed June23, 2014.OnJanuary15, 2015, the parties entered into a stipulation of settlement which is subject to court approval.A fairness hearing has not yet been scheduled.If the settlement is finally approved by the court, it will resolve and release all claims in all four actions that were or could have been brought challenging any aspect of the proposed transaction and any disclosure made in connection therewith.There can be no assurance that the North Carolina state court will approve the settlement.In such event, the proposed settlement may be terminated. At this time, we do not believe losses, if any, would have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position taken as a whole.
Telephone Consumer Protection Act Litigation  Medical West Ballas Pharmacy, LTD, et al. v. Anda, Inc., (Circuit Court of the County of St. Louis, State of Missouri, Case No.08SL-CC00257). In January2008, Medical West Ballas Pharmacy, LTD, filed a putative class action complaint against Anda, Inc. (Anda), a subsidiary of F-97 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) the Company, alleging conversion and alleged violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and Missouri Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act. In April2008, plaintiff filed an amended complaint substituting Anda as the defendant. The amended complaint alleges that by sending unsolicited facsimile advertisements, Anda misappropriated the class members paper, toner, ink and employee time when they received the alleged unsolicited faxes, and that the alleged unsolicited facsimile advertisements were sent to the plaintiff in violation of the TCPA and Missouri Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act. The TCPA allows recovery of minimum statutory damages of $500 per violation, which can be trebled if the violations are found to be willful. The complaint seeks to assert class action claims on behalf of the plaintiff and other similarly situated third parties. In April2008, Anda filed an answer to the amended complaint, denying the allegations. In November2009, the court granted plaintiffs motion to expand the proposed class of plaintiffs from individuals for which Anda lacked evidence of express permission or an established business relationship to All persons who on or after four years prior to the filing of this action, were sent telephone facsimile messages advertising pharmaceutical drugs and products by or on behalf of Defendant. In November2010, the plaintiff filed a second amended complaint further expanding the definition and scope of the proposed class of plaintiffs. On December2, 2010, Anda filed a motion to dismiss claims the plaintiff is seeking to assert on behalf of putative class members who expressly consented or agreed to receive faxes from Defendant, or in the alternative, to stay the court proceedings pending resolution of Andas petition to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) (discussed below). On April11, 2011, the court denied the motion. On May19, 2011, the plaintiffs filed their motion seeking certification of a class of entities with Missouri telephone numbers who were sent Anda faxes for the period January 2004 through January 2008. The motion has been briefed. However, the court granted Andas motion to vacate the class certification hearing until similar issues are resolved in either or both the pending Nack litigation or with the FCC Petition, both of which are described in more detail below. No trial date has been set in the matter.
On May1, 2012, an additional action under the TCPA was filed by Physicians Healthsource, Inc., purportedly on behalf of the end users of the fax numbers in the United States but outside Missouri to which faxes advertising pharmaceutical products for sale by Anda were sent. ( Physicians Healthsource Inc. v. Anda Inc . S.D. Fla., Civ. No.12-60798). On July10, 2012, Anda filed its answer and affirmative defenses. The parties filed a joint motion to stay the action pending the resolution of the FCC Petition and the FCCs recently filed Public Notice, described below, which the court granted, staying the action for sixty days. On April17, 2014 following the expiration of the sixty day period, the court lifted the stay but reentered it sua sponte on May23, 2014.
Several issues raised in plaintiffs motion for class certification in the Medical West matter were addressed by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in an unrelated case to which Anda is not a party, Nack v. Walburg , No.11-1460.
Nack concerned whether there is a private right of action for failing to include any opt-out notice on faxes sent with express permission, contrary to a FCC regulation that requires such notice on fax advertisements. The Eighth Circuit granted Anda leave to file an amicus brief and to participate during oral argument in the matter, which was held on September19, 2012. In its ruling, issued May21, 2013, the Eighth Circuit held that Walburgs arguments on appeal amounted to challenges to the FCCs regulation and that the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain such challenges pursuant to the Hobbs Act and it would otherwise not decide any similar challenges without the benefit of full participation by the FCC. The defendant in Nack has filed a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court.
In October 2012, Forest and certain of its affiliates were named as defendants, along with The Peer Group, Inc. (TPG), in a putative class action brought by the St. Louis Heart Center (SLHC) under the caption St.Louis Heart Center, Inc. v. Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and The Peer Group, Inc.
The action is now pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.On May17, 2013, SLHC filed a Fourth Amended Complaint, alleging that Forest and TPG violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, as amended by the TCPA, on behalf of a proposed class that includes all persons who, from four years prior to the filing of the action, were sent telephone facsimile messages of material advertising the commercial availability of any property, goods, or services by or on behalf of defendants, which did not display an opt-out notice compliant F-98 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) with a certain regulation promulgated by the FCC.The Fourth Amended Complaint seeks $500 for each alleged violation of the TCPA, treble damages if the Court finds the violations to be willful, knowing or intentional, interest, and injunctive and other relief.On July17, 2013, the district court granted Forests motion to stay the action pending the administrative proceeding initiated by the pending FCC Petitions, including any appeal therefrom.
In a related matter, on November30, 2010, Anda filed a petition with the FCC, asking the FCC to clarify the statutory basis for its regulation requiring opt-out language on faxes sent with express permission of the recipient (the FCC Petition). On May2, 2012, the Consumer& Governmental Affairs Bureau of the FCC dismissed the FCC Petition. On May14, 2012, Anda filed an application for review of the Bureaus dismissal by the full Commission, requesting the FCC to vacate the dismissal and grant the relief sought in the FCC Petition. The FCC has not ruled on the application for review. On June27, 2013, Forest filed a Petition for Declaratory Ruling with the FCC requesting that the FCC find that (1)the faxes at issue in the action complied, or substantially complied with the FCC regulation, and thus did not violate it, or (2)the FCC regulation was not properly promulgated under the TCPA. On January31, 2014, the FCC issued a Public Notice seeking comment on several other recently-filed petitions, all similar to the one Anda filed in 2010. Anda and Forest were among several parties that submitted comments on the Public Notice. On October30, 2014, the FCC issued a final order granting the FCC Petition granting Anda, Forest and several other petitioners a retroactive waiver of the opt-out notice requirement for all faxes sent with express consent. The litigation plaintiffs, who had filed comments on the January 2014 Public Notice, have appealed the final order to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Anda, Forest and other petitioners have moved to intervene in the appeal seeking review of that portion of the FCC final order addressing the statutory basis for the opt out/express consent portion of the regulation.
Anda and Forest believe they have substantial meritorious defenses to the putative class actions brought under the TCPA, and intend to defend the actions vigorously. However, these actions, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Mezzion Declaratory Judgment Action .On April8, 2014, Warner Chilcott Company, LLC filed a declaratory judgment action against Mezzion Pharma Co. Ltd. (Mezzion), a Korean pharmaceutical company formerly known as Dong-A PharmaTech Co. Ltd.( Warner Chilcott Company, LLC v. Mezzion Pharma Co. Ltd ., N.Y. Sup. Ct., Case No.14-651094).The suit was filed to protect Warner Chilcott Company, LLCs rights and interests under an exclusive license and distribution agreement, involving Mezzions product udenafil that is used to treat erectile dysfunction and benign prostate hyperplasia.The parties first executed the agreement in 2008 and later amended it 2010.On February14, 2014, Mezzion sent a notice a breach letter to Warner Chilcott Company, LLC alleging that Warner Chilcott had failed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the product for the U.S. and Canadian markets.In its notice letter, Mezzion threatened to terminate the exclusive license and distribution agreement as a result of Warner Chilcotts purported breaches.Warner Chilcott believes that it has not breached the agreement and will prevail in the declaratory judgment action.On June2, 2014, Mezzion filed an answer and asserted counterclaims against the Company. The Company filed its answer to the counterclaims on July14, 2014. On January22, 2015, the Company and Mezzion reached an agreement to settle the litigation.
West Virginia Prescription Drug Abuse Litigation .On June26, 2012, the State of West Virginia filed a lawsuit against multiple distributors of prescription drugs, including Anda, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company ( State of West Virginia v. Amerisourcebergen Drug Corporation, et. al ., Boone County Circuit Court Civil Case No.12-C-141). The complaint generally alleges that the defendants distributed prescription drugs in West Virginia in violation of state statutes, regulation and common law. The complaint seeks injunctive relief and unspecified damages and penalties. On July26, 2012, a co-defendant removed the case to the federal court for the Southern District of West Virginia. On March27, 2013, the court granted plaintiffs motion to remand the case to state court. On January3, 2014, plaintiff filed an amended complaint which the defendants moved to dismiss on February14, 2014. Oral argument on the motion to dismiss was held on June5, 2014. On December16, 2014, the court issued its order denying the defendants motion to dismiss. The case is in its F-99 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) preliminary stages and the Company believes it has substantial meritorious defenses to the claims alleged. However, an adverse determination in the case could have an adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Prescription Drug Abuse Litigation .On May21, 2014, California counties Santa Clara and Orange filed a lawsuit on behalf of the State of California against several pharmaceutical manufacturers. Plaintiffs named Actavis plc in the suit. ( The People of the State of California v. Purdue Pharam L.P., et al , CA Super. Ct., Civil Case No.30-2014-00725287)(California Action). The California plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on June9, 2014. On July11, 2014, co-defendant Teva Pharmaceuticals removed the case to the federal court for the Central District of California (Civ. No.14-1080). The California plaintiffs moved to remand the case to state court on August11, 2014. Defendants filed an opposition to the remand motion on September19, 2014. On June2, 2014, the City of Chicago also filed a complaint against the same set of defendants, including Actavis plc, that were sued in the California Action. Co-defendants Janssen Pharmaceuticals and Endo Pharmaceuticals removed the City of Chicagos complaint to the federal court for the Northern District of Illinois (Civ.
No.14-4361).
On June16, 2014, the City of Chicago moved to have the case remanded to state court but later withdrew its remand motion. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint on August29, 2014. On October20, 2014, the City of Chicago filed an amended complaint against all defendants. Certain Actavis defendants filed motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The California motion was filed on December12, 2014 and the Chicago motion was filed on December19, 2014. Both the California and Chicago complaints allege that the manufacturer defendants engaged in a deceptive campaign to promote their products in violation of state and local laws. Each of the complaints seeks unspecified monetary damages, penalties and injunctive relief. The Company anticipates that additional suits will be filed. The Company believes it has several meritorious defenses to the claims alleged. However, an adverse determination in these actions could have an adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Testosterone Replacement Therapy Class Action .On November24, 2014, the Company was served with a putative class action complaint filed on behalf a class of third party payers in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that the Company and other named pharmaceutical defendants violated various laws including the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and state consumer protection laws in connection with the sale and marketing of certain testosterone replacement therapy pharmaceutical products (TRT Products), including the Companys Androderm  product. ( Medical Mutual of Ohio v. Abbvie Inc., at el.
, Civ. No.14-8857). This matter was filed in the TRT Products Liability multi-district litigation (MDL), described in more detail below, notwithstanding that it is not a product liability matter. Plaintiff alleges that it reimbursed third parties for dispensing TRT Products to beneficiaries of its insurance policies. Plaintiff seeks to obtain certain equitable relief, including injunctive relief and an order requiring restitution and/or disgorgement, and to recover damages and multiple damages in an unspecified amount. The Company has not yet responded to the Complaint and intends to vigorously defend the action. The parties have reached agreement on a briefing schedule for motions on the pleadings whereby briefing would be complete by July7, 2015. The Company believes it has substantial meritorious defenses to the claims alleged. However, an adverse determination in the case could have an adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Employment Litigation In July 2012, Forest and certain of its affiliates were named as defendants in an action brought by Megan Barrett, Lindsey Houser, Jennifer Jones, and Jennifer Seard, former Company Sales Representatives, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York under the caption Megan Barrett et al. v. Forest Laboratories Inc. and Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc .In November 2012, Plaintiffs amended the complaint, adding six additional plaintiffs: Kimberly Clinton, Erin Eckenrode, Julie Smyth, Marie Avila, Andrea Harley, and Christy Lowder, all of whom alleged that they were current or former Company Sales Representatives or Specialty Sales Representatives.In March 2013, Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint, adding one additional plaintiff: Tracy Le, a now-former Company Sales Representative.The action is a putative class and F-100 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) collective action, and the Second Amended Complaint alleges class claims under Title VII for gender discrimination with respect to pay and promotions, as well as discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, and a collective action claim under the Equal Pay Act.The proposed Title VII gender class includes all current and former female Sales Representatives (defined to include Territory Sales Representatives, Field Sales Representatives, Medical Sales Representatives, Professional Sales Representatives, Specialty Sales Representatives, Field Sales Trainers, and Regional Sales Trainers) employed by the Company throughout the U.S. from 2008 to the date of judgment, and the proposed Title VII pregnancy sub-class includes all current and former female Sales Representatives who have been, are, or will become pregnant while employed by the Company throughout the U.S. from 2008 to the date of judgment.The proposed Equal Pay Act collective action class includes current, former, and future female Sales Representatives who were not compensated equally to similarly-situated male employees during the applicable liability period.The Second Amended Complaint also includes non-class claims on behalf of certain of the named Plaintiffs for sexual harassment and retaliation under Title VII, and for violations of the Family and Medical Leave Act.We filed a motion to dismiss certain claims on April29, 2013, which was argued on January16, 2014.OnAugust14, 2014, the court issued a decision on the motion granting it in part and denying it in part, striking the plaintiffs proposed class definition and instead limiting the proposed class to a smaller set of potential class members and dismissing certain of the individual plaintiffs claims. Forest filed an answer to the complaint on October27, 2014. On January12, 2015, Plaintiffs filed a motion for equitable tolling; seeking tolling back to April29, 2013  the date of the Companys filing of the motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint.The Companys response to this motion is due on January26, 2015. Plaintiffs have until March6, 2015 to file a motion for conditional certification of the Equal Pay Act class. The litigation is still in its early stages and the parties are beginning to work on discovery matters. We intend to continue to vigorously defend against this action.At this time, we do not believe losses, if any, would have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position taken as a whole.
FDA Litigation In May2002, Company subsidiary Watson Laboratories, Inc. reached an agreement with the FDA on the terms of a consent decree with respect to its Corona, California manufacturing facility. The court approved the consent decree on May13, 2002 ( United States of America v. Watson Laboratories, Inc., et. al ., United States District Court for the Central District of California, EDCV-02-412-VAP). The consent decree applies only to the Companys Corona, California facility and not other manufacturing sites. The decree requires that the Corona, California facility complies with the FDAs current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regulations.
Pursuant to the agreement, the Company hired an independent expert to conduct inspections of the Corona facility at least once each year. In February 2014 the independent expert concluded its most recent inspection of the Corona facility. At the conclusion of the inspection, the independent expert reported its opinion to the FDA that, based on the findings of the audit of the facility, the FDAs applicable cGMP requirements, applicable FDA regulatory guidance, and the collective knowledge, education, qualifications and experience of the experts auditors and reviewers, the systems at the Corona facility audited and evaluated by the expert are in compliance with the FDAs cGMP regulations. However, the FDA is not required to accept or agree with the independent experts opinion. The FDA has conducted periodic inspections of the Corona facility since the entry of the consent decree, and concluded its most recent general cGMP inspection in April 2014. At the conclusion of the inspection, the FDA inspectors issued a Form483 to the facility identifying certain observations concerning the instances where the facility failed to follow cGMP regulations. The facility recently responded to the Form483 observations. If in the future, the FDA determines that, with respect to its Corona facility, the Company has failed to comply with the consent decree or FDA regulations, including cGMPs, or has failed to adequately address the FDAs inspectional observations, the consent decree allows the FDA to order a variety of actions to remedy the deficiencies. These actions could include ceasing manufacturing and related operations at the Corona facility, and recalling affected products. Such actions, if taken by the FDA, could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
F-101 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Patent Litigation Patent Enforcement Matters Actonel Once-a-Month .In August 2008,December 2008 and January 2009, Procter& Gambles global branded pharmaceutical business (PGP) and Hoffman-La Roche Inc. (Roche) received Paragraph IV certification notice letters from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries Teva), Sun Pharma Global, Inc. (Sun) and Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (together Apotex), respectively, indicating that each such company had submitted to the FDA an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) seeking approval to manufacture and sell generic versions of the Actonel  150 mg product (Actonel  OaM). The notice letters contended that Roches U.S. Patent No.7,192,938 (the 938 Patent), a method patent expiring in November 2023 (including a 6-month pediatric extension of regulatory exclusivity) which Roche licensed to PGP with respect to Actonel  OaM, was invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. PGP and Roche filed patent infringement suits against Teva in September 2008 ( Procter& Gamble Co. et al. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc ., Case No.08-cv-627), Sun in January 2009 ( Procter& Gamble Co. et al. v. Sun Pharma Global, Inc ., Case No.09-cv-061) and Apotex in March 2009 ( Procter& Gamble Co. et al. v. Apotex Inc. et al ., Case No.09-cv-143) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware charging each with infringement of the 938 Patent. The lawsuits resulted in a stay of FDA approval of each defendants ANDA for 30 months from the date of PGPs and Roches receipt of notice, subject to the prior resolution of the matters before the court. The stay of approval of each of Tevas, Suns and Apotexs ANDAs has expired, and the FDA has tentatively approved Tevas ANDA with respect to Actonel  OaM. However, none of the defendants challenged the validity of the underlying U.S. Patent No.5,583,122 (the 122 Patent), which covers all of the Actonel  products, including Actonel  OaM, and did not expire until June 2014 (including a 6-month pediatric extension of regulatory exclusivity). As a result, the defendants were not permitted to market their proposed generic versions of Actonel  OaM prior to June 2014.
On February24, 2010, Warner Chilcott and Roche received a Paragraph IV certification notice letter from Mylan indicating that it had submitted to the FDA an ANDA seeking approval to manufacture and sell a generic version of Actonel  OaM. The notice letter contends that the 938 Patent, which expires in November 2023 and covers Actonel  OaM, is invalid and/or will not be infringed. Warner Chilcott and Roche filed a patent suit against Mylan in April 2010 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware charging Mylan with infringement of the 938 Patent based on its proposed generic version of Actonel  OaM ( Procter& Gamble Co. et al. v. Mylan Pharms. Inc ., Case No.10-cv-285). The lawsuit resulted in a stay of FDA approval of Mylans ANDA for 30 months from the date of Warner Chilcotts and Roches receipt of notice, subject to prior resolution of the matter before the court. The stay of approval of Mylans ANDA has now expired. Mylan did not challenge the validity of the underlying 122 Patent, which expired in June 2014 (including a 6-month pediatric extension of regulatory exclusivity) and covers all of the Actonel  products.
In October, November and December 2010 and February 2011, Warner Chilcott and Roche received ParagraphIV certification notice letters from Sun, Apotex, Teva and Mylan, respectively, indicating that each such company had amended its existing ANDA covering generic versions of Actonel  OaM to include a Paragraph IV certification with respect to Roches U.S. Patent No.7,718,634 (the 634 Patent). The notice letters contended that the 634 Patent, a method patent expiring in November 2023 (including a 6-month pediatric extension of regulatory exclusivity) which Roche licensed to Warner Chilcott with respect to Actonel  OaM, was invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. Warner Chilcott and Roche filed patent infringement suits against Sun and Apotex in December 2010, against Teva in January 2011 and against Mylan in March 2011 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware charging each with infringement of the 634 Patent. No additional 30-month stay was available in these matters because the 634 Patent was listed in the FDAs Orange Book subsequent to the date on which Sun, Apotex, Teva and Mylan filed their respective ANDAs with respect to Actonel  OaM.
Warner Chilcott and Roches actions against Teva, Apotex, Sun and Mylan for infringement of the 938Patent and the 634 Patent arising from each such partys proposed generic version of Actonel  OaM were F-102 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) consolidated for all pretrial purposes (in Case No.08-cv-627), and a consolidated trial for those suits was previously expected to be held in July 2012. Following an adverse ruling in Roches separate ongoing patent infringement suit before the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey relating to its Boniva  product, in which the court held that claims of the 634 Patent covering a monthly dosing regimen using ibandronate were invalid as obvious, Teva, Apotex, Sun and Mylan filed a motion for summary judgment in Warner Chilcotts Actonel  OaM patent infringement litigation. In the motion, the defendants sought to invalidate the asserted claims of the 938Patent and 634 Patent, which cover a monthly dosing regimen using risedronate, on similar grounds. The previously scheduled trial has been postponed pending resolution of the new summary judgment motion. A hearing on Teva, Apotex, Sun and Mylans motions for summary judgment of invalidity and a separate motion by Warner Chilcott and Roche for summary judgment of infringement took place on December14, 2012. On March28, 2014, the district court granted the defendants motions for summary judgment that the 938 and 634 patents are invalid. Warner Chilcott and Roche intend to appeal the district courts decision, and on April25, 2014, Warner Chilcott and Roche filed a notice of appeal. On May21, 2014, Warner Chilcott and Roche filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent the launch of generic Actonel OaM. On June6, 2014, the court denied the motion for preliminary injunction. On June10, 2014, FDA approved generic versions of Actonel OaM. On June11, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied the Companys appeal of the District Courts preliminary injunction ruling. Warner Chilcott and Roche continue to appeal the District Courts summary judgment ruling. Certain generic manufacturers have launched their products notwithstanding this appeal. Oral argument occurred on October6, 2014. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Courts summary judgment of invalidity on November18, 2014.
To the extent that ANDA filers also submitted a Paragraph IV certification with respect to U.S. Patent No.6,165,513 covering Actonel  OaM, Warner Chilcott has not pursued an infringement action with respect to this patent. The Company also received a Notice Letter from Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. dated on or about June12, 2014. A complaint was filed on July28, 2014 before the United States District Court for the District of Delaware ( Warner Chilcott Company, LLC and Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. v. Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. and Aurobindo Pharma USA , Inc., C.A. No.14-cv-00990). The parties dismissed this suit with prejudice on January22, 2015.
Amrix  .In August 2014, Aptalis Pharmatech, Inc. (Aptalis) and Ivax International GmbH (Ivax), Aptaliss licensee for Amrix, brought an action for infringement of U.S. Patent No.7,790,199 (the 199 patent), and U.S. Patent No.7,829,121 (the 121 patent) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (collectively Apotex) (Case No.14-cv-1038). Apotex has notified Aptalis that it has filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking to obtain approval to market a generic version of Amrix before these patents expire. (The 199 and 121 patents expire in November 2023.) This lawsuit triggered an automatic stay of approval of Apotexs ANDA until no earlier than December27, 2016 (unless a court issues a decision adverse to Forest sooner, and subject to any other exclusivities, such as a first filer 180 day market exclusivity). On October6, 2014, the parties filed a joint stipulation in which Apotex agreed, among other things, to waive all defenses and counterclaims with the exception of its affirmative defenses and counterclaim of non-infringement. On October9, 2014, the district court issued a scheduling order setting a claim construction hearing in May 2015 and a trial date in November 2015. The Company believes it has meritorious claims to prevent the generic applicant from launching a generic version of Amrix. However, there can be no assurance a generic version will not be launched.
Asacol HD.
In September 2011, Warner Chilcott received a Paragraph IV certification notice letter from Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (together with its affiliates, Zydus) indicating that Zydus had submitted to the FDA an ANDA seeking approval to manufacture and sell a generic version of Warner Chilcotts Asacol  800mg product (ASACOL HD). Zydus contends that Warner Chilcotts U.S. Patent No.6,893,662, expiring in November 2021 (the 662 Patent), is invalid and/or not infringed. In addition, Zydus indicated that it had submitted a Paragraph III certification with respect to Medeva Pharma Suisse AGs (Medeva) U.S. Patent No.5,541,170 (the 170 Patent) and U.S. Patent No.5,541,171 (the 171 Patent), formulation and method patents which the Company exclusively licenses from Medeva covering Warner Chilcotts ASACOL products, F-103 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) consenting to the delay of FDA approval of the ANDA product until the 170 Patent and the 171 Patent expire in July 2013. In November 2011, Warner Chilcott filed a lawsuit against Zydus in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware charging Zydus with infringement of the 662 Patent ( Warner Chilcott Co., LLC v. Zydus Pharms. (USA) Inc. et al ., Case No. 1:2011cv01105). The lawsuit results in a stay of FDA approval of Zydus ANDA for 30 months from the date of Warner Chilcotts receipt of the Zydus notice letter, subject to prior resolution of the matter before the court. In January 2014 the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the case. Under the terms of the settlement, Zydus can launch its ANDA product in November 2015, or can launch an authorized generic version of Asacol HD in July 2016 if it fails to obtain FDA approval of its ANDA by such time. On June9, 2014, Warner Chilcott announced that the parties executed a definitive settlement agreement incorporating the terms set forth above.
Atelvia .In August and October 2011 and March 2012,Warner Chilcott received Paragraph IV certification notice letters from Watson Laboratories, Inc.  Florida (together with Actavis, Inc. (formerly Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and its subsidiaries, Actavis), Teva and Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (together with its affiliates, Ranbaxy) indicating that each had submitted to the FDA an ANDA seeking approval to manufacture and sell a generic version of Atelvia  35 mg tablets (Atelvia  ).The notice letters contend that Warner Chilcotts U.S. Patent Nos. 7,645,459 (the 459Patent) and 7,645,460 (the 460Patent), two formulation and method patents expiring in January 2028, are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. Warner Chilcott filed a lawsuit against Actavis in October 2011 ( Warner Chilcott Co., LLC et al. v. Watson Pharms., Inc. et al ., Case No.11-cv-5989), against Teva in November 2011 ( Warner Chilcott Co., LLC et al. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. et al ., Case No.11-cv-6936) and against Ranbaxy in April 2012 ( Warner Chilcott Co., LLC et al. v.Ranbaxy, Inc. et al ., Case No.12-cv-2474) in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey charging each with infringement of the 459 Patent and 460 Patent. On August21, 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued to the Company U.S. Patent No.8,246,989 (the 989 Patent), a formulation patent expiring in January 2026. The Company listed the 989 Patent in the FDAs Orange Book, each of Actavis, Teva and Ranbaxy amended its Paragraph IV certification notice letter to contend that the 989Patent is invalid and/or not infringed, and Warner Chilcott amended its complaints against Actavis, Teva and Ranbaxy to assert the 989 Patent. The lawsuits result in a stay of FDA approval of each defendants ANDA for 30 months from the date of Warner Chilcotts receipt of such defendants original notice letter, subject to prior resolution of the matter before the court. The Company does not believe that the amendment of its complaints against Actavis, Teva and Ranbaxy to assert the 989 Patent will result in any additional 30-month stay. In addition, none of the ANDA filers certified against the 122 Patent, which covers all of the Actonel  and Atelvia  products and expires in June 2014 (including a 6-month pediatric extension of regulatory exclusivity). On October2, 2013, Actavis divested its ANDA to Amneal Pharmaceuticals. In September 2013, Warner Chilcott received a Paragraph IV certification notice letter from Impax Laboratories, Inc. indicating that it had submitted to the FDA an ANDA seeking approval to manufacture and sell a generic version of Atelvia  . Warner Chilcott filed a lawsuit against Impax on October23, 2013, asserting infringement of the 459, 460, and 989 patents. The lawsuit results in a stay of FDA approval of Impaxs ANDA for 30 months from the date of Warner Chilcotts receipt of the notice letter, subject to prior resolution of the matter before the court. On June13,June30, and July15, 2014, the Company entered into settlement agreements with Ranbaxy, Amneal and Impax, respectively. Each agreement permits Ranbaxy, Amneal and Impax to launch generic versions of Atelvia  on July9, 2025, or earlier in certain circumstances. Trial against Teva began on July14, 2014 and concluded on July18, 2014. The Court has not issued its decision.
While the Company intends to vigorously defend the 459 Patent, the 460 Patent, and the 989 Patent and pursue its legal rights, the Company can offer no assurance as to when the lawsuit will be decided, whether such lawsuit will be successful or that a generic equivalent of Atelvia  will not be approved and enter the market prior to the July9, 2025 settlement dates above.
Canasa .In July 2013, Aptalis Pharma US, Inc. and Aptalis Pharma Canada Inc. brought actions for infringement of U.S. Patent No.8,217,083 (the 083 patent) and U.S. Patent No.8,436,051 (the 051 patent) in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Mylan ( Aptalis Pharma US, Inc., et al. v. Mylan F-104 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Pharmaceuticals Inc., et al.
, Case No.13-cv-4158) and Sandoz ( Aptalis Pharma US, Inc., et al. v. Sandoz, Inc.
, Case No.13-cv-4290). These companies have notified Aptalis that they have filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking to obtain approval to market generic versions of CANASA before these patents expire. Amended complaints were filed against these companies in November 2013 adding claims for infringement of U.S. Patent No.7,854,384 (the 384 patent). The 083, 051, and 384 patents expire in June 2028. Aptalis believes these ANDAs were filed before the patents covering Canasa were listed in the Orange Book, which generally means that Aptalis is not entitled to the 30-month stay of the approval of these ANDAs provided for by the Hatch-Waxman Act. The previously scheduled claim construction hearing set for August27, 2014 has been postponed to an undetermined date. No trial date has been set. The Company believes it has meritorious claims to prevent the generic applicants from launching a generic version of Canasa. However, there can be no assurance a generic version will not be launched.
Enablex  .On December18, 2013, Warner Chilcott Company LLC and Warner Chilcott (US) LLC sued Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and Torrent Pharma Inc. (together Torrent) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that sales of Torrents darifenacin tablets, a generic version of Warner Chilcotts Enablex  , would infringe U.S. Patent No.6,106,864 (the 864 patent) ( Warner Chilcott Company LLC et al. v. Torrent Pharms. Ltd, et al., Case No.13cv02039) . The complaint seeks injunctive relief. Pursuant to the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act, the FDA is precluded from granting final approval to Torrent until the earlier of thirty months after the generic applicant provided Warner Chilcott with notice of its ANDA filing or the generic applicant prevails in the pending litigation, subject to any other exclusivities, such as a first filer 180day market exclusivity.
On June6, 2014, Warner Chilcott Company LLC and Warner Chilcott (US) LLC sued Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC and Amneal Pharmaceuticals of New York, LLC (together Amneal) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that sales of Amneals darifenacin tablets, a generic version of Warner Chilcotts Enablex  , would infringe the 864 patent ( Warner Chilcott Company LLC et al. v. Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC, et al., Case No.14cv00718) . The complaint seeks injunctive relief. Pursuant to the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act, the FDA is precluded from granting final approval to Amneal until the earlier of thirty months after the generic applicant provided Warner Chilcott with notice of its ANDA filing or the generic applicant prevails in the pending litigation, subject to any other exclusivities, such as a first filer 180day market exclusivity. On July7, 2014, the Company settled with Torrent. The Company also settled with Amneal on September24, 2014. The Company has also received a Notice Letter dated June19, 2014 from Apotex Corp et al. and an analogous complaint was filed ( Warner Chilcott Company LLC et al. v. Apotex Corp ., et al., Case No.14cv00998).
Under the settlement agreements entered into in the third quarter of 2010 to resolve outstanding patent litigation, each of Teva, Anchen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Watson agreed not to launch a generic version of Enablex  until the earlier of March15, 2016 (or June15, 2016, if a 6-month pediatric extension of regulatory exclusivity is granted) or, among other circumstances, (i)the effective date of any license granted to a third party for a generic Enablex product or (ii)in the event a third party launches a generic Enablex  product at risk and injunctive relief is not sought or granted.
The Company believes it has meritorious claims to prevent Apotex from launching a generic version of Enablex. However, if Apotex prevails in the pending litigation or if Amneal or another ANDA filer launches a generic version of Enablex  before the pending or any subsequent litigation is finally resolved, it could have an adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Generess  Fe .On November22, 2011, Warner Chilcott Company sued Mylan Inc., Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Famy Care Ltd. in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that sales of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol and ferrous fumarate tablets, a generic version of Warner Chilcotts Generess  Fe tablets (which is exclusively licensed by Warner Chilcott), would infringe U.S. Patent No.6,667,050 (the 050 patent) ( Warner Chilcott Company LLC v.

Watson Labs., Inc. et al ., Case No.12-cv-2928) in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey charging each with infringement of the 394 Patent and the 984 Patent. Warner Chilcott granted Lupin and Actavis covenants not to sue on the 394 Patent with regard to their ANDAs seeking approval for a generic version of Lo Loestrin  Fe, and the court dismissed all claims concerning the 394Patent in the Lupin and the Actavis litigations in December 2012 and February 2013, respectively. The lawsuits result in a stay of FDA approval of each defendants ANDA for 30months from the date of Warner Chilcotts receipt of such defendants notice letter, subject to the prior resolution of the matter before the court. On October2, 2013, Actavis divested its ANDA to Amneal Pharmaceuticals. On October4, 2013, Amneal Pharmaceuticals was substituted for Actavis as a defendant. A joint trial began on October7, 2013 and concluded on October17, 2013. On January17, 2014, the district court issued its decision that the 984 Patent is valid and infringed by Lupins and Amneals respective ANDAs.

Mylan Inc. et al ., Case No.13-cv-06560) in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey charging Mylan and Famy Care with infringement of the 984 Patent. The complaint seeks injunctive relief. The lawsuit results in a stay of FDA approval of Mylan and Famy Cares ANDA for 30 months from the date of Warner Chilcotts receipt of the notice letter, subject to the prior resolution of the matter before the court. The Mylan/Famy Care case is not consolidated with the Lupin case and is currently pending in the district court.

Warner Chilcott further notes that FDA will not approve any ANDA product before May8, 2016 due to Minastrin  24 Fes new dosage form exclusivity, which expires on that date. The litigation against Lupin is pending. Warner Chilcott notes that on April29, 2014, several of the claims of the 050 patent were declared invalid in the Generess litigation discussed above. Warner Chilcott has appealed the Generess decision and the appeal is currently pending. The Company believes Warner Chilcott has meritorious claims on appeal. However, if Lupin prevails in the Generess appeal, or in the instant litigation, it could have an adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Namenda  .In June 2014, Forest Laboratories, Inc., Forest Laboratories Holdings, Ltd.

These lawsuits triggered an automatic stay of approval of the applicable ANDAs that expires no earlier than June 2016 (unless a court issues a decision adverse to Plaintiffs sooner). On June11, 2014, Mylan filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, which Plaintiffs opposed on June30, 2014. Mylans motion remains pending. On December18, 2014, Ranbaxy filed an Inter Partes Review before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, (No. 2015-00410), with respect to the 085 patent. On October17, 2014, Forest and Actavis Laboratories FL, Inc. (f/k/a Watson Laboratories, Inc.  Florida) filed a stipulation dismissing their respective claims without prejudice. On November3, 2014, Plaintiffs entered into a settlement agreement with Wockhardt. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, and subject to review of the settlement terms by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Plaintiffs will provide a license to Wockhardt that will permit it to launch its generic version of Namenda XR as of the date that is the later of (a)two (2)calendar months prior to the expiration date of the last to expire of the 703 patent, the 209 patent, the 708 patent, the 379 patent, the 752 patent, the 085 patent, and the 233 patent, including any extensions and/or pediatric exclusivities; or (b)the date that Wockhardt obtains final FDA approval of its ANDA, or earlier in certain circumstances. On January13, 2015, Plaintiffs entered into settlement agreements with Anchen and Par. Under the terms of the settlement agreements, and subject to review of the settlement terms by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Plaintiffs will provide licenses to Anchen and Par that will permit them to launch their generic versions of Namenda XR as of the date that is the later of (a)two (2)calendar months prior to the expiration date of the last to expire of the 209 patent, the 708 patent, the 379patent, the 752 patent, the 085 patent, and the 233 patent, as well as the 009 patent for Par only, including any extensions and/or pediatric exclusivities; or (b)the dates that Anchen and Par obtain final FDA approval of their respective ANDAs, or earlier in certain circumstances. On November20, 2014, the district court issued a scheduling order setting a claim construction hearing in May 2015 and a trial date in February 2016.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act, the FDA is precluded from granting final approval to the generic applicants prior to April8, 2016. The Company believes it has meritorious claims to prevent the generic applicants from launching a generic version of Rapaflo.

Patent Defense Matters Bayer Patent Litigation .In August2012, Bayer Pharma AG (together with its affiliates, Bayer) filed a complaint against Warner Chilcott in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that Warner Chilcotts manufacture, use, offer for sale, and/or sale of its Lo Loestrin  Fe oral contraceptive product infringes Bayers U.S.Patent No.5,980,940 ( Bayer Intellectual Property GMBH et al. v. Warner Chilcott Co., LLC et al ., Case No.12-cv-1032). In the complaint, Bayer seeks injunctive relief and unspecified monetary damages for the F-109 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) alleged infringement. In December 2012, Bayer amended the complaint to add a patent interference claim seeking to invalidate the Companys 984 Patent, which covers the Lo Loestrin  Fe product.

On December15, 2014, Warner Chilcott filed a Summary Judgment motion seeking dismissal of the case.
Although it is impossible to predict with certainty the outcome of any litigation, the Company believes that it has a number of strong defenses to the allegations in the complaints and intends to vigorously defend the litigations. These cases are in the early stages of litigation, and an estimate of the potential loss, or range of loss, if any, to the Company relating to these proceedings is not possible at this time.
Lamictal ODT.
On November19, 2014, Aptalis Pharmatech, Inc. and Aptalis Pharma Canada Inc. (Aptalis) were named as defendants in a declaratory judgment action brought by Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Par) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania ( Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. v. GlaxoSmithKline LLC, et al.
, Civil Action No.14-6627). In the complaint, Par alleges that it submitted an ANDA seeking approval to market its generic version of Lamictal ODT and that its ANDA received tentative approval from FDA on October30, 2014. Par alleges that U.S Patent No.7,919,115 (the 115 patent), which is listed in the Orange Book for Lamictal ODT and is assigned to Aptalis, will not be infringed by Pars generic product. Par alleges that the 115 patent remains a barrier to it receiving final FDA approval for its generic product because, prior to the submission of Pars ANDA, another applicant submitted an ANDA for a generic version of Lamictal ODT containing a Paragraph IV certification to the 115 patent. Par seeks a declaration that its generic product will not infringe the 115 patent. On January14, 2015, Impax Laboratories, Inc. filed a motion to intervene in the action, which it withdrew on January27, 2015. On January15, 2015, Aptalis, GlaxoSmithKline LLC and Par filed a consent judgment and dismissal order, which the district court entered on January30, 2015.
Oxymorphone Extended-Release Tablets (Generic version of Opana  ER) .On December11, 2012, EndoPharmaceuticals Inc. (Endo) sued Actavis and certain of its affiliates in the United States District Court for the Southern District of NewYork, alleging that sales of the Companys 7.5 mg and 15 mg oxymorphone extended-release tablets, generic versions of Endos Opana  ER, infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,851,482; 8,309,122; and 8,329,216, which the USPTO recently issued or Endo recently acquired ( Endo Pharms. Inc. v. Actavis Inc. et al ., Case No.12-cv-8985). On July11, 2013, the FDA approved Actavis 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, and 40 mg oxymorphone extended-release tablets. On August6, 2013, Endo filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to prevent Actavis from selling its 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, and 40 mg oxymorphone extended-release tablets. On September12, 2013, the Court denied Endos motion for a preliminary injunction and Actavis began selling its generic versions of Opana  ER. On September17, 2013, Endo filed a motion for an injunction pending appeal, which the Federal Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied on November21, 2013. On January9, 2014, the Federal Circuit heard oral arguments on Endos appeal of the district courts denial of the motion for a preliminary injunction. On March31, 2014, the Federal Circuit reversed the district courts denial of Endos motion for a preliminary injunction and remanded the matter to the district court for further consideration. Trial in this matter will begin in March 2015. On November7, 2014, Endo and Mallinckrodt LLC sued Actavis and certain of its affiliates in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that sales of the Companys generic versions of Opana  ER, 5mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg and 40mg, generic versions of Endos Opana  ER, infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,808,737 and 8,871,779, which Endo licensed from Mallinckrodt and the USPTO recently issued to or Endo, respectively ( Endo Pharms. Inc. et. al v. Actavis Inc. et al ., Case No.14-cv-01381). The Company believes it has substantial meritorious defenses to the case. However, Actavis has sold and is continuing to sell its generic versions of Opana  ER, 5mg, 7.5 mg, 10mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg and 40 mg. Therefore, an adverse final determination that one of the patents in suit is valid and infringed could have an adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Budesonide Inhalation Suspension (Generic version of Pulmicort Respules  ) .On March 19, 2008, AstraZeneca LP and AstraZeneca AB (Astra) sued Breath Limited in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that Breaths filing of an ANDA for Budesonide Inhalation Suspension 0.25 mg/ F-110 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 2 mL and 0.5 mg/2 mL, a generic version of Astras Pulmicort Respules product, infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 6,598,603 (the 603 patent); 6,899,099 (the 099 patent); and 7,524,834 (the 834 patent) ( AstraZeneca LP et al. v.

On November 1, 2010, in connection with a preliminary injunction against Apotex, the Federal Circuit affirmed a district court decision that the asserted claims of the 099 patent are invalid. On July 31, 2012, the FDA approved Breath/Watsons ANDA for Budesonide Inhalation Suspension 0.25 mg/2 mL and 0.5 mg/2 mL. On April 1, 2013, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey found the asserted claims of the 603 patent invalid and that Breath/Watsons ANDA did not infringe the asserted claims of the 834 patent. On April 3, 2013, the district court entered an injunction preventing the launch of any generic product to allow Astra to file an appeal with the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit continued that injunction pending the appeal. On October 30, 2013, the Federal Circuit affirmed the district courts finding that the asserted claims of the 603 patent are invalid, but reversed the district courts non-infringement finding with respect to the 834 patent and remanded the case back to the district court for reconsideration under a new claim construction for the term micronized powder composition. On January 17, 2014, Astra moved for a preliminary injunction. On June 4, 2014, the district court consolidated the preliminary injunction proceedings with the upcoming trial. The second trial concluded on October 29, 2014, and the court heard closing arguments on January 29, 2015.

That same day, Astra filed a motion for an injunction pending appeal. The court denied Astras motion for an injunction that same day. On February 13, 2015, Actavis commercially launched the Breath/Watson approved product. On February 16, 2015, Astra filed a notice of appeal and filed with the Federal Circuit an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal. On February17, 2015, the Federal Circuit ordered that (i)Actavis is to respond no later than February20, 2015 and any reply is due within 3 days of the Actavis response; and (ii)Actavis and the other generic defendants are temporarily enjoined from launching or distributing the accused generic products, pending the Federal Circuits review of the papers submitted. The Company believes it has substantial meritorious defenses to the case. However, Actavis has sold and is continuing to sell its generic versions of the 0.25 mg/2 mL and 0.5 mg/2 mL strengths of Pulmicort Respules. Therefore, an adverse final determination that 834 patent is valid and infringed could have an adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Teva Namenda XR Patent Litigation .In December 2013, Forest Laboratories, Inc. (Forest) was named as a defendant in an action brought by Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. and Mayne Pharma International Pty Ltd. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware ( Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., et al. v. Forest Laboratories, Inc.
, Case No.13-cv-2002). The complaint alleges that Forest infringes U.S. Patent No.6,194,000 by making, using, selling, offering to sell, and importing Namenda XR. The relief requested includes preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, and damages. On June11, 2014, Forest filed a motion for judgment of non-infringement on the pleadings, which remains pending. The district court has scheduled a claim construction hearing in June 2015, and trial to begin in July 2016. The Company intends to continue to vigorously defend against this action. At this time, we do not believe losses, if any, would have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position taken as a whole.
Product Liability Litigation Actonel  Litigation .Warner Chilcott is a defendant in approximately 204 cases and a potential defendant with respect to approximately 415 unfiled claims involving a total of approximately 627 plaintiffs and potential plaintiffs relating to Warner Chilcotts bisphosphonate prescription drug Actonel  . The claimants allege, among other things, that Actonel  caused them to suffer osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), a rare but serious condition that involves severe loss or destruction of the jawbone, and/or atypical fractures of the femur (AFF). All of the cases have been filed in either federal or state courts in the United States. Warner Chilcott is in the initial stages of discovery in these litigations. The 415 unfiled claims involve potential plaintiffs that have agreed, pursuant to a tolling agreement, to postpone the filing of their claims against Warner Chilcott in exchange for Warner Chilcotts agreement to suspend the statutes of limitations relating to their potential claims. In addition, Warner Chilcott is aware of fourpurported product liabilityclass actionsthat were brought against Warner Chilcott in provincial courts in Canada alleging, among other things, that Actonel  caused the plaintiffsand the proposed F-111 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) class members who ingested Actonel  to suffer atypical fractures or other side effects. It is expectedthat these plaintiffswill seekclass certification. Of the approximately 631 total Actonel  -related claims, approximately 75include ONJ-related claims, approximately 538 include AFF-related claims and approximately four include both ONJ and AFF-related claims. In some of the cases, manufacturers of other bisphosphonate products are also named as defendants. Plaintiffs have typically asked for unspecified monetary and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys fees. Warner Chilcott is reviewing these lawsuits and potential claims and intends to defend these claims vigorously.
Sanofi, which co-promoted Actonel  with Warner Chilcott in the United States through the end of 2013 pursuant to a collaboration agreement, is a defendant in some of Warner Chilcotts Actonel  product liability cases. Sanofi and Warner Chilcott continue to co-promote Actonel  in other countries pursuant to the collaboration agreement. Under the collaboration agreement, Sanofi has agreed to indemnify Warner Chilcott, subject to certain limitations, for 50% of the losses from any product liability claims in Canada relating to Actonel  and for 50% of the losses from any product liability claims in the United States and Puerto Rico relating to Actonel  brought prior to April1, 2010, which included approximately 90 claims relating to ONJ and other alleged injuries that were pending as of March31, 2010. Pursuant to the April 2010 amendment to the collaboration agreement, Warner Chilcott will be fully responsible for any product liability claims in the UnitedStates and Puerto Rico relating to Actonel  brought on or after April1, 2010. Warner Chilcott may be liable for product liability, warranty or similar claims in relation to products acquired from The Procter& Gamble Company (P&G) in October 2009 in connection with Warner Chilcotts acquisition (the PGP Acquisition) of P&Gs global branded pharmaceuticals business (PGP), including ONJ-related claims that were pending as of the closing of the PGP Acquisition. Warner Chilcotts agreement with P&G provides that P&G will indemnify Warner Chilcott, subject to certain limits, for 50% of Warner Chilcotts losses from any such claims, including approximately 88 claims relating to ONJ and other alleged injuries, pending as of October30, 2009.
In May 2013, Warner Chilcott entered into a settlement agreement in respect of up to 74 ONJ-related claims, subject to the acceptance thereof by the individual respective claimants. Warner Chilcott recorded a charge in the six months ended June30, 2013 in the amount of $2.0 million in accordance with ASC Topic 450 Contingencies in connection with Warner Chilcotts entry into the settlement agreement. This charge represents Warner Chilcotts current estimate of the aggregate amount that is probable to be paid by Warner Chilcott in connection with the settlement agreement. In September 2013, Warner Chilcott entered into a separate settlement agreement in respect of up to 53 additional ONJ-related claims, subject to the acceptance thereof by the individual respective claimants. Assuming that all of the relevant claimants accept the settlement agreements, approximately 587 Actonel  -related claims would remain outstanding, of which approximately 31 include ONJ-related claims, approximately 538 include AFF-related claims and approximately four include both ONJ and AFF-related claims. However, it is impossible to predict with certainty (i)the number of such individual claimants that will accept the settlement agreement or (ii)the outcome of any litigation with claimants rejecting the settlement or other plaintiffs and potential plaintiffs with ONJ, AFF or other Actonel  -related claims, and the Company can offer no assurance as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in any of these matters. An estimate of the potential loss, or range of loss, if any, to the Company relating to proceedings with (i)claimants rejecting the settlement or (ii)other plaintiffs and potential plaintiffs with ONJ, AFF or other Actonel  -related claims is not possible at this time. The Company believes it has substantial meritorious defenses to these cases and Warner Chilcott maintains product liability insurance against such cases. However, litigation is inherently uncertain and the Company cannot predict the outcome of this litigation. These actions, if successful, or if insurance does not provide sufficient coverage against such claims, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Alendronate Litigation .Beginning in 2010, a number of product liability suits were filed against the Company and certain of its affiliates, as well as other manufacturers and distributors of alendronate, for personal injuries including femur fractures and ONJ allegedly arising out of the use of alendronate. Approximately F-112 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 132cases are pending against Actavis and/or its affiliates in various state and federal courts, representing claims by approximately 176 plaintiffs. These cases are generally at their preliminary stages. Fifty-one lawsuits also name as a defendant Cobalt Laboratories, which Watson acquired in 2009 as part of its acquisition of the Arrow Group, in connection with Cobalts manufacture and sale of alendronate. Twenty cases naming the Company and/or its affiliates were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings as part of a multi-district litigation (MDL) matter pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey ( In re: Fosamax (Alendronate Sodium) Products Liability Litigation , MDL No.2243). In 2012, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey granted the Companys motion to dismiss all of the cases then pending against the Company in the New Jersey MDL. The Third Circuit affirmed. Any cases filed against the Company in the District of New Jersey MDL after the Courts January 2012 dismissal are subject to a case management order that calls for their dismissal unless plaintiffs can establish that their claims should be exempted from the 2012 dismissal order. To date, no plaintiff with a post-January 2012 complaint in the District of New Jersey against the Company has moved for such exemption and all such cases have been dismissed. Eleven other cases were part of an MDL in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, where the Company filed a similar motion to dismiss. The Court granted, in part, that motion to dismiss, which has resulted in the dismissal of eight cases. The Company has also been served with nine cases that are part of consolidated litigation in the California Superior Court (Orange County). In 2012, the Orange County Court partially granted a motion filed on behalf of all generic defendants seeking dismissal. The cases in California were stayed while appeals were taken. Those appeals were recently exhausted and, the Company has not yet been able to determine how that will affect the cases filed against and served on it. All cases pending in state courts in Kentucky and Missouri have been discontinued against the Company. The remaining 120 active cases are part of a mass tort coordinated proceeding in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Atlantic County. In that state court proceeding, the Court granted, in part, a motion to dismiss. As a result, the Company has obtained the stipulated dismissal of 299 cases. Due to a recent reorganization of the mass tort docket in the State of New Jersey, the coordinated alendronate proceedings have been transferred to Middlesex County. The Company has not yet determined what affect, if any, the transfer of venue will have on the New Jersey state court litigation. The Company believes that it has substantial meritorious defenses to these cases and maintains product liability insurance against such cases. However, litigation is inherently uncertain and the Company cannot predict the outcome of this litigation. These actions, if successful, or if our indemnification arrangements or insurance do not provide sufficient coverage against such claims, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Benicar  Litigation.
Approximately 62 actions involve allegations that Benicar  , a treatment for hypertension that Forest co-promoted with Daiichi Sankyo between 2002 and 2008, caused certain gastrointestinal injuries.Under Forests Co-Promotion Agreement, Daiichi Sankyo is defending us in these lawsuits.
Celexa  /Lexapro  Litigation .Forest and its affiliates are defendants in 12 actions involving allegations that Celexa  or Lexapro  caused or contributed to individuals committing or attempting suicide, or caused a violent event.The MDL that was established for the federal suicidality-related litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri has concluded and the remaining cases have been remanded to the federal district courts in which they were filed originally.The Company was granted summary judgment in two cases, one of which is being appealed. The other case may be appealed. At present, six trials are scheduled in 2015 with the possibility that additional cases could be set for trial in 2015 or 2016.
Approximately 195 of the actions against Forest and its affiliates involve allegations that Celexa  or Lexapro  caused various birth defects.Several of the cases involve multiple minor-plaintiffs. The majority of these actions have been consolidated in Cole County Circuit Court in Missouri.One action is set for trial in Cole County in November 2015.Another action is pending in Orange County, California and is set for trial in June 2015. Multiple actions also were filed in New Jersey and at present there are 10 actions pending in Hudson County, New Jersey. None of the New Jersey cases are set for trial. There are birth defect cases pending in other jurisdictions but none currently are set for trial.
F-113 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The Company believes it has substantial meritorious defenses to the Celexa  /Lexapro  cases and maintains product liability insurance against such cases. However, litigation is inherently uncertain and the Company cannot predict the outcome of this litigation. These actions, if successful, or if insurance does not provide sufficient coverage against such claims, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Fentanyl Transdermal System Litigation .Beginning in 2009, a number of product liability suits were filed against Actavis and other Company affiliates, as well as other manufacturers and distributors of fentanyl transdermal system products, for personal injuries or deaths allegedly arising out of the use of the fentanyl transdermal system products. Actavis settled the majority of these cases in November 2012. Since that time, additional cases have been resolved individually and/or are in the process of being resolved. There are approximately threecases that remain pending against the Company in state and federal courts that have not been resolved. Discovery is ongoing. The Company believes it has substantial meritorious defenses to these cases and maintains product liability insurance against such cases. However, litigation is inherently uncertain and the Company cannot predict the outcome of this litigation. These actions, if successful, or if insurance does not provide sufficient coverage against such claims, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Metoclopramide Litigation.
Beginning in 2009, a number of product liability suits were filed against certain Company affiliates, including legacy Actavis and Watson companies, as well as other manufacturers and distributors of metoclopramide, for personal injuries allegedly arising out of the use of metoclopramide. Approximately 1,500cases remain pending against Actavis, Watson and/or its affiliates in state and federal courts, representing claims by multiple plaintiffs. Discovery in these cases is in the preliminary stages as the Company is actively moving to dismiss the suits and either initiating or defending appeals on such motions. The Company believes that, with respect to the majority of the cases against the legacy Watson companies, it will be defended in and indemnified by Pliva, Inc., an affiliate of Teva, from whom the Company purchased its metoclopramide product line in late 2008. With respect to the cases pending against the legacy Actavis companies, the Company is actively defending them. The Company believes that it has substantial meritorious defenses to these cases and maintains product liability insurance against such cases. However, litigation is inherently uncertain and the Company cannot predict the outcome of this litigation. These actions, if successful, or if our indemnification arrangements or insurance do not provide sufficient coverage against such claims, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Propoxyphene Litigation.
Beginning in 2011, a number of product liability suits were filed against Watson and certain of its affiliates, as well as other manufacturers and distributors of propoxyphene, for personal injuries including adverse cardiovascular events or deaths allegedly arising out of the use of propoxyphene. Cases are pending against Watson and/or its affiliates in various state and federal courts, representing claims by approximately 1,385 plaintiffs.Approximately 77 of the cases naming Watson were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings as part of a multi-district litigation (MDL) matter pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky ( In re: Darvocet, Darvon, and Propoxyphene Products Liability Litigation , MDL No.2226). Four of the MDL cases were voluntarily dismissed by plaintiffs with prejudice. On June22, 2012, the court hearing the MDL cases granted the generic defendants joint motion to dismiss the remaining MDL cases. Approximately 34 of the dismissed cases were appealed by the plaintiffs to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. On June27, 2014, the Sixth Circuit issued its opinion affirming the District Courts dismissal of the generic defendants in all respects. It is anticipated that the plaintiffs will seek further review by the United States Supreme Court. Plaintiffs had 90 days from the issuance of the Sixth Circuits decision within which to file a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court but they did not do so. In addition to the 77 consolidated cases, the MDL court remanded sevenadditional cases to California state court.Defendants jointly filed a petition with the Sixth Circuit to appeal that remand, which petition was denied, as was the subsequently filed petition for rehearing on the petition to appeal.The Sixth Circuits Order denying Defendants petition for rehearing was recently vacated due to the Ninth Circuits granting of a petition for en banc rehearing on the same issue. The Ninth Circuitcase involves remand by a federal court in California to state F-114 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) court in a propoxyphene case involving the same defendants.The Sixth Circuit has now stayed these 7 cases pending the ruling of the Ninth Circuit on the issue.The Ninth Circuit issued its en banc opinion on November18, 2014 reversing the district courts remand to California state court. Defendants notified the Sixth Circuit of the opinion issued by the Ninth Circuit, and on December1, 2014 filed a Motion to Lift Stay of the 7cases pending in the Sixth Circuit, requesting that the Sixth Circuit accept Defendants petition for permission to appeal and summarily reverse the district courts remand order.Approximately 35 of the cases naming Watson or its affiliates have been consolidated in a state court proceeding pending in the Superior Court of California in Los Angeles. After the consolidation, the defendants jointly removed all of the cases to various U.S. District Courts in California after which counsel for the plaintiffs moved to remand the cases back to state court. The various U.S. District Court Judges granted the motions. The defendants jointly appealed the remand of these cases to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the granting of the motions to remand. The defendants then jointly petitioned the Ninth Circuit for an en banc rehearing of the defendants appeal. The Ninth Circuit granted the defendants Petition and oral argument was heard on June26, 2014. On November18, 2014 the Ninth Circuit, en banc , issued its ruling reversing the remand of the California cases to state court. In light of the Ninth Circuits en banc opinion, the Company is awaiting further direction from the court regarding the California cases. The defendants in the California cases have served notice of the Ninth Circuits ruling on the Judge handling the cases in state court so that his court can return the cases to the various District Courts from which they were remanded. Once all the cases are returned to the District Courts, the defendants will attempt to have the cases transferred to the MDL, which may not be possible under the provisions of the Class Action Fairness Act, or request that the cases be assigned to a single District Court Judge in California. Once these procedural matters are resolved the Company will file demurrers and motions to dismiss. On November18, 2014 a new propoxyphene action naming Watson among the many defendants was filed in Oklahoma state court and it is believed that others may have been filed in that court as well, although Watson has not yet been served with the Complaints in the Oklahoma case(s). The Company believes that it has substantial meritorious defenses to these cases and maintains product liability insurance against such cases.However, litigation is inherently uncertain and the Company cannot predict the outcome of this litigation. These actions, if successful, or if insurance does not provide sufficient coverage against such claims, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Testosterone Litigation .Beginning in 2014, a number of product liability suits were filed against the Company and certain of its affiliates, as well as other manufacturers and distributors of testosterone products, for personal injuries including but not limited to cardiovascular events allegedly arising out of the use of Androderm  testosterone cypionate, AndroGel and/or testosterone enanthate. Actavis, Inc. and/or one or more of its subsidiaries have been served in sixty-four currently pending actions, all of which are pending in federal court. On June6, 2014 the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered all federal actions claiming injury from testosterone productsbe consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ( In re Testosterone Replacement Therapy Products Liability Litigation , MDL 2545).Accordingly, the aforementioned federal actions have been consolidated into MDL 2545. The Company anticipates that additional suits will be filed. These cases are in the initial stages and discovery is in the early stages. The Company believes that it has substantial meritorious defenses to these cases and maintains product liability insurance against such cases. However, litigation is inherently uncertain and the Company cannot predict the outcome of this litigation. These actions, if successful, or if insurance does not provide sufficient coverage against such claims, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Zarah Litigation.
A number of product liability suits, eight (8)in total, are pending against the Company and/or certain of its affiliates as well as other manufacturers and distributors of oral contraceptive products for personal injuries allegedly arising out of the use of the generic oral contraceptive, Zarah  .All of the actions are consolidated in the Yaz/Yasmin Multidistrict Litigation pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois.The injuries alleged include, but are not limited to, pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, and gallbladder disease.These cases are in the initial stages and discovery has not yet commenced.

Qui Tam and Related Litigation Governmental Investigation and False Claims Act Litigation.
Beginning in February 2012, Warner Chilcott, along with several of its current and former employees in its sales organization and certain third parties, received subpoenas from the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts. The subpoena received by Warner Chilcott seeks information and documentation relating to a wide range of matters, including sales and marketing activities, payments to people who are in a position to recommend drugs, medical education, consultancies, prior authorization processes, clinical trials, off-label use and employee training (including with respect to laws and regulations concerning off-label information and physician remuneration), in each case relating to all of Warner Chilcotts current key products. The Company is cooperating in responding to the subpoena. The Company has recorded a contingent liability for the year ended December31, 2014 under ACS450, Contingencies, based on its analysis of this matter, however, there can be no assurance that the Companys estimate will not differ materially from the recorded contingent liability.
The Company is aware of threequi tamcomplaints filed by former Warner Chilcott sales representatives and unsealed in February and March 2013 and March 2014 ( United States ex rel. Lisa A. Alexander and James P. Goan. v. Warner Chilcott PLC, et al.
, D. Mass. No.11-10545 and United States et al. ex rel. Chris Wible, v. Warner Chilcott PLC, et al.
, D. Mass. No.11-11143; People of the State of California ex rel. Schirrell Johnson, Lisa A. Alexander and James P. Goan v. Warner Chilcott PLC, et al.
, CA Super. Ct., Case No. BC496620-MHS). The unsealedfederal qui tamcomplaints allege that Warner Chilcott violated Federal and state false claims acts through the promotion of all of Warner Chilcotts current key products by, among other things, making improper claims concerning the products, providing kickbacks to physicians and engaging in improper conduct concerning prior authorizations. The complaints seek, among other things, treble damages, civil penalties of up to eleven thousand dollars for each alleged false claim and attorneys fees and costs. Other similar complaints may exist under seal. The United States of America has elected not to intervene at this time in the unsealed Alexander/Goan or Wible qui tam actions, stating at the times of the relevant seal expirations that its investigation of the allegations raised in the relevant complaint was continuing and, as such, it was not able to decide at such time whether to intervene in the action. The United States of America may later seek to intervene, and its election does not prevent the plaintiffs/relators from litigating the actions. The government has, however, successfully moved the court in the Alexander and Goan litigation to stay that proceeding through March1, 2015. The company has met with the government to discuss the status, and a potential resolution of, its investigation. On December2, 2013, plaintiff in the Wible action filed a notice of voluntary dismissal with respect to all of its claims except his for retaliation and claims under CA and IL state law. Warner Chilcott moved to dismiss the remaining cause of action in this Wible complaint on December20, 2013. While the Companys motion was pending, the plaintiff in Wible moved for leave to file a third amended complaint which the court granted thus rendering the Companys motion to dismiss moot. The Company and the plaintiff in Wible have reached an agreement to settle the matter. The State of California declined to intervene in the recently unsealed Johnson/Alexander/Goan qui tam action. Warner Chilcott removed the Johnson/Alexander/Goan case to the federal court for the Central District of California (Civ. No.14-3249). On May30, 2014, Warner Chilcott filed a motion to dismiss the Johnson/Alexander/Goan complaint. Rather than respond to the motion, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on August8, 2014. Warner Chilcotts response to the amended complaint was filed on September12, 2014. Plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motion on October17, 2014 and Warner Chilcotts reply brief was filed on October31, 2014. Oral argument on the motion will be held in January 2015. Warner Chilcott intends to vigorously defend itself in the litigations. However, these cases are in the early stages of litigation, it is impossible to predict with certainty the outcome of any litigation, and the Company can offer no assurance as to when the lawsuits will be decided, whether Warner Chilcott will be successful in its defense and whether any F-116 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) additional similar suits will be filed. If these claims are successful such claims could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.
Forest received a subpoena dated August5, 2013 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General.The subpoena requests documents relating to the marketing and promotion of Bystolic  , Savella  , and Namenda  , including with respect to speaker programs for these products.In February 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin unsealed a qui tam complaint with the caption United States of America ex rel. Kurt Kroening et al. v. Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Forest Laboratories, Inc.

Forests response to the complaint is due by April15, 2015. In January 2014, the Eastern District of Wisconsin U.S. Attorneys Office notified the court that it had not completed its investigation and therefore would not intervene in the action at that time (while reserving the right to intervene at a later date).We are continuing to cooperate with this investigation and to discuss these issues with the government.We intend to vigorously defend against the complaint.At this time, we do not believe losses, if any, would have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position taken as a whole.
In April 2014, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts unsealed a qui tam complaint with the caption United States of America ex rel. Timothy Leysock v.

Forest filed an answer to the remaining claims on December10, 2014. At this time, we do not believe losses, if any, would have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position taken as a whole.

Paroxetine Investigation .On April19, 2013, the UK Office of Fair Trading (which closed in April, 2014 in connection with a government restructuring and transferred responsibility for this matter to the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority) issued a Statement of Objections against GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and various generic drug companies, including Actavis UK Limited, formerly known as Alpharma Limited, now a subsidiary of the Company, alleging that GSKs settlements with such generic drug companies improperly delayed generic entry of paroxetine, in violation of the United Kingdoms competition laws. The Company has responded to the Statement of Objections, and believes it has substantial meritorious defenses to the allegations. However, an adverse determination in the matter could have an adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Governmental Reimbursement Investigations and Drug Pricing Litigation.
In November1999, Schein Pharmaceutical, Inc., now known as Actavis Pharma, Inc. was informed by the U.S. Department of Justice that it, along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, is a defendant in a qui tam action brought in 1995 under the U.S. False Claims Act currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the Florida Qui Tam Action). The Company has not been served in the qui tam action. A qui tam action is a civil lawsuit brought by an individual or a company (the qui tam relator) for an alleged violation of a federal statute, in which the U.S. Department of Justice has the right to intervene and take over the prosecution of the lawsuit at its option. Pursuant to applicable federal law, the qui tam action is under seal as to Actavis, Inc. The Company believes that the qui tam action relates to whether allegedly improper price reporting by pharmaceutical manufacturers led to increased payments by Medicare and/or Medicaid. The Company believes that the Florida Qui Tam Action against the Company was dismissed without prejudice while still sealed as to the Company. Subsequently, the Company also received and responded to notices or subpoenas from the Attorneys General of various states, including Florida, Nevada, New York, California and Texas, relating to pharmaceutical pricing issues and whether allegedly improper actions by pharmaceutical manufacturers led to excessive payments by Medicare and/or Medicaid. On June26, 2003, the Company received a request for records and information from the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce in connection with that committees investigation into pharmaceutical reimbursements and rebates under Medicaid. The Company produced documents in response to the request. Other state and federal inquiries regarding pricing and reimbursement issues are anticipated.

Abbott Laboratories, Inc., et al., Case No.596144, Parish of East Baton Rouge, 19 th Judicial District.
In 2011, Watson settled certain claims made against it by a relator in a qui tam action brought against the Company on behalf of the United States.The settlement of that qui tam action resolved all claims on behalf of the United States asserted in that action except for claims relating to the federal share of Medicaid payments made by the States of Alabama, Alaska, Kentucky, Idaho, Illinois, South Carolina and Wisconsin. The Company subsequently settled all claims, including the claims on behalf of the United States, brought by Alabama. In addition, the Company has reached settlements with the states of the Louisiana, Missouri, Kansas and South Carolina. The court in the Utah case recently dismissed that states claims against the Company. The case against Watson on behalf of Kentucky was tried in November 2011. The jury reached a verdict in Watsons favor on each of Kentuckys claims against Watson. An agreed form of judgment has been entered and the case now has been dismissed with prejudice. The case against Watson on behalf of Mississippi was tried from November 2012 through April 2013. On August28, 2013, the court issued a ruling in favor of the state and awarded the state $12.4 million in compensatory damages and civil penalties, and on March20, 2014 issued its ruling imposing an additional $17.9 million in punitive damages. Post-trial motions were filed and denied by the court. The Company is appealing both the original and punitive damage awards.
In addition, Forest and certain of its affiliates are defendants in three state court actions that allege that the plaintiffs (all governmental entities) were overcharged for their share of Medicaid drug reimbursement costs as a result of reporting by manufacturers of average wholesale prices (AWP) that did not correspond to actual provider costs of prescription drugs.These actions are pending in Illinois (commenced February7, 2005), Mississippi (commenced October20, 2005), Utah (commenced May 2008), and Wisconsin (a qui tam AWP action commenced by the former Attorney General of the State of Wisconsin on February20, 2012 that the State declined to join).Discovery is ongoing in these actions.On November15, 2013, the plaintiff in the Mississippi action moved for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint.On March26, 2014, the Mississippi state court granted plaintiffs motion in part, but denied plaintiffs request to add generic drug products to its claims.Forest has filed a motion to dismiss certain of the claims asserted in the Second Amended Complaint.On May21, 2014, the plaintiff in the Mississippi action filed a separate complaint asserting claims against Forest with respect to the pricing of its generic drugs, and Forest has filed a motion to dismiss certain of these claims. A trial in the Mississippi action is scheduled in August 2015.A motion to dismiss the Utah action was granted, but the Utah Supreme Court, while upholding the lower courts ruling regarding a statute of limitations issue, reversed that ruling and allowed the plaintiff to replead.The plaintiff filed another Amended Complaint, and the defendants filed a motion to dismiss.This motion to dismiss was denied in part, and discovery is proceeding.On February17, 2014, the Wisconsin state court granted defendants motion to dismiss plaintiffs Second Amended Complaint.On April14, 2014, plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a Third Amended Complaint, and on May16, 2014, plaintiff filed an appeal of the courts February17, 2014 ruling.On June12, 2014, the court denied plaintiffs motion to file a Third Amended Complaint and dismissed the case without prejudice. The plaintiff in the Wisconsin case has abandoned its appeal of the lower courts dismissal of its complaint. We intend to continue to vigorously defend against these actions.At this time, we do not believe losses, if any, would have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position taken as a whole.
With regard to the remaining drug pricing actions, the Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself in those actions. The Company continually monitors the status of these actions and may settle or otherwise resolve some or all of these matters on terms that the Company deems to be in its best interests. However, the Company can give no assurance that it will be able to settle the remaining actions on terms it deems reasonable, or that such settlements or adverse judgments in the remaining actions, if entered, will not exceed the amounts of the liability reserves. Additional actions by other states, cities and/or counties are anticipated. These actions and/or the actions described above, if successful, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
F-119 Table of Contents NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Medicaid Drug Reimbursement Litigation.
In December2009, the Company learned that numerous pharmaceutical companies, including certain subsidiaries of the Company, were named as defendants in a qui tam action pending in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts ( United States of America ex rel. Constance A. Conrad v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc. et. al., USDC Case No.02-CV-11738-NG) . The seventh amended complaint, which was served on certain of the Companys subsidiaries in December2009, alleges that the defendants falsely reported to the United States that certain pharmaceutical products were eligible for Medicaid reimbursement and thereby allegedly caused false claims for payment to be made through the Medicaid program. In July2011, the plaintiff served a tenth amended complaint that unseals the action in its entirety and continues to allege the previously asserted claims against certain subsidiaries of the Company. TheCompanys subsidiaries named in theaction together with all other named defendantsfiled a Joint Motion to Dismiss the Tenth Amended Complainton December9, 2011. On February25, 2013, the court granted the motion to dismiss as to all defendants. The plaintiff may appeal. On September11, 2013, a similar action was filed against certain Company subsidiaries as well as Warner Chilcott and numerous other pharmaceutical company defendants by the State of Louisiana based on the same core set of allegations as asserted in the Conrad qui tam action. The state filed the case in state court and defendants removed it to the federal district court (Civ. No.13-0681). On September9, 2014, the magistrate judge in the case issued a report recommending that the case be remanded to state court and the case is now proceeding in state court. Defendants responses to the plaintiffs complaint were submitted on October30, 2014. Additional actions alleging similar claims could be asserted. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims and intends to vigorously defend itself against such allegations. However, these actions or similar actions, if successful, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Medicaid Price Adjustments.
The Company has notified the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) that certain of the legacy Actavis groups Medicaid price submissions require adjustment for the period 2007 through 2012. The Company is in the process of completing the resubmissions. Based on prevailing CMS practices the Company does not expect to incur penalties in connection with the resubmissions. With respect to periods prior to 2007, the Company has advised CMS that its records are insufficient to support a reliable recalculation of its price submissions, and has proposed not to recalculate the price submissions for such periods. Because there are insufficient records to support a reliable recalculation of its price submissions prior to 2007, at this time the amount of any potential liability related to the price submissions prior to 2007 is not estimable and the Company has not concluded that any liability for periods prior to 2007 is probable. The Company believes it has substantial meritorious positions and defenses with respect to these pricing resubmission matters. However, if CMS were to successfully pursue claims against the Company for the periods in question, such claims could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
The Company and its affiliates are involved in various other disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquires, investigations and proceedings that could result in litigation, and other litigation matters that arise from time to time. The process of resolving matters through litigation or other means is inherently uncertain and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of these matters will adversely affect the Company, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The following table illustrates any customer, on a global basis, which accounted for 10% or more of our annual revenues in any of the past three fiscal years and the respective percentage of our revenues for which they account for each of the last three years: Customer 2014 2013 2012 AmerisourceBergen Corporation 28 % 8 % 7 % McKesson Corporation 21 % 11 % 14 % Cardinal Healthcare, Inc.
13 % 9 % 9 % Walgreens 1 % 9 % 16 % Changes in the mix of concentration amongst the Companys largest customers are due, in part, to the impact of acquisitions as well as changes in the supply chain of our indirect customers.
The Companys accounts receivable primarily arise from product sales in North America and Europe and primarily represent amounts due from wholesalers, distributors, drug store chains and service providers in the health care and pharmaceutical industries, public hospitals and other government entities. Approximately 67% and 45% of the gross accounts receivable balance are concentrated among the Companys three largest customers as of December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains an allowance for potential uncollectible accounts. Actual losses from uncollectible accounts have been minimal.
Outside of the U.S., concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets using the Companys products, as well as their dispersion across many different geographic areas.The Company monitors economic conditions, including volatility associated with international economies, and related impacts on the relevant financial markets and its business, especially in light of sovereign credit issues. The Company does not expect to have write-offs or adjustments to accounts receivable which would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
Certain of the Companys finished products and raw materials are obtained from single source suppliers. Although the Company seeks to identify more than one source for its various finished products and raw materials, loss of a single source supplier could have an adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Further, a second source supplier may not be able to produce the same volumes of inventory as the Companys primary supplier. No manufacturer accounted for 10% or more of the Companys products sold based on third-party revenues for the year ended December31, 2014.
