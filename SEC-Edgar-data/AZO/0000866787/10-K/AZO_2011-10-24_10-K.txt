3 PART       I Item       1. Business Introduction We       are       the nations leading specialty retailer and a leading distributor of automotive       replacement parts and accessories, with most of our sales to do-it-yourself       (DIY) customers. We began operations in 1979 and at August 25, 2007 operated       3,933 stores in the United States and Puerto Rico, and 123 in Mexico. Each       of       our stores carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles,       vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts,       maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products. In many of our       stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit       and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national       repair garages, dealers and service stations. We also sell the ALLDATA brand       automotive diagnostic and repair software. On the web at www.autozone.com,       we       sell diagnostic and repair information, auto and light truck parts, and       accessories. We do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation       services.
At       August       25, 2007, our stores were in the following locations: Alabama 90 Arizona 110 Arkansas 59 California 428 Colorado 55 Connecticut 31 Delaware 10 Florida 173 Georgia 160 Idaho 18 Illinois 192 Indiana 125 Iowa 22 Kansas 37 Kentucky 74 Louisiana 97 Maine 6 Maryland 38 Massachusetts 66 Michigan 133 Minnesota 22 Mississippi 81 Missouri 90 Montana 1 Nebraska 13 Nevada 42 New                 Hampshire 16 New                 Jersey 57 New                 Mexico 54 New                 York 112 North                 Carolina 145 North                 Dakota 2 Ohio 205 Oklahoma 66 Oregon 25 Pennsylvania 101 Puerto                 Rico 15 Rhode                 Island 15 South                 Carolina 68 South                 Dakota 1 Tennessee 145 Texas 492 Utah 34 Vermont 1 Virginia 81 Washington 44 Washington,                 DC 6 West                 Virginia 22 Wisconsin 48 Wyoming 5 Domestic                 Total 3,933 Mexico 123 TOTAL 4,056 4 Marketing       and Merchandising Strategy We       are       dedicated to providing customers with superior service, value and quality       automotive parts and products at conveniently located, well-designed stores.       Key       elements of this strategy are: Customer       Service Customer       service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising       strategy, which is based upon consumer marketing research. We emphasize that       our       AutoZoners (employees) should always put customers first by providing prompt,       courteous service and trustworthy advice. Our electronic parts catalog assists       in the selection of parts; and lifetime warranties are offered by us or our       vendors on many of the parts we sell. Our wide area network in our stores helps       us to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes, to locate       parts at neighboring AutoZone stores, and in some cases, to place special orders       directly with our vendors.
Our       stores generally open at 7:30 or 8 a.m. and close between 8 and 10 p.m. Monday       through Saturday and typically open at 9 a.m. and close between 6 and 9 p.m.       on       Sunday. However, some stores are open 24 hours, and some have extended hours       of       6 or 7 a.m. until midnight seven days a week.
We       also       provide specialty tools through our Loan-A-Tool program. Customers can borrow a       specialty tool, such as a steering wheel puller, for which a DIY customer or       a       repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job. AutoZoners       also provide other free services, including check engine light readings; battery       charging; oil recycling; and testing of starters, alternators, batteries,       sensors and actuators.
Merchandising The       following table shows some of the types of products that we sell: Hard                 Parts Maintenance                 Items Accessories                 and Non-Automotive A/C                 Compressors Antifreeze                 & Windshield Washer Fluid Air                 Fresheners Alternators Belts                 & Hoses Cell                 Phone Accessories Batteries                 & Accessories Brake                 Drums, Rotors, Chemicals,                 including Brake & Power Steering                 Fluid, Oil & Fuel Additives Drinks                 & Snacks Floor                 Mats Shoes                 & Pads Fuses Hand                 Cleaner Carburetors Lighting Neon                 Lighting Clutches Oil                 & Transmission Fluid Mirrors CV                 Axles Oil,                 Air, Fuel & Transmission Filters Paint                 & Accessories Engines Oxygen                 Sensors Performance                 Products Fuel                 Pumps Protectants                 & Cleaners Seat                 Covers Mufflers Refrigerant                 & Accessories Steering                 Wheel Covers Shock                 Absorbers & Struts Sealants                 & Adhesives Stereos Starters Spark                 Plugs & Wires Tools Water                 Pumps Wash                 & Wax Windshield                 Wipers 5 We       believe that the satisfaction of DIY customers and professional technicians       is       often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as       requested. Our stores generally offer approximately 21,000 stock keeping units       (SKUs), covering a broad range of vehicle types. Each store carries the same       basic product lines, but we tailor our parts inventory to the makes and models       of the vehicles in each stores trade area. Our hub stores carry a larger       assortment of products that can be delivered to commercial customers or local       satellite stores. In excess of 750,000 additional SKUs of slower-selling       products are available either through our vendor direct program (VDP), which       offers overnight delivery, or through our salvage auto parts and original       equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts programs.
We       are       constantly updating the products that we offer to assure that our inventory       matches the products that our customers demand.
Pricing We       want       to be perceived by our customers as the value leader in our industry by       consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price, backed by a       good       warranty and outstanding customer service. On many of our products we offer       multiple value choices in a good/better/best assortment, with appropriate price       and quality differences from the good products to the better and best products. A key component is our exclusive line of in-house brands: Valucraft,       AutoZone, Duralast and Duralast Gold. We believe that our overall prices and       value compare favorably to those of our competitors.
Marketing:       Advertising and Promotions We       believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in       succeeding in todays environment. We are constantly working to understand our       customers wants and needs so that we can build long-lasting, loyal       relationships. We utilize promotions and advertising primarily to advise       customers about the overall importance of vehicle maintenance, our great value       and the availability of high quality parts. Broadcast and targeted loyalty       efforts are our primary marketing methods of driving traffic to our stores.       We       utilize in-store signage and creative product placement to help educate       customers about products they need.
Store       Design and Visual Merchandising We       design       and build stores for a high visual impact. The typical AutoZone store utilizes       colorful exterior and interior signage, exposed beams and ductwork and brightly       lighted interiors. Maintenance products, accessories and miscellaneous items       are       attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers. In-store signage and       special displays promote products on floor displays, end caps and on the shelf.
Commercial Our       commercial sales program operates in a highly fragmented market and is one       of       the leading distributors of automotive parts and other products to local,       regional and national repair garages, dealers and service stations in the United       States. As a part of the program we offer credit and delivery to our commercial       customers. The program operated out of 2,182 stores as of August 25, 2007.       Through our hub stores, we offer a greater range of parts and products desired       by professional technicians, and this additional inventory is available for       our       DIY customers as well. We have a national sales team focused on national and       regional commercial accounts.
Store       Operations Store       Formats Substantially       all AutoZone stores are based on standard store formats, resulting in generally       consistent appearance, merchandising and product mix. Approximately 85% to       90%       of each stores square footage is selling space, of which approximately 40% to       45% is dedicated to hard parts inventory. The hard parts inventory area is       generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store,       dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store. The remaining       selling space contains displays of maintenance, accessories and non-automotive       items.
We       believe that our stores are destination stores, generating their own traffic       rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores. Therefore, we situate       most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking.
6 Store       Personnel and Training Each       store typically employs from 10 to 16 AutoZoners, including a manager and,       in       some cases, an assistant manager. AutoZoners typically have prior automotive       experience. All AutoZoners are encouraged to complete courses resulting in       certification by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence       (ASE), which is broadly recognized for training certification in the       automotive industry. Although we do on-the-job training, we also provide formal       training programs, including an annual national sales meeting, regular store       meetings on specific sales and product issues, standardized training manuals       and       a specialist program that provides training to AutoZoners in several areas       of       technical expertise from both the Company and from independent certification       agencies. Training is supplemented with frequent store visits by       management.
Store       managers receive financial incentives through performance-based bonuses. In       addition, our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified       AutoZoners. We believe these opportunities are important to attract, motivate       and retain high quality AutoZoners.
All       store       support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in       Memphis, Tennessee and Mexico. We believe that this centralization enhances       consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store       level, while reducing expenses and cost of sales.
Store       Automation All       of       our stores have Z-net TM ,       our       proprietary electronic catalog that enables our AutoZoners to efficiently look       up the parts our customers need and provides complete job solutions, advice       and       information for customer vehicles. Z-net TM provides       parts information based on the year, make, model and engine type of a vehicle       and also tracks inventory availability at the store, at other nearby stores       and       through special order. The Z-net TM display       screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods, where both AutoZoners       and       customers can view the screen. In addition, our wide area network enables the       stores to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes, to access       immediately national warranty data, to implement real-time inventory controls       and to locate and hold parts at neighboring AutoZone stores.
Our       stores utilize our computerized proprietary Store Management System, which       includes bar code scanning and point-of-sale data collection terminals. The       Store Management System provides administrative assistance and improved       personnel scheduling at the store level, as well as enhanced merchandising       information and improved inventory control. We believe the Store Management       System also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions       and simplified warranty and product return procedures.
Store       Development The       following table reflects store development during the past five fiscal       years: Fiscal                 Year 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Beginning                 Domestic Stores 3,771 3,592 3,420 3,219 3,068 New                 Stores 163 185 175 202 160 Closed                 Stores 1 6 3 1 9 Net                 New Stores 162 179 172 201 151 Relocated                 Stores 18 18 7 4 6 Ending                 Domestic Stores 3,933 3,771 3,592 3,420 3,219 Ending                 Mexico Stores 123 100 81 63 49 Ending                 Total Stores 4,056 3,871 3,673 3,483 3,268 The       domestic stores include stores in the United States and Puerto Rico. The new       store count in 2007 reflects 3 stores that were temporarily closed during fiscal       2006 and excluded from the prior year ending store count. We believe that       expansion opportunities exist both in markets that we do not currently serve,       as       well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence. We attempt to obtain       high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake substantial       research prior to entering new markets. The most important criteria for opening       a new store are its projected future profitability and its ability to achieve       our required investment hurdle rate. Key factors in selecting new site and       market locations include population, demographics, vehicle profile, number       and       strength of competitors stores and the cost of real estate. In reviewing the       vehicle profile, we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years       old and older- our kind of vehicles, as these are generally no longer under       the original manufacturers warranties and will require more maintenance and       repair than younger vehicles. We generally seek to open new stores within or       contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in       markets in a relatively short period of time. In addition to continuing to       lease       or develop our own stores, we evaluate and may make strategic       acquisitions.
7 Purchasing       and Supply Chain Merchandise       is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support centers       located in Memphis, Tennessee and Mexico. No one class of product accounts       for       as much as 10 percent of our total sales. In fiscal 2007, no single supplier       accounted for more than 10 percent of our total purchases. We generally have       few       long-term contracts for the purchase of merchandise. We believe that we have       good relationships with suppliers. We also believe that alternative sources       of       supply exist, at similar cost, for most types of product sold. Most of our       merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet       of       tractors and trailers or by third-party trucking firms.
Our       hub       stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis       to       many of our stores. A hub store is able to provide replenishment of products       sold and deliver other products maintained only in hub store inventories to       a       store in its coverage area generally within 24 hours. Hub stores are generally       replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week.
Competition The       sale       of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive       in       many areas, including name recognition, product availability, customer service,       store location and price. AutoZone competes in both the retail (DIY) and       commercial do-it-for-me (DIFM) auto parts and accessories       markets.
Competitors       include national and regional auto parts chains, independently owned parts       stores, wholesalers and jobbers, repair shops, car washes and auto dealers,       in       addition to discount and mass merchandise stores, department stores, hardware       stores, supermarkets, drugstores, convenience stores and home stores that sell       aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies, chemicals, accessories, tools and       maintenance parts. AutoZone competes on the basis of customer service, including       the trustworthy advice of our AutoZoners, merchandise selection and       availability, price, product warranty, store layouts and location.
Trademarks       and Patents We       have       registered several service marks and trademarks in the United States Patent       and       Trademark office as well as in certain other countries, including our service       marks, AutoZone and Get in the Zone, and trademarks, AutoZone, Duralast, Duralast Gold, Valucraft, ALLDATA and Z-net TM . We       believe that these service marks and trademarks are important components of       our       merchandising and marketing strategy.
Employees As       of       August 25, 2007, we employed approximately 55,000 persons, approximately 56       percent of whom were employed full-time. About 93 percent of our AutoZoners       were       employed in stores or in direct field supervision, approximately 5 percent       in       distribution centers and approximately 2 percent in store support functions.       Included in the above numbers are approximately 2,000 persons employed in our       Mexico operations.
We       have       never experienced any material labor disruption and believe that relations       with       our AutoZoners are generally good.

Item       1A. Risk Factors Our       business is subject to a variety of risks. Set forth below are certain of the       important risks that we face and that could cause actual results to differ       materially from historical results. These risks are not the only ones we face.       Our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently       unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our       business.
We       may not be able to increase sales by the same historic growth       rates.
We       have       increased our store count in the past five fiscal years, growing from 3,107       stores at August 31, 2002, to 4,056 stores at August 25, 2007, an average store       count increase per year of 5%. Additionally, we have increased annual revenues       in the past five fiscal years from $5.326 billion in fiscal 2002 to $6.170       billion in fiscal 2007, an average increase per year of 3%. Annual revenue       growth is driven by the opening of new stores and same-store sales. We cannot       provide any assurance that we can continue to open stores or increase same-store       sales.
Our       business depends upon qualified employees.
At       the       end of fiscal 2007, our consolidated employee count was approximately 55,000.       We       cannot assure that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at       current wage rates. If we do not maintain competitive wages, our customer       service could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce or,       alternatively, our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage       rates.
10 If       demand for our products slows, then our business may be materially       affected.
Demand       for products sold by our stores depends on many factors. In the short term,       it       may depend upon:  the                 number of miles vehicles are driven annually, as higher vehicle mileage                 increases the need for maintenance and repair. Mileage levels may                 be                 affected by gas prices and other                 factors.
the                 number of vehicles in current service that are seven years old and                 older,                 as these vehicles are no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers                 warranties and will need more maintenance and repair than younger                 vehicles.
the                 weather, as vehicle maintenance may be deferred.
the                 economy. In periods of rapidly declining economic conditions, both                 retail                 DIY and commercial DIFM customers may defer vehicle maintenance or                 repair.                 During periods of expansionary economic conditions, more of our DIY                 customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead                 of                 working on their own vehicles or they may purchase new vehicles.
For       the       long term, demand for our products may depend upon:  the                 quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers                 and the length of the warranty or maintenance offered on new                 vehicles.
restrictions                 on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the                 original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental                 regulation.
If       we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell       the products       that we sell, we could lose customers and our sales and profits       may decline.
The       sale       of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive       based on many factors, including name recognition, product availability,       customer service, store location and price. Competitors are rapidly opening       locations near our existing stores. AutoZone competes as a supplier in both       the       DIY and DIFM auto parts and accessories markets.
Competitors       include national, regional and local auto parts chains, independently owned       parts stores, jobbers, repair shops, car washes and auto dealers, in addition       to       discount and mass merchandise stores, department stores, hardware stores,       supermarkets, drugstores, convenience stores and home stores that sell       aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies, chemicals, accessories, tools and       maintenance parts. Although we believe we compete effectively on the basis       of       customer service, including the knowledge and expertise of our AutoZoners;       merchandise quality, selection and availability; product warranty; store layout,       location and convenience; price; and the strength of our AutoZone brand name,       trademarks and service marks; some competitors may have competitive advantages,       such as greater financial and marketing resources, larger stores with more       merchandise, longer operating histories, more frequent customer visits and       more       effective advertising. If we are unable to continue to develop successful       competitive strategies, or if our competitors develop more effective strategies,       we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline.
If       we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto       parts business,       our sales growth may be limited.
Although       we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market, to       increase commercial sales we must compete against national and regional auto       parts chains, independently owned parts stores, wholesalers and jobbers, repair       shops and auto dealers. Although we believe we compete effectively on the basis       of customer service, merchandise quality, selection and availability, price,       product warranty and distribution locations, and the strength of our AutoZone       brand name, trademarks and service marks, some automotive aftermarket jobbers       have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have,       have developed long-term customer relationships and have large available       inventories. We can make no assurances that we can profitably develop new       commercial customers or make available inventories required by commercial       customers.
11 If       our vendors continue to consolidate, we may pay higher prices for       our merchandise.
In       recent       years, several of our vendors have merged. Further vendor consolidation could       limit the number of vendors from which we may purchase products and could       materially affect the prices we pay for these products.
Consolidation       among our competitors may negatively impact our business.
If       our       competitors consolidate with other auto parts chains and are able to achieve       efficiencies in their mergers, then there may be greater competitive pressures       in the markets in which they are stronger.
War       or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may negatively       impact availability       of merchandise and adversely impact our sales.
War       or       acts of terrorism, or the threat of either, may have a negative impact on our       ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores. Some of our       merchandise is imported from other countries. If imported goods become difficult       or impossible to bring into the United States, and if we cannot obtain such       merchandise from other sources at similar costs, our sales and profit margins       may be negatively affected.
In       the       event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed,       our       business may be adversely impacted, as we may have difficulty shipping       merchandise to our distribution centers and stores.
Rising       energy prices may negatively impact our profitability.
As       mentioned above, rising energy prices may impact demand for the products that       we       sell, overall transaction count and our profitability. Higher energy prices       impact our merchandise distribution, commercial delivery, utility, and product       costs.
Demand       for our merchandise may decline if vehicle manufacturers refuse to make       available the information our customers need to work on their own       vehicles.
Demand       for our merchandise may decline if vehicle manufacturers refuse to make       available to the automotive aftermarket industry diagnostic, repair and       maintenance information that our customers, both retail (DIY) and commercial       (DIFM), require to diagnose, repair and maintain their vehicles. Without       public dissemination of this information, consumers may be forced to have all       diagnostic work, repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers'       dealer network.

Item       2. Properties The       following table reflects the square footage and number of leased and owned       properties for our stores as of August 25, 2007: No.                 of Stores Square                 Footage Leased 1,873 11,250,612 Owned 2,183 14,793,581 Total 4,056 26,044,193 We       have       over 3.4 million square feet in distribution centers servicing our stores,       of       which approximately 1.3 million square feet is leased and the remainder is       owned. Our distribution centers are located in Arizona, California, Georgia,       Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas and Mexico. Our primary store support center,       which we own, is located in Memphis, Tennessee, and consists of approximately       260,000 square feet. We also own and lease other properties that are not       material in the aggregate.
12 Item       3. Legal Proceedings AutoZone,       Inc. is a defendant in a lawsuit entitled "Coalition for a Level Playing Field,       L.L.C., et al., v. AutoZone, Inc. et al.," filed in the U.S. District Court       for       the Southern District of New York in October 2004. The case was filed by more       than 200 plaintiffs, which are principally automotive aftermarket warehouse       distributors and jobbers (collectively Plaintiffs), against a number of       defendants, including automotive aftermarket retailers and aftermarket       automotive parts manufacturers. In the amended complaint, the plaintiffs allege,       inter alia, that some or all of the automotive aftermarket retailer defendants       have knowingly received, in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act (the Act),       from various of the manufacturer defendants benefits such as volume discounts,       rebates, early buy allowances and other allowances, fees, inventory without       payment, sham advertising and promotional payments, a share in the       manufacturers' profits, benefits of pay on scan purchases, implementation of       radio frequency identification technology, and excessive payments for services       purportedly performed for the manufacturers. Additionally, a subset of       plaintiffs alleges a claim of fraud against the automotive aftermarket retailer       defendants based on discovery issues in a prior litigation involving similar       Robinson-Patman Act claims. In the prior litigation, the discovery dispute,       as       well as the underlying claims, were decided in favor of AutoZone and the other       automotive aftermarket retailer defendants who proceeded to trial, pursuant       to a       unanimous jury verdict which was affirmed by the Second Circuit Court of       Appeals. In the current litigation, plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of       damages (including statutory trebling), attorneys' fees, and a permanent       injunction prohibiting the aftermarket retailer defendants from inducing and/or       knowingly receiving discriminatory prices from any of the aftermarket       manufacturer defendants and from opening up any further stores to compete with       plaintiffs as long as defendants allegedly continue to violate the Act. The       Company believes this suit to be without merit and is vigorously defending       against it. Defendants have filed motions to dismiss all claims with prejudice       on substantive and procedural grounds. Additionally, the Defendants have sought       to enjoin plaintiffs from filing similar lawsuits in the future. If granted       in       their entirety, these dispositive motions would resolve the litigation in       Defendants' favor.
On       June       22, 2005, the Attorney General of the State of California, in conjunction with       District Attorneys for San Bernardino, San Joaquin and Monterey Counties, filed       suit in the San Bernardino County Superior Court against AutoZone, Inc. and       its       California subsidiaries. The San Diego County District Attorney later joined       the       suit. The lawsuit alleges that AutoZone failed to follow various state statutes       and regulation governing the storage and handling of used motor oil and other       materials collected for recycling or used for cleaning AutoZone stores and       parking lots. The suit sought $12 million in penalties and injunctive relief.       On       June 1, 2007, AutoZone and the State entered into a Stipulated Final Judgment       by       Consent. The Stipulated Final Judgment amended the suit to also allege weights       and measures (pricing) violations. Pursuant to this Judgment, AutoZone is       enjoined from committing these types of violations and agreed to pay civil       penalties in the amount of $1.8 million, including $1.5 million in cash and       a       $300,000 credit for work performed to insure compliance.
AutoZone       is involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of       our       business. Although the amount of liability that may result from these other       proceedings cannot be ascertained, we do not currently believe that, in the       aggregate, they will result in liabilities material to our financial condition,       results of operations, or cash flows.
Item       4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders Not       applicable.
13 PART       II Item       5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer       Purchases of Equity Securities AutoZones       common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AZO. On       October 15, 2007, there were 3,589 stockholders of record, which does not       include the number of beneficial owners whose shares were represented by       security position listings.
We       currently do not pay a cash dividend on our common stock. Any payment of       dividends in the future would be dependent upon our financial condition, capital       requirements, earnings, cash flow and other factors.

(5) The                 domestic comparable sales increases (decreases) are based on sales                 for all                 domestic stores open at least one                 year.
(6) Inventory                 turnover is calculated as cost of sales divided by the average of                 the                 beginning and ending recorded merchandise inventories, which excludes                 merchandise under pay-on-scan arrangements.

17 Item       7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and       Results of       Operations We       are       the nations leading specialty retailer and a leading distributor of automotive       parts and accessories, with most of our sales to do-it-yourself (DIY)       customers. We began operations in 1979 and as of August 25, 2007, operated       3,933       stores in the United States and Puerto Rico, and 123 in Mexico. Each of our       stores carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles,       vans       and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts,       maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products. In many of our       stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit       and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national       repair garages, dealers and service stations. We also sell the ALLDATA brand       automotive diagnostic and repair software. On the web, we sell diagnostic and       repair information and automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories,       and non-automotive products through www.autozone.com. We do not derive revenue       from automotive repair or installation.
Results       of Operations Fiscal       2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006 For       the       year ended August 25, 2007, AutoZone reported net sales of $6.170 billion       compared with $5.948 billion for the year ended August 26, 2006, a 3.7% increase       from fiscal 2006. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in the number       of open stores. At August 25, 2007, we operated 3,933 domestic stores and 123       in       Mexico, compared with 3,771 domestic stores and 100 in Mexico at August 26,       2006. Domestic retail sales increased 3.4% and domestic commercial sales       decreased 0.4% from prior year. ALLDATA and Mexico sales increased over prior       year, contributing 0.9 percentage points of the total increase in net sales.       Domestic same store sales, or sales for domestic stores open at least one year,       increased 0.1% from the prior year.
Gross       profit for fiscal 2007 was $3.064 billion, or 49.7% of net sales, compared       with       $2.939 billion, or 49.4% of net sales, for fiscal 2006. The improvement in       gross       profit margin was primarily attributable to ongoing category management       initiatives and supply chain efficiencies.
Operating,       selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2007 increased to $2.009       billion, or 32.6% of net sales, from $1.929 billion, or 32.4% of net sales       for       fiscal 2006.
The       increase in expenses is driven primarily by higher occupancy cost versus the       prior year.
Interest       expense, net for fiscal 2007 was $119.1 million compared with $107.9 million       during fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily due to higher short term rates       and higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period and       the recognition of interest expense on capital lease obligations that were       accounted for as operating leases prior to a modification to the lease       agreements in fiscal 2007. Average borrowings for fiscal 2007 were $1.972       billion, compared with $1.928 billion for fiscal 2006. Weighted average       borrowing rates were 5.7% at August 25, 2007, compared to 5.5% at August 26,       2006.
Our       effective income tax rate decreased to 36.4% of pre-tax income for fiscal 2007       as compared to 36.9% for fiscal 2006 primarily       due to benefits       from changes in our pre-tax earnings mix and an increase in certain federal       and       state tax credits.
Refer       to       "Note D - Income Taxes" for additional information regarding our income tax       rate.
Net       income for fiscal 2007 increased by 4.6% to $595.7 million, and diluted earnings       per share increased by 13.6% to $8.53 from $7.50 in fiscal 2006. The impact       of       the fiscal 2007 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2007       was an increase of approximately $0.14.
18 Fiscal       2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005 For       the       year ended August 26, 2006, AutoZone reported sales of $5.948 billion compared       with $5.711 billion for the year ended August 27, 2005, a 4.2% increase from       fiscal 2005. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in the number       of       open stores. At August 26, 2006, we operated 3,771 domestic stores and 100       in       Mexico, compared with 3,592 domestic stores and 81 in Mexico at August 27,       2005.       Domestic Retail sales increased 4.0% and domestic commercial sales decreased       1.3% from prior year. ALLDATA and Mexico sales increased over prior year,       contributing 0.9 percentage points of the total increase. Same store sales,       or       sales for domestic stores open at least one year, increased 0.4% from the prior       year.
Gross       profit for fiscal 2006 was $2.939 billion, or 49.4% of net sales, compared       with       $2.793 billion, or 48.9% of net sales, for fiscal 2005. The improvement in       gross       profit margin was primarily attributable to ongoing category management       initiatives, partially off-set by increases in certain commodity costs. Our       ongoing category management initiatives have included continued optimization       of       merchandise assortment and pricing, management of procurement costs, and an       increasing focus on direct importing initiatives.
Operating,       selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2006 increased to $1.929       billion, or 32.4% of net sales, from $1.817 billion, or 31.8% of net sales       for       fiscal 2005.
Expenses       for fiscal 2005 include a $40.3 million charge related to accounting for leases       (see Note J - Leases). Expenses for fiscal 2006 include $17.4 million in       share-based compensation expense resulting from the current year adoption of       Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment (see Note B - Share-Based Payments). The remaining increase in expenses is       driven by initiatives to improve the customers shopping experience and higher       occupancy costs driven largely by the opening of new stores. These initiatives       continue to include expanded hours of operation, enhanced training programs       and       ensuring clean, well-merchandised stores.
Interest       expense, net for fiscal 2006 was $107.9 million compared with $102.4 million       during fiscal 2005. This increase was due to a higher average borrowing rate,       partially offset by lower average borrowing levels. Average borrowings for       fiscal 2006 were $1.928 billion, compared with $1.970 billion for fiscal 2005.       Weighted average borrowing rates were 5.5% at August 26, 2006, compared to       5.2%       at August 27, 2005. The increase in interest rates reflects both the ongoing       effort to extend the terms of our borrowings, as well as the impact from       increased short-term rates.
Our       effective income tax rate increased to 36.9% of pre-tax income for fiscal 2006       as compared to 34.6% for fiscal 2005 .
The       fiscal 2005 effective income tax rate reflects $21.3 million in tax benefits       related to the repatriation of Mexican earnings as a result of the American       Jobs       Creation Act of 2004 (see Note D - Income Taxes), and other discrete income       tax items.
Net       income for fiscal 2006 decreased by 0.3% to $569.3 million, and diluted earnings       per share increased by 4.5% to $7.50 from $7.18 in fiscal 2005. The impact       of       the fiscal 2006 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2006       was an increase of approximately $0.09.
Seasonality       and Quarterly Periods AutoZones       business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales occurring in       the       spring and summer months of March through August, in which average weekly       per-store sales historically have been about 15% to 25% higher than in the       slower months of December through February. During short periods of time, a       stores sales can be affected by weather conditions. Extremely hot or extremely       cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail and spurring sales       of       seasonal products. Mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure       rates are lower in mild weather and elective maintenance is deferred during       periods of rainy weather. Over the longer term, the effects of weather balance       out, as we have stores throughout the United States and Mexico.
Each       of       the first three quarters of AutoZones fiscal year consists of 12 weeks, and the       fourth quarter consists of 16 weeks. Because the fourth quarter contains the       seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 weeks, compared with 12 weeks       for each of the first three quarters, our fourth quarter represents a       disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income. The fourth       quarter of fiscal 2007 represented 32.5% of annual sales and 36.5% of net       income; the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 represented 32.6% of annual sales       and       37.5% of net income; and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 represented 33.0%       of       annual sales and 36.2% of net income.
19 Liquidity       and Capital Resources Net       cash       provided by operating activities was $845.2 million in fiscal 2007, $822.7       million in fiscal 2006, and $648.1 million in fiscal 2005. The primary source       of       our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts       and accessories. Our new store development program requires working capital,       predominantly for inventories. During the past three fiscal years, we have       maintained an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 93% at August 25, 2007,       92%       at August 26, 2006, and 93% at August 27, 2005. The increase in merchandise       inventories, required to support new store development and sales growth, has       largely been financed by our vendors, as evidenced by our accounts payable       to       inventory ratio. Contributing to this ratio is the use of pay-on-scan (POS)       arrangements with certain vendors. Under a POS arrangement, AutoZone will not       purchase merchandise supplied by a vendor until that merchandise is ultimately       sold to AutoZones customers. Upon the sale of the merchandise to AutoZones       customers, AutoZone recognizes the liability for the goods and pays the vendor       in accordance with the agreed-upon terms. Revenues under POS arrangements are       included in net sales in the income statement. Since we do not own merchandise       under POS arrangements until just before it is sold to a customer, such       merchandise is not included in our balance sheet. Merchandise under POS       arrangements was $22.4 million at August 25, 2007.
AutoZones       primary capital requirement has been the funding of its continued new store       development program. From the beginning of fiscal 2005 to August 25, 2007,       we       have opened 573 net new stores. Net cash flows used in investing activities       were       $228.7 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $268.3 million in fiscal 2006 and       $282.8 million in fiscal 2005. We invested $224.5 million in capital assets       in       fiscal 2007, compared to $263.6 million in capital assets in fiscal 2006 and       $283.5 million in fiscal 2005. New store openings were 186 for fiscal 2007,       204       for fiscal 2006, and 193 for fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, we began investing       a portion of our assets held by the Companys wholly owned insurance captive in       marketable securities. We acquired $94.6 million of marketable securities in       fiscal 2007 and acquired $160.0 million in fiscal 2006. We had proceeds from       matured marketable securities of $86.9 million in fiscal 2007 and $145.4 million       in fiscal 2006. Capital asset disposals provided $3.5 million in fiscal 2007,       $9.8 million in fiscal 2006, and $3.8 million for fiscal 2005.
Net       cash       used in financing activities was $621.4 million in fiscal 2007, $537.7 million       in fiscal 2006, and $367.4 million in fiscal 2005. The net cash used in       financing activities is primarily attributable to purchases of treasury stock       which totaled $761.9 million for fiscal 2007, $578.1 million for fiscal 2006,       and $426.9 million for fiscal 2005. The treasury stock purchases in fiscal       2007,       2006 and 2005 were primarily funded by cash flow from operations, and at times,       by increases in debt levels.
We       expect       to invest in our business consistent with historical rates during fiscal 2008,       primarily related to our new store development program and enhancements to       existing stores and systems. In addition to the building and land costs, our       new       store development program requires working capital, predominantly for       inventories. Historically, we have negotiated extended payment terms from       suppliers, reducing the working capital required. We believe that we will be       able to continue to finance much of our inventory requirements through favorable       payment terms from suppliers.
Depending       on the timing and magnitude of our future investments (either in the form of       leased or purchased properties or acquisitions), we anticipate that we will       rely       primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to       support a majority of our capital expenditures, working capital requirements       and       stock repurchases. The balance may be funded through new borrowings. We       anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit       rating and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past.
Credit       Ratings At       August       25, 2007, AutoZone had a senior unsecured debt credit rating from Standard & Poors of BBB+ and a commercial paper rating of A-2. Moodys Investors Service       had assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of Baa2 and a commercial       paper rating of P-2. As of August 25, 2007, Moodys and Standard & Poors       had AutoZone listed as having a stable outlook. If our credit ratings drop,       our interest expense may increase; similarly, we anticipate that our interest       expense may decrease if our investment ratings are raised. If our commercial       paper ratings drop below current levels, we may have difficulty continuing       to       utilize the commercial paper market and our interest expense will increase,       as       we will then be required to access more expensive bank lines of credit. If       our       senior unsecured debt ratings drop below investment grade, our access to       financing may become more limited.
20 Debt       Facilities We       maintain $1.0 billion of revolving credit facilities with a group of banks       to       primarily support commercial paper borrowings, letters of credit and other       short-term unsecured bank loans. These facilities expire in May 2010, may be       increased to $1.3 billion at AutoZones election, may include up to $200 million       in letters of credit, and may include up to $100 million in capital leases.       As       the available balance is reduced by commercial paper borrowings and certain       outstanding letters of credit, the Company had $680.2 million in available       capacity under these facilities at August 25, 2007. The rate of interest payable       under the credit facilities is a function of Bank of Americas base rate or a       Eurodollar rate (each as defined in the facility agreements), or a combination       thereof.
Our       $300.0 million bank term loan entered in December 2004 was amended in April       2006       to have similar terms and conditions as the $1.0 billion credit facilities,       but       with a December 2009 maturity, and was further amended in August 2007 to reduce       the interest rate on Euro-dollar loans. That credit agreement with a group       of       banks provides for a term loan, which consists of, at our election, base rate       loans, Eurodollar loans or a combination thereof. The interest accrues on base       rate loans at a base rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate or       the       Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%. Interest accrues on Eurodollar loans at       a       defined Eurodollar rate plus the applicable percentage, which can range from       30       basis points to 90 basis points, depending upon our senior unsecured (non-credit       enhanced) long-term debt rating. Based on our ratings at August 25, 2007, the       applicable percentage on Eurodollar loans is 35 basis points. We may select       interest periods of one, two, three or six months for Eurodollar loans, subject       to availability. Interest is payable at the end of the selected interest period,       but no less frequently than quarterly. We entered into an interest rate swap       agreement on December 29, 2004, to effectively fix, based on current debt       ratings, the interest rate of the term loan at 4.4%. We have the option to       extend loans into subsequent interest period(s) or convert them into loans       of       another interest rate type. The entire unpaid principal amount of the term       loan       will be due and payable in full on December 23, 2009, when the facility       terminates. We may prepay the term loan in whole or in part at any time without       penalty, subject to reimbursement of the lenders breakage and redeployment       costs in the case of prepayment of Eurodollar borrowings.
During       April 2006, our $150.0 million Senior Notes maturing at that time were repaid       with an increase in commercial paper. On June8, 2006, we issued       $200.0million in 6.95% Senior Notes due 2016 under our existing shelf       registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on       August17, 2004. That shelf registration allowed us to sell up to $300       million in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes, including       repaying, redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt, and for working capital,       capital expenditures, new store openings, stock repurchases and acquisitions.       The remainder of the shelf registration was cancelled in February, 2007.
Our       borrowings under our Senior Notes arrangements contain minimal covenants,       primarily restrictions on liens. Under our other borrowing arrangements,       covenants include limitations on total indebtedness, restrictions on liens,       a       minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a provision where repayment obligations       may be accelerated if AutoZone experiences a change in control (as defined       in       the agreements). All of the repayment obligations under our borrowing       arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment       date       if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs. As of August 25, 2007,       we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance       with       all covenants.
Stock       Repurchases During       1998, the Company announced a program permitting the Company to repurchase       a       portion of its outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established       by       the Companys Board of Directors. The program was most recently amended in June       2007 to increase the repurchase authorization to $5.9 billion from $5.4 billion.       From January 1998 to August 25, 2007, the Company has repurchased a total of       99.3 million shares at an aggregate cost of $5.4 billion. The Company       repurchased 6.0 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of       $761.9 million during fiscal 2007, 6.2 million shares of its common stock at       an       aggregate cost of $578.1 million during fiscal 2006, and 4.8 million shares       of       its common stock at an aggregate cost of $426.9 million during fiscal       2005.
21 Financial       Commitments The       following table shows AutoZones significant contractual obligations as of       August 25, 2007: Total Payment                 Due by Period Contractual Less                 than Between Between Over                 5 (in                 thousands) Obligations 1                 year 1-3                 years 4-5                 years years Long-term                 debt (1) $ 1,935,618 $ 435,618 $ 300,000 $ 200,000 $ 1,000,000 Interest                 payments (2) 500,707 96,988 154,506 118,300 130,913 Operating                 leases (3) 1,312,252 171,163 291,970 214,984 634,135 Capital                 leases (4) 62,510 16,015 28,928 17,567  Self-insurance                 reserves (5) 141,815 45,727 45,283 22,415 28,390 Construction                 obligations 23,804 23,804    $ 3,976,706 $ 789,315 $ 820,687 $ 573,266 $ 1,793,438 (1) Long-term                 debt balances represent principal maturities, excluding interest.                 At                 August 25, 2007, debt balances due                 in less than one year of $435.6 million are classified as long-term                 in our                 consolidated financial statements, as                 we have the ability and intent to refinance them on a long-term                 basis.
(2) Represents                 obligations for interest payments on long-term debt, including the                 effect                 of interest rate hedges.
(3) Operating                 lease obligations include related interest and are inclusive of amounts                 accrued within deferred rent and closed store obligations reflected                 in our                 consolidated balance sheets.
(4) Capital                 lease obligations include related                 interest.
(5) The                 Company retains a significant portion of the risks associated with                 workers                 compensation, employee health, general and product liability, property,                 and automotive insurance. These amounts represent undiscounted estimates                 based on actuarial calculations. Although these obligations do not                 have                 scheduled maturities , the timing of future payments are predictable                 based                 upon historical patterns. Accordingly, the Company reflects the net                 present value of these obligations in its consolidated balance                 sheets.
We       have       other obligations reflected in our balance sheet that are not reflected in       the       table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities or due to the nature       of       the account. Therefore, the timing of these payments cannot be determined,       except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2008 that are included in current       liabilities.
We       have       certain contingent liabilities that are not accrued in our balance sheet in       accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.       These contingent liabilities are not included in the table above.
Off-Balance       Sheet Arrangements The       following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as       of       August 25, 2007.
(in                 thousands) Total Other Commitments Standby                 letters of credit $ 113,305 Surety                 bonds 11,286 $ 124,591 A       substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit (which are       primarily renewed on an annual basis) and surety bonds are used to cover       reimbursement obligations to our workers compensation carriers. There are no       additional contingent liabilities associated with them as the underlying       liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheet. The standby       letters of credit and surety bonds arrangements expire within one year, but       have       automatic renewal clauses.
In       conjunction with our commercial sales program, we offer credit to some of our       commercial customers. The majority of our receivables related to the credit       program are sold to a third party at a discount for cash with limited recourse.       AutoZone has recorded a reserve for this recourse. At August 25, 2007, the       receivables facility had an outstanding balance of $55.3 million and the balance       of the recourse reserve was $1.8 million.
22 We       have       entered into POS arrangements with certain vendors, whereby we will not purchase       merchandise supplied by a vendor until just before that merchandise is       ultimately sold to our customers. Title and certain risks of ownership remain       with the vendor until the merchandise is sold to our customers. Since we do       not       own merchandise under POS arrangements until just before it is sold to a       customer, such merchandise is not recorded on our balance sheet. Upon the sale       of the merchandise to our customers, we recognize the liability for the goods       and pay the vendor in accordance with the agreed-upon terms. Although we do       not       hold title to the goods, we do control pricing and have credit collection risk       and therefore, gross revenues under POS arrangements are included in net sales       in the income statement.
Sales       of       merchandise under POS arrangements approximated $170.0 million in fiscal 2007,       $390.0 million in fiscal 2006, and $460.0 million in fiscal 2005.
Merchandise       under POS arrangements was $22.4 million at August 25, 2007 and $92.1 million       at       August 26, 2006.
Value       of Pension Assets At       August       25, 2007, the fair market value of AutoZones pension assets was $161.2 million,       and the related accumulated benefit obligation was $161.1 million based on       a May       31, 2007 measurement date. On January 1, 2003, our defined benefit pension       plans       were frozen. Accordingly, plan participants earn no new benefits under the       plan       formulas, and no new participants may join the plans. The material assumptions       for fiscal 2007 are an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of       8.0%       and a discount rate of 6.25%. For additional information regarding AutoZones       qualified and non-qualified pension plans refer to Note I - Pensions and       Savings Plans in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial       Statements.
Reconciliation       of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Selected       Financial Data and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition       and Results of Operations include certain financial measures not derived in       accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These       non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information for determining       our       optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating       performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize       stockholders value.
Non-GAAP       financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP financial       measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating       performance, financial position or cash flows. However, we have presented the       non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe they provide additional information       to analyze or compare our operations. Furthermore, our management and       Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors use the abovementioned non-GAAP       financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results       and       to determine payments of performance-based compensation. We have included a       reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in       the       following reconciliation tables.
Reconciliation       of Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Cash Flow Before Share Repurchases       and Changes in Debt The       following table reconciles net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents       to cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt, which is presented       in       the Selected Financial Data.

After-tax return on invested capital is calculated as       after-tax operating profit (excluding rent) divided by average invested capital       (which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases). The ROIC percentages       are presented in the Selected Financial Data.

Long-term debt (in thousands) was $1,194,517 at August                 31,                 2002.
(2) Average                 equity is equal to the average of our stockholders equity measured at the                 end of the prior fiscal year and each of the 13 fiscal periods of                 the                 current fiscal year.

(3) Rent                 is multiplied by a factor of six to capitalize operating leases in                 the                 determination of pre-tax invested capital. This calculation excludes                 the                 impact from the cumulative lease accounting adjustments recorded                 in the                 second quarter of fiscal 2005.
(4) Average                 of the capital lease obligations relating to vehicle capital leases                 entered into at the beginning of fiscal 2007 is computed as the average                 over the trailing 13 periods. Rent expense associated with the vehicles                 prior to the conversion to capital leases is included in the rent                 for                 purposes of calculating return on invested                 capital.
24 Recent       Accounting Pronouncements The       Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48) in June 2006. The       interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes       recognized in financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting       for Income Taxes. FIN 48 will be effective for our fiscal year beginning August       26, 2007. The Company has not determined the effect, if any, that the adoption       of FIN 48 will have on the Companys financial position and results of       operations.
In       September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value       Measurements (SFAS 157). This new standard defines fair value, establishes a       framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles       (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 will       be       effective for AutoZone in fiscal 2009. The Company is still in the process       of       evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 157 will have on the Companys       financial position and results of operations.
On       September 29, 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 158, "Employers'       Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans -- An       Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R ("SFAS 158"). This new       standard requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial       position an asset for a plan's overfunded status or a liability for a plan's       underfunded status; (b) measure a plan's assets and its obligations that       determine its funded status as of the end of the employer's fiscal year (with       limited exceptions); and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined       benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur. Those       changes will be reported in comprehensive income. We adopted the recognition       and       disclosure provisions of SFAS 158 during 2007 and will adopt the measurement       date provisions in 2009. Please refer to Note I (Pension and Savings Plan)       for       further description of this adoption.
In       February 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option       for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159). This new standard       permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain       other items at fair value. SFAS 159 will be effective for AutoZone in fiscal       2009. The Company is still in the process of evaluating the impact, if any,       that       it will have on the Companys financial position and results of operations.
Critical       Accounting Policies Preparation       of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and       assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the       date       of the financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during       the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. In       the       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe our significant       accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.       Our       policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical       experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the       circumstances. Actual results could differ under different assumptions or       conditions. Our senior management has identified the critical accounting       policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions       and have discussed such policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of       Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial statements require       significant estimation or judgment: Inventory       and Cost of Sales We       state       our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out       (LIFO) method. Included in inventory are related purchasing, storage and       handling costs. Due to price deflation on the Companys merchandise purchases,       the Companys inventory balances are effectively maintained under the first-in,       first-out method as the Companys policy is not to write up inventory for       favorable LIFO adjustments, resulting in cost of sales being reflected at the       higher amount. Since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market       conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market.       The       nature of our inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal and       excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit.       We       provide reserves where less than full credit will be received for such returns       and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less       than recorded costs. Additionally, we reduce inventory for estimated losses       related to shrinkage. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified       by ongoing physical inventory counts.
25 Vendor       Allowances AutoZone       receives various payments and allowances from its vendors based on the volume       of       purchases or for services that AutoZone provides to the vendors. Monies received       from vendors include rebates, allowances and promotional funds. The amounts       to       be received are subject to purchase volumes and the terms of the vendor       agreements, which generally do not state an expiration date, but are subject       to       ongoing negotiations that may be impacted in the future based on changes in       market conditions, vendor marketing strategies and changes in the profitability       or sell-through of the related merchandise. The Companys level of advertising       and other operating, selling, general and administrative expenditures are not       dependent on vendor allowances.
Rebates       and other miscellaneous incentives are earned based on purchases or product       sales and are accrued ratably over the purchase or sale of the related product,       but only if it is reasonably certain that the required volume levels will be       reached. These monies are recorded as a reduction of inventories and are       recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the related inventories are       sold.
For       all       allowances and promotional funds earned under vendor funding, the Company       applies the guidance pursuant to the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-16,       Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Cash Consideration Received       from a Vendor (EITF 02-16), by recording the vendor funds as a reduction of       inventories that are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the       inventories are sold. The Companys vendor funding arrangements do not provide       for any reimbursement arrangements that are for specific, incremental,       identifiable costs that are permitted under EITF 02-16 for the funding to be       recorded as a reduction to advertising or other operating, selling, general       and       administrative expenses.
Impairments In       accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards       No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (SFAS       144), we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of long-lived       assets, such as property and equipment, covered by this standard annually and       more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying       value may not be recoverable. As part of the evaluation, we review performance       at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses       that should be considered for impairment. We compare the sum of the undiscounted       expected future cash flows with the carrying amounts of the assets.
Under       the       provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and       Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), we perform an annual test of goodwill to       compare the estimated fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount to determine       if any impairment exists. We perform the annual impairment assessment in the       fourth quarter of each fiscal year, unless circumstances dictate more frequent       assessments.
If       impairments are indicated by either of the above evaluations, the amount by       which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets       is       recognized as an impairment loss. Such evaluations require management to make       certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the evaluation       is performed, which could differ from actual results.
Self-Insurance We       retain       a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation,       vehicle, employee health, general and product liability and property losses.       Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed       and losses incurred but not yet reported. Through various methods, which include       analyses of historical trends and utilization of actuaries, the Company       estimates the costs of these risks. The actuarial estimated long-term portions       of these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value;       other liabilities are not discounted. We believe the amounts accrued are       adequate, although actual losses may differ from the amounts provided. We       maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain       risks.
Income       Taxes We       accrue       and pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of       the       various jurisdictions in which we operate. Income tax expense involves       management judgment as to the ultimate resolution of any tax matters in dispute       with state, federal and foreign tax authorities. Management believes the       resolution of the current open tax issues will not have a material impact on       our       consolidated financial statements.
26 Litigation       and Other Contingent Liabilities We       have       received claims related to and been notified that we are a defendant in a number       of legal proceedings resulting from our business, such as employment matters,       product liability claims and general liability claims related to our store       premises. We calculate contingent loss accruals using our best estimate of       our       probable and reasonably estimable contingent liabilities.
Pension       Obligation Prior       to       January 1, 2003, substantially all full-time employees were covered by a defined       benefit pension plan. The benefits under the plan were based on years of service       and the employees highest consecutive five-year average compensation. On       January 1, 2003, the plan was frozen. Accordingly, pension plan participants       will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will       join the pension plan. On January 1, 2003, the Companys supplemental defined       benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen.       Accordingly, plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula       and no new participants will join the pension plan. As the plan benefits are       frozen, the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted       by       increases in future compensation levels, but are impacted by actuarial       calculations using two key assumptions: i.
Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets: estimated by considering the composition of our asset portfolio, our historical       long-term investment performance and current market conditions.
ii.
Discount rate used to determine benefit obligations: adjusted       annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds       as of the measurement date (May 31) using yields for maturities that are in       line       with the duration of our pension liabilities. This same discount rate is also       used to determine pension expense for the following plan year. If such       assumptions differ materially from actual experience, the impact could be       material to our financial statements.
Item       7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market       Risk AutoZone       is exposed to market risk from, among other things, changes in interest rates,       foreign exchange rates and fuel prices. From time to time, we use various       financial instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks. To date,       based upon our current level of foreign operations, hedging costs and past       changes in the associated foreign exchange rates, no derivative instruments       have       been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk. All of our hedging       activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by our Board of       Directors. Further, we do not buy or sell financial instruments for trading       purposes.
Interest       Rate Risk AutoZones       financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates. At       times, we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into       various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts,       treasury lock agreements and forward-starting interest rate swaps.
AutoZone       has historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt       to       fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances. We reflect       the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments in our       consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets. All of the Companys       interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. We had       an       outstanding interest rate swap with a fair value of $5.8 million at August       25,       2007, and $10.2 million at August 26, 2006, to effectively fix the interest       rate       on the $300.0 million term loan entered into during December 2004.
The       related gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income or loss. These deferred       gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest       expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are       recognized in expense. However, to the extent that the change in value of an       interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the       value       of the cash flow being hedged, that ineffective portion is immediately       recognized in income. The Companys hedge instrument was determined to be highly       effective as of August 25, 2007.
27 The       fair       value of our debt was estimated at $1.928 billion as of August 25, 2007, and       $1.825 billion as of August 26, 2006, based on the quoted market prices for       the       same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to AutoZone for       debt having the same remaining maturities. Such fair value is less than the       carrying value of debt by $7.6 million at August 25, 2007, and less than the       carrying value of debt by $32.3 million at August 26, 2006. Considering the       effect of any interest rate swaps designated and effective as cash flow hedges,       we had $245.6 million of variable rate debt outstanding at August 25, 2007,       and       $167.2 million of variable rate debt outstanding at August 26, 2006. At these       borrowing levels for variable rate debt, a one percentage point increase in       interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pre-tax earnings       and       cash flows of $2.5 million in 2007 and $1.7 million in 2006, which includes       the       effects of interest rate swaps. The primary interest rate exposure on variable       rate debt is based on LIBOR. Considering the effect of any interest rate swaps       designated and effective as cash flow hedges, we had outstanding fixed rate       debt       of $1.690 billion at August 25, 2007, and at August 26, 2006. A one percentage       point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate       debt by $60.8 million at August 25, 2007, and $68.3 million at August 26,       2006.
Fuel       Price Risk Fuel       swap       contracts that we utilize have not previously been designated as hedging       instruments under the provisions of SFAS 133 and thus do not qualify for hedge       accounting treatment, although the instruments were executed to economically       hedge a portion of our diesel fuel and unleaded fuel exposure. As of August       25,       2007, the then current months fuel swap contract was outstanding with a       settlement date of August 31, 2007. During fiscal 2007 and 2005, we entered       into       fuel swaps to economically hedge a portion of our diesel fuel exposure. These       swaps were settled within a few days of each fiscal year end and had no       significant impact on cost of sales for the 2007 or 2005 fiscal years. We did       not enter into any fuel swap contracts during fiscal 2006.
28 Item       8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Index Managements                 Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 30 Reports                 of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 31 Consolidated                 Statements of Income 33 Consolidated                 Balance Sheets 34 Consolidated                 Statements of Cash Flows 35 Consolidated                 Statements of Stockholders Equity 36 Notes                 to Consolidated Financial Statements 37 Quarterly                 Summary (unaudited) 56 29 Managements       Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our       management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal       control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)       under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our internal control       over financial reporting includes, among other things, defined policies and       procedures for conducting and governing our business, sophisticated information       systems for processing transactions and properly trained staff. Mechanisms       are       in place to monitor the effectiveness of our internal control over financial       reporting, including regular testing performed by the Companys internal audit       team, which is comprised of both Deloitte & Touche LLP professionals and       Company personnel. Actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are       identified. Our procedures for financial reporting include the active       involvement of senior management, our Audit Committee and a staff of highly       qualified financial and legal professionals.
Management,       with the participation of our principal executive and financial officers,       assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of August 25, 2007,       the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria       established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of       Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
Based       on       this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over       financial reporting was effective as of August 25, 2007.
Our       independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, audited       the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Ernst & Young has issued their report concurring with managements assessment, which is       included in this Annual Report.
Certifications Compliance       with NYSE Corporate Governance Listing Standards On       January 12, 2007, the Company submitted to the New York Stock Exchange the       Annual CEO Certification required pursuant to Section 303A.12(a) of the New       York       Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual.
Rule       13a-14(a) Certifications of Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial       Officer The       Company has filed, as exhibits to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal       year ended August 25, 2007, the certifications of its Principal Executive       Officer and Principal Financial Officer required pursuant to Section 302 of       the       Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2004.
30 Report       of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The       Board of Directors and Stockholders of AutoZone, Inc.
We       have       audited AutoZone, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of August       25, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework       issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission       (the COSO criteria). AutoZone, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining       effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment       of       the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in       the       accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.       Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control       over financial reporting based on our audit.
We       conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company       Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we       plan       and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective       internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material       respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control       over       financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing       and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based       on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered       necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable       basis for our opinion.
A       companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to       provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting       and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance       with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over       financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain       to       the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly       reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)       provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to       permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted       accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are       being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors       of       the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely       detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys       assets that could have a material effect on the financial       statements.
Because       of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may       not       prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of       effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become       inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance       with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We       have       audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AutoZone, Inc. as of       August 25, 2007 and August 26, 2006 and the related consolidated statements       of       income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in       the       period ended August 25, 2007. These financial statements are the responsibility       of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on       these financial statements based on our audits.
We       conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company       Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we       plan       and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial       statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,       on a       test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial       statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used       and       significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall       financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a       reasonable basis for our opinion.
In       our       opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all       material respects, the consolidated financial position of AutoZone, Inc. as       of       August 25, 2007 and August 26, 2006, and the consolidated results of its       operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended       August 25, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting       principles.

36 Notes       to Consolidated Financial Statements Note       A - Significant Accounting Policies Business: AutoZone,       Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (AutoZone or the Company) is       principally a retailer and distributor of automotive parts and accessories.       At       the end of fiscal 2007, the Company operated 3,933 domestic stores in the United       States and Puerto Rico, and 123 stores in Mexico. Each store carries an       extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks,       including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items,       accessories and non-automotive products. Many of the stores have a commercial       sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts       and       other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers and       service stations. The Company also sells the ALLDATA brand automotive diagnostic       and repair software. On the web at www.autozone.com, the Company sells       diagnostic and repair information, auto and light truck parts, and accessories.
Fiscal       Year: The       Companys fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday in       August.
Basis       of Presentation: The       consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AutoZone, Inc. and       its       wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and       balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use       of Estimates: Management       of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the       reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities       to prepare these financial statements. Actual results could differ from those       estimates.
Cash       Equivalents: Cash       equivalents consist of investments with original maturities of 90 days or less       at the date of purchase. Excluded from cash equivalents are investments in       money       market accounts, held by the Companys wholly owned insurance captive that was       established during fiscal 2004. These investments approximated $5.2 million       at       August 25, 2007, and $8.0 million at August 26, 2006. They are included within       the other current assets caption and are recorded at cost, which approximates       market value, due to the short maturity of the investments. Also included in       cash equivalents are proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions with       settlement terms of less than 5 days. Credit and debit card receivables included       within cash equivalents were $22.7 million at August 25, 2007 and $21.6 million       at August 26, 2006.
Marketable       Securities: During       fiscal 2006, the Company began investing a portion of its assets held by the       Companys wholly owned insurance captive in marketable debt securities. The       Company accounts for these securities in accordance with Statement of Financial       Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in       Debt and Equity Securities (SFAS 115) and accordingly, classifies them as       available-for-sale. The Company includes the securities within the other current       assets caption and records the amounts at fair market value, which is determined       using quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. Unrealized gains       and losses on these marketable securities are recorded in accumulated other       comprehensive income, net of tax.
The       Companys available-for-sale financial instruments consisted of the following       at: (in                   thousands) Amortized                   Cost Basis Gross                   Unrealized Gains Gross                   Unrealized Losses Fair Market                   Value August                   25, 2007 $ 57,245 $ 33 $ (152 ) $ 57,126 August                   26, 2006 $ 46,801 $ 13 $ (292 ) $ 46,522 The       debt       securities held at August 25, 2007, had contractual maturities ranging from       less       than one year to approximately 2 years. The Company did not realize any material       gains or losses on its marketable securities during fiscal 2007. Prior to 2006,       the Company did not invest in any securities required to be accounted for under       SFAS 115.
37 Accounts       Receivable: Accounts       receivable consists of receivables from customers and vendors, and are presented       net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts. AutoZone routinely grants credit       to certain of its commercial customers. The risk of credit loss in its trade       receivables is substantially mitigated by the Companys credit evaluation       process, short collection terms and sales to a large number of customers, as       well as the low revenue per transaction for most of its sales. Allowances for       potential credit losses are determined based on historical experience and       current evaluation of the composition of accounts receivable. Historically,       credit losses have been within managements expectations and the allowances for       uncollectible accounts were $17.7 million at August 25, 2007, and $13.7 million       at August 26, 2006. The Company routinely sells the majority of its receivables       to a third party at a discount for cash with limited recourse. AutoZone has       recorded a $1.8 million recourse reserve related to the $55.3 million in       outstanding factored receivables at August 25, 2007. The recourse reserve at       August 26, 2006 approximated $1.0 million related to the $53.4 million in       outstanding factored receivables.
Merchandise       Inventories: Inventories       are stated at the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out (LIFO)       method. Included in inventory are related purchasing, storage and handling       costs. Due to price deflation on the Companys merchandise purchases, the       Companys inventory balances are effectively maintained under the first-in,       first-out method as the Companys policy is not to write up inventory for       favorable LIFO adjustments, resulting in cost of sales being reflected at the       higher amount. The cumulative balance of this unrecorded adjustment, which       will       be reduced upon experiencing price inflation on our merchandise purchases,       was       $227.9 million at August 25, 2007, and $198.3 million at August 26,       2006.
AutoZone       has entered into pay-on-scan (POS) arrangements with certain vendors, whereby       AutoZone will not purchase merchandise supplied by a vendor until that       merchandise is ultimately sold to AutoZones customers. Title and certain risks       of ownership remain with the vendor until the merchandise is sold to AutoZones       customers. Since the Company does not own merchandise under POS arrangements       until just before it is sold to a customer, such merchandise is not recorded       in       the Companys balance sheet. Upon the sale of the merchandise to AutoZones       customers, AutoZone recognizes the liability for the goods and pays the vendor       in accordance with the agreed-upon terms. Although AutoZone does not hold title       to the goods, AutoZone controls pricing and has credit collection risk and       therefore, gross revenues under POS arrangements are included in net sales       in       the income statement. Sales of merchandise under POS arrangements approximated       $170.0 million in fiscal 2007, $390.0 million in fiscal 2006, and $460.0 million       in fiscal 2005. Merchandise under POS arrangements was $22.4 million at August       25, 2007 and $92.1 million at August 26, 2006.
Property       and Equipment: Property       and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed       principally using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful       lives: buildings, 40 to 50 years; building improvements, 5 to 15 years;       equipment, 3 to 10 years; and leasehold improvements, over the shorter of the       assets estimated useful life or the remaining lease term, which includes any       reasonably assured renewal periods. Depreciation and amortization include       amortization of assets under capital lease.
Impairment       of Long-Lived Assets: In       accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards       No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (SFAS       144), the Company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amounts of the       assets covered by this standard annually and more frequently if events or       changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be       recoverable. As part of the evaluation, the Company reviews performance at       the       store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that       should be considered for impairment. The Company compares the sum of the       undiscounted expected future cash flows with the carrying amounts of the assets.       If impairments are indicated, the amount by which the carrying amount of the       assets exceeds the fair value of the assets is recognized as an impairment       loss       where fair value is estimated based on discounted cash flows. No significant       impairment losses were recorded in the three years ended August 25,       2007.
Goodwill: The       cost       in excess of fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired is       recorded as goodwill. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of       Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), goodwill has not been amortized since fiscal 2001, but an analysis       is performed at least annually to compare the fair value of the reporting unit       to the carrying amount to determine if any impairment exists. The Company       performs its annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal       year, unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments. No impairment       losses were recorded in the three years ended August 25, 2007.
38 Derivative       Instruments and Hedging Activities: AutoZone       is exposed to market risk from, among other things, changes in interest rates,       foreign exchange rates and fuel prices. From time to time, the Company uses       various financial instruments to reduce such risks. To date, based upon the       Companys current level of foreign operations, hedging costs and past changes in       the associated foreign exchange rates, no derivative instruments have been       utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk. All of the Companys hedging       activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by AutoZones Board of       Directors. Further, the Company does not buy or sell financial instruments       for       trading purposes.
AutoZones       financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates. At       times, AutoZone reduces its exposure to changes in interest rates by entering       into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap       contracts, treasury lock agreements and forward-starting interest rate swaps.       The Company complies with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Nos.       133,       137, 138 and 149 (collectively SFAS 133) pertaining to the accounting for       these derivatives and hedging activities which require all such interest rate       hedge instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. All of       the       Companys interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges.       Refer to Note E - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for additional       disclosures regarding the Companys derivative instruments and hedging       activities. Cash flows related to these instruments designated as qualifying       hedges are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows       in the same categories as the cash flows from the items being hedged.       Accordingly, cash flows relating to the settlement of interest rate derivatives       hedging the forecasted issuance of debt have been reflected upon settlement       as a       component of financing cash flows. The resulting gain or loss from such       settlement is deferred to other comprehensive loss and reclassified to interest       expense over the term of the underlying debt. This reclassification of the       deferred gains and losses impacts the interest expense recognized on the       underlying debt that was hedged and is therefore reflected as a component of       operating cash flows in periods subsequent to settlement. The periodic       settlement of interest rate derivatives hedging outstanding variable rate debt       is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense and is therefore reflected       as a       component of operating cash flows.
Foreign       Currency: The       Company accounts for its Mexican operations using the Mexican peso as the       functional currency and converts its financial statements from Mexican pesos       to       U.S. dollars in accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. The       cumulative loss on currency translation is recorded as a component of       accumulated other comprehensive loss and approximated $15.8 million at August       25, 2007 and $12.5 million at August 26, 2006.
Self-Insurance       Reserves: The       Company retains a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation, employee health, general, products liability, property and       automotive insurance. Through various methods, which include analyses of       historical trends and utilization of actuaries, the Company estimates the costs       of these risks. The actuarial estimated long-term portions of these liabilities       are recorded at our estimate of their net present value.
Deferred       Rent: The       Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the course of       the       lease term, which includes any reasonably assured renewal periods, beginning       on       the date the Company takes physical possession of the property (see Note J -       Leases). Differences between this calculated expense and cash payments are       recorded as a liability in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the       accompanying balance sheet. This deferred rent approximated $42.6 million as       of       August 25, 2007 and $31.1 million as of August 26, 2006.
Financial       Instruments: The       Company has financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts       receivable, other current assets and accounts payable. The carrying amounts       of       these financial instruments approximate fair value because of their short       maturities. A discussion of the carrying values and fair values of the Companys       debt is included in Note F - Financing, marketable securities is included in Note A - Marketable Securities, and derivatives is included in Note E-       Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
Income       Taxes: The       Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method. Deferred tax       assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial       reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the       enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are       expected to reverse.
39 Sales       and Use Taxes: Governmental       authorities assess sales and use taxes on the sale of goods and services. The       Company excludes taxes collected from customers in its reported sales results;       such amounts are reflected as accrued expenses and other until remitted to       the       taxing authorities.
Revenue       Recognition: The       Company recognizes sales at the time the sale is made and the product is       delivered to the customer. Revenue from sales are presented net of allowances       for estimated sales returns, which are based on historical return       rates.
A       portion       of the Company's transactions include the sale of auto parts that contain a       core       component. The core component represents the recyclable portion of the auto       part. Customers are not charged for the core component of the new part if a       used       core is returned at the point of sale of the new part; otherwise the Company       charges customers a specified amount for the core component. The Company refunds       that same amount upon the customer returning a used core to the store at a       later       date. The Company does not recognize sales or cost of sales for the core       component of these transactions when a used part is returned or expected to       be       returned from the customer.
Vendor       Allowances and Advertising Costs: The       Company receives various payments and allowances from its vendors based on       the       volume of purchases and for services that AutoZone provides to the vendors.       Monies received from vendors include rebates, allowances and promotional funds.       The amounts to be received are subject to purchase volumes and the terms of       the       vendor agreements, which generally do not state an expiration date, but are       subject to ongoing negotiations that may be impacted in the future based on       changes in market conditions, vendor marketing strategies and changes in the       profitability or sell-through of the related merchandise. The Companys level of       advertising and other operating, selling, general and administrative       expenditures are not dependent on vendor allowances.
Rebates       and other miscellaneous incentives are earned based on purchases or product       sales and are accrued ratably over the purchase or sale of the related product,       but only if it is reasonably certain that the required volume levels will be       reached. These monies are recorded as a reduction of inventories and are       recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the related inventories are sold.
For       all       allowances and promotional funds earned under vendor funding, the Company       applies the guidance pursuant to the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-16,       Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Cash Consideration Received       from a Vendor (EITF 02-16), by recording the vendor funds as a reduction of       inventories that are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the       inventories are sold. The Companys vendor funding arrangements do not provide       for any reimbursement arrangements that are for specific, incremental,       identifiable costs that are permitted under EITF 02-16 for the funding to be       recorded as a reduction to advertising or other operating, selling, general       and       administrative expenses.
Advertising       expense was approximately $85.9 million in fiscal 2007, $78.1 million in fiscal       2006, and $90.3 million in fiscal 2005. The Company expenses advertising costs       as incurred.
Warranty       Costs: The       Company or the vendors supplying its products provide its customers with limited       warranties on certain products. Estimated warranty obligations for which the       Company is responsible are based on historical experience, provided at the       time       of sale of the product, and charged to cost of sales.
Shipping       and Handling Costs: The       Company does not generally charge customers separately for shipping and       handling. Substantially all the cost the Company incurs to ship products to       our       stores is included in cost of sales.
Pre-opening       Expenses: Pre-opening       expenses, which consist primarily of payroll and occupancy costs, are expensed       as incurred.
Earnings       Per Share: Basic       earnings per share is based on the weighted average outstanding common shares.       Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average outstanding shares       adjusted for the effect of common stock equivalents, which are primarily stock       options. Stock options that were not included in the diluted computation because       they would have been anti-dilutive were approximately 8,000 shares at August       25,       2007, 700,000 shares at August 26, 2006, and 1.0 million shares at August 27,       2005.
40 Stock       Options: At       August       25, 2007, the Company has stock option plans that provide for the purchase       of       the Companys common stock by certain of its employees and directors, which are       described more fully in Note B - Share-Based Payments. Effective August 28,       2005, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R)       Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)) and began recognizing compensation expense       for its share-based payments based on the fair value of the awards. See Note B       - Share-Based Payments for further discussion.
Recent       Accounting Pronouncements: The       Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48) in June 2006. The       interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes       recognized in financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting       for Income Taxes. FIN 48 will be effective for AutoZones fiscal year beginning       August 26, 2007. The Company has not determined the effect, if any, that the       adoption of FIN 48 will have on the Companys financial position and results of       operations.
In       September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value       Measurements (SFAS 157). This new standard defines fair value, establishes a       framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles       (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 will       be       effective for AutoZone in fiscal 2009. The Company is still in the process       of       evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 157 will have on the Companys       financial position and results of operations.
On       September 29, 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 158, "Employers'       Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans -- An       Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R" ("SFAS 158"). This       new       standard requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial       position an asset for a plan's overfunded status or a liability for a plan's       underfunded status and (b) measure a plan's assets and its obligations that       determine its funded status as of the end of the employer's fiscal year (with       limited exceptions). Those changes will be reported in comprehensive income.       The       Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS 158 during       2007 and will adopt the measurement date provisions in 2009. Please refer to       Note I (Pension and Savings Plan) for further description of this adoption.
In       February 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option       for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159). This new standard       permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain       other items at fair value. SFAS 159 will be effective for AutoZone in fiscal       2009. The Company is still in the process of evaluating the impact, if any,       that       it will have on the Companys financial position and results of operations.
Note       B - Share-Based Payments Effective       August 28, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS 123(R) and began recognizing       compensation expense for its share-based payments based on the fair value of       the       awards. Share-based payments include stock option grants and certain       transactions under the Companys other stock plans. Prior to August 28, 2005,       the Company accounted for share-based payments using the intrinsic-value-based       recognition method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No.       25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and SFAS No. 123, Accounting       for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123). As options were granted at an       exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on       the       date of grant, no stock-based employee compensation cost was reflected in net       income prior to adopting SFAS 123(R). As the Company adopted SFAS 123(R) under       the modified-prospective-transition method, results from prior periods have       not       been restated.
In       accordance with SFAS 123(R), share-based compensation expense recognized since       August 27, 2005, is based on the following: a) grant date fair value estimated       in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123 for unvested options       granted prior to the adoption date; b) grant date fair value estimated in       accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R) for options granted subsequent       to       the adoption date; and c) the discount on shares sold to employees under       employee stock purchase plans post-adoption, which represents the difference       between the grant date fair value and the employee purchase price.
Total       share-based expense (a component of operating, selling, general and       administrative expenses) was $18.5 million related to stock options and share       purchase plans for fiscal 2007 and $17.4 million in the previous year. Beginning       in fiscal 2006, excess tax benefits, tax deductions in excess of recognized       compensation cost, are classified as a financing cash inflow in accordance       with       SFAS 123(R).
41 The       following sentence illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share       if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123       for       fiscal 2005. For fiscal 2005, the Company had net income of $571.0 million,       pro-forma stock-based employee compensation expense of $11.3 million, pro-forma       net income of $559.8 million and pro-forma basic and diluted EPS of $7.12 and       $7.03, respectively. The value of the options was estimated using the       Black-Scholes-Merton multiple option pricing model for the option grants.
Under       SFAS 123(R), forfeitures are estimated at the time of valuation and reduce       expense ratably over the vesting period. This estimate is adjusted periodically       based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to       differ, from the previous estimate. Under SFAS 123 and APB 25, the Company       elected to account for forfeitures when awards were actually forfeited, at       which       time all previous pro forma expense disclosed for the forfeited awards ($7.3       million in fiscal 2005) was reversed to reduce pro forma expense for that       period.
AutoZone       grants options to purchase common stock to certain of its employees and       directors under various plans at prices equal to the market value of the stock       on the dates the options were granted. Options have a term of 10 years or 10       years and one day from grant date. Director options generally vest three years       from grant date. Employee options generally vest in equal annual installments       on       the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date. Employees       and directors generally have 30 days after the service relationship ends, or       one       year after death, to exercise all vested options. The fair value of each option       grant is separately estimated for each vesting date. The fair value of each       option is amortized into compensation expense on a straight-line basis between       the grant date for the award and each vesting date. The Company has estimated       the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by       applying the Black-Scholes-Merton multiple-option pricing valuation model.       The       application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental       and       highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense.
The       weighted average for key assumptions used in determining the fair value of       options granted and a summary of the methodology applied to develop each       assumption are as follows: Year                 Ended August                 25, 2007 August                 26, 2006 August                 27, 2005 Expected                 price volatility 26 % 35 % 36 % Risk-free                 interest rates 4.6 % 4.1 % 2.8 % Weighted                 average expected lives in years 3.9 3.3 3.5 Forfeiture                 rate 10 % 10 % n/a Dividend                 yield 0 % 0 % 0 % Expected       Price Volatility - This is       a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to       fluctuate. We use actual historical changes in the market value of our stock       to       calculate the volatility assumption as it is managements belief that this is       the best indicator of future volatility. We calculate daily market value changes       from the date of grant over a past period representative of the expected life       of       the options to determine volatility. An increase in the expected volatility       will       increase compensation expense.
Risk-Free       Interest Rate - This is       the U.S. Treasury rate for the week of the grant having a term equal to the       expected life of the option. An increase in the risk-free interest rate will       increase compensation expense.
Expected       Lives - This is       the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain       outstanding and is based on historical experience. Separate groups of employees       that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for       valuation purposes. Options granted have a maximum term of ten years or ten       years and one day. An increase in the expected life will increase compensation       expense.
42 Forfeiture       Rate - This is       the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited       or       canceled before becoming fully vested. This estimate is based on historical       experience. An increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation       expense.
Dividend       Yield - The       Company has not made any dividend payments nor does it have plans to pay       dividends in the foreseeable future. An increase in the dividend yield will       decrease compensation expense.
The       Company generally issues new shares when options are exercised. A summary of       outstanding stock options is as follows: Number of                 Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding                 August 28, 2004 5,011,706 $ 54.42 Granted 1,099,465 77.74 Exercised (1,741,312 ) 38.85 Canceled (532,373 ) 70.91 Outstanding                 August 27, 2005 3,837,486 65.87 Granted 749,452 82.75 Exercised (737,515 ) 54.48 Canceled (493,881 ) 75.49 Outstanding                 August 26, 2006 3,355,542 70.73 Granted 695,298 104.64 Exercised (934,677 ) 66.90 Canceled (159,398 ) 83.19 Outstanding                 August 25, 2007 2,956,765 $ 79.24 The       following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at August       25, 2007: Options                   Outstanding Options                   Exercisable Range                   of Exercise Prices Number Outstanding Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average                   Remaining Contractual Life (in                   Years) Number Exercisable Weighted Average Exercise Price $22.00                   - $75.64 1,181,091 $ 58.44 5.04 884,233 $ 52.67 $82.00                   - $89.18 987,334 85.35 7.16 387,969 87.12 $89.30                   - $103.44 744,262 101.59 8.89 40,000 95.32 $116.35                   - 129.63 44,078 122.43 9.47   $22.00                   - $129.63 2,956,765 $ 79.24 6.78 1,312,202 $ 64.15 At       August       25, 2007, the aggregate intrinsic value of all outstanding options was $130       million with a weighted average remaining contractual term of 6.8 years, of       which 1,312,202 of the outstanding options are currently exercisable with an       aggregate intrinsic value of $77.6 million, a weighted average exercise price       of       $64.15 and a weighted average remaining contractual term of 5.1 years. Shares       reserved for future option grants approximated 4.6 million at August 25, 2007.       The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted was $29.04 during       fiscal 2007 and $22.86 during fiscal 2006. The intrinsic value of options       exercised was $47 million in fiscal 2007 and $27 million in fiscal 2006.
Under       the       AutoZone, Inc. 2003 Director Compensation Plan, a non-employee director may       receive no more than one-half of his or her director fees immediately in cash,       and the remainder of the fees must be taken in common stock or may be deferred       in units with value equivalent to the value of shares of common stock as of       the       grant date (Stock Units). At August 25, 2007, the Company has $2.6 million       accrued related to 21,323 director units issued under the current and prior       plans with 84,681 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under       the       current plan.
43 Under       the       AutoZone, Inc. 2003 Director Stock Option Plan, each non-employee director       receives an option to purchase 1,500 shares of common stock on January 1 of       each       year, and each director who owns common stock or Stock Units worth at least       five       times the annual retainer fee receives an additional option to purchase 1,500       shares. In addition, each new director receives an option to purchase 3,000       shares upon election to the Board of Directors, plus a portion of the annual       directors option grant prorated for the portion of the year actually served in       office. These stock option grants are made at the fair market value as of the       grant date. At August 25, 2007, there were 95,552 outstanding options with       287,948 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under this       plan.
During       June, 2007, the Board of Directors approved certain changes to the Director       Compensation Plan and Director Stock Option Plan. For further discussion on       the       changes, see the Proxy Statement for Annual Meeting of Stockholders on December       12, 2007.
The       Company recognized $1.1 million in expense related to the discount on the       selling of shares to employees and executives under various share purchase       plans       in fiscal 2007 and $884,000 in the prior year. The employee stock purchase       plan,       which is qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code, permits       all       eligible employees to purchase AutoZones common stock at 85% of the lower of       the market price of the common stock on the first day or last day of each       calendar quarter through payroll deductions. Maximum permitted annual purchases       are $15,000 per employee or 10 percent of compensation, whichever is less.       Under       the plan, 39,139 shares were sold to employees in fiscal 2007, 51,167 shares       were sold to employees in fiscal 2006, and 59,479 shares were sold in fiscal       2005. The Company repurchased 65,152 shares at fair value in fiscal 2007, 62,293       shares at fair value in fiscal 2006, and 87,974 shares in fiscal 2005 from       employees electing to sell their stock. Issuances of shares under the employee       stock purchase plans are netted against repurchases and such repurchases are       not       included in share repurchases disclosed in Note H - Stock Repurchase Program. At August 25, 2007, 385,897 shares of common stock were reserved for future       issuance under this plan. Additionally, executives may participate in the       Amended and Restated Executive Stock Purchase Plan, which permits all eligible       executives to purchase AutoZones common stock up to 25 percent of his or her       annual salary and bonus. Purchases under this plan were 1,257 shares in fiscal       2007, 811 shares in fiscal 2006, and 5,366 shares in fiscal 2005. At August       25,       2007, 263,037 shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance under       this plan.
On       December 13, 2006, stockholders approved the AutoZone, Inc. 2006 Stock Option       Plan and the AutoZone, Inc. Fourth Amended and Restated Executive Stock Purchase       Plan. There have been no other material modifications to the Companys stock       plans during fiscal 2007, 2006, or 2005.
Note       C - Accrued Expenses and Other Accrued       expenses consisted of the following: (in                 thousands) August                 25, 2007 August                 26, 2006 Medical                 and casualty insurance claims (current portion) $ 52,037 $ 49,844 Accrued                 compensation; related payroll taxes and benefits 101,467 101,089 Property                 and sales taxes 61,570 54,623 Accrued                 interest 22,241 25,377 Accrued                 sales and warranty returns 8,634 8,238 Capital                 lease obligations 16,015  Other 45,669 41,248 $ 307,633 $ 280,419 The       Company retains a significant portion of the insurance risks associated with       workers compensation, employee health, general, products liability, property       and automotive insurance. Beginning in fiscal 2004, a portion of these       self-insured losses is managed through a wholly owned insurance captive. The       Company maintains certain levels for stop-loss coverage for each self-insured       plan in order to limit its liability for large claims. The limits are per claim       and are $1.5 million for workers compensation, $500,000 for employee health,       and $1.0 million for general, products liability, property, and automotive.       Self-insurance costs are accrued based upon the aggregate of the liability       for       reported claims and an estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported.       Estimates are based on calculations that consider historical lag and claim       development factors.
44 The       Company or the vendors supplying its products provide its customers limited       warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime warranties.       In most cases, the Companys vendors are primarily responsible for warranty       claims. Warranty costs relating to merchandise sold under warranty not covered       by vendors are estimated and recorded as warranty obligations at the time of       sale based on each products historical return rate. These obligations, which       are often funded by vendor allowances, are recorded as a component of accrued       expenses. For vendor allowances that are in excess of the related estimated       warranty expense for the vendors products, the excess is reclassified to       inventory and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the related       inventory is sold. Changes in the Companys accrued sales and warranty returns       during the fiscal year were minimal.
Note       D - Income Taxes The       provision for income tax expense consisted of the following: Year                 Ended (in                 thousands) August                 25, 2007 August                 26, 2006 August                 27, 2005 Current: Federal $ 292,166 $ 272,916 $ 296,849 State 23,468 23,539 21,981 315,634 296,455 318,830 Deferred: Federal 22,878 30,065 (11,271 ) State 1,966 6,241 (5,357 ) 24,844 36,306 (16,628 ) $ 340,478 $ 332,761 $ 302,202 A       reconciliation of the provision for income taxes to the amount computed by       applying the federal statutory tax rate of 35% to income before income taxes       is       as follows: Year                 Ended (in                 thousands) August                 25, 2007 August                 26, 2006 August                 27, 2005 Federal                 tax at statutory U.S. income tax rate $ 327,653 $ 315,713 $ 305,627 State                 income taxes, net 16,532 19,357 10,806 Tax                 benefit on repatriation of foreign earnings - - (16,351 ) Other (3,707 ) (2,309 ) 2,120 $ 340,478 $ 332,761 $ 302,202 The       American Jobs Creation Act (the Act), signed into law in October 2004,       provided an opportunity to repatriate foreign earnings, reinvest them in the       United States, and claim an 85% dividend received deduction on the repatriated       earnings provided certain criteria were met. During fiscal 2005, the Company       determined that it met the criteria of the Act and began the process of       repatriating approximately $36.7 million from its Mexican subsidiaries. As       the       Company had previously provided deferred income taxes on these amounts, the       planned repatriation resulted in a $16.4 million reduction to income tax expense       for fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, the Company completed the originally       planned $36.7 million repatriation plus an additional $4.5 million in       accumulated earnings.
45 Significant       components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities were as       follows: (in                 thousands) August                 25, 2007 August                 26, 2006 Net                 deferred tax assets: Domestic                 net operating loss and credit carryforwards $ 18,573 $ 18,694 Foreign                 net operating loss and credit carryforwards 6,257 4,017 Insurance                 reserves 13,683 13,748 Pension - 9,167 Accrued                 benefits 20,750 14,927 Other 15,640 15,291 Total                 deferred tax assets 74,903 75,844 Less:                 Valuation allowances (8,154 ) (8,698 ) Net                 deferred tax assets 66,749 67,146 Deferred                 tax liabilities: Property                 and equipment 8,296 13,118 Inventory 103,233 68,449 Derivatives 2,068 3,643 Pension 2,369 - Prepaid                 expenses 10,192 9,821 Other 1,412 1,576 Deferred                 tax liabilities 127,570 96,607 Net                 deferred tax liabilities $ (60,821 ) $ (29,461 ) Deferred       taxes are not provided for earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as such earnings       are intended to be permanently reinvested in the business.
For       the       years ended August 25, 2007, and August 26, 2006, the Company had deferred       tax       assets of $9.1 million and $9.0 million from federal tax net operating losses       ("NOLs") of $25.9 million and $25.7 million, and deferred tax assets of $1.8       million and $2.7 million from state tax NOLs of $51.3 million and $65.1 million,       respectively. As of August 25, 2007 the Company had deferred tax assets of       $3.1       million from Non-U.S. NOLs of $7.9 million. The federal, state, and Non-U.S.       NOLs expire between fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2027. The Company maintains a $7.2       million valuation allowance against certain federal and state NOLs resulting       primarily from annual statutory usage limitations. For the years ending August       25, 2007, and August 26, 2006, the Company had deferred tax assets of $10.9       million for federal, state and Non-U.S. income tax credit carryforwards. Certain       tax credit carryforwards have no expiration date and others will expire in       fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2017. A valuation allowance of $1.0 million has       been       established by the Company for credits subject to such expiration       periods.
Note       E - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities AutoZone       has utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate       debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances. AutoZone reflects       the       current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments in its consolidated       balance sheets as a component of other assets. All of the Companys interest       rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. The Company had       an       outstanding interest rate swap with a fair value of $5.8 million at August       25,       2007 and $10.2 million at August 26, 2006, to effectively fix the interest       rate       on the $300.0 million term loan entered into during December 2004. At August       28,       2004, the Company had an outstanding five-year forward-starting interest rate       swap with a notional amount of $300 million. This swap had a fair value of       $4.6       million at August 28, 2004 and was settled during November 2004 with no debt       being issued. Consequently, $4.6 million was recognized in earnings during       fiscal 2005.
The       related gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income or loss. These deferred       gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest       expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are       recognized in expense. However, to the extent that the change in value of an       interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the       value       of the cash flows being hedged, that ineffective portion is immediately       recognized in income. The Companys hedge instruments have been determined to be       highly effective as of August 25, 2007.
46 The       following table summarizes the fiscal 2007 and 2006 activity in accumulated       other comprehensive loss as it relates to interest rate hedge       instruments: (in                 thousands) Before-Tax Amount Income Tax After-Tax Amount Accumulated                 net gains as of August 27, 2005 $ 10,618 $ (1,589 ) $ 9,029 Net                 gains on outstanding derivatives 5,904 (2,152 ) 3,752 Reclassification                 of net gains on derivatives into earnings (612 )  (612 ) Accumulated                 net gains as of August 26, 2006 15,910 (3,741 ) 12,169 Net                 losses on outstanding derivatives (4,440 ) 1,627 (2,813 ) Reclassification                 of net gains on derivatives into earnings (612 )  (612 ) Accumulated                 net gains as of August 25, 2007 $ 10,858 $ (2,114 ) $ 8,744 The       Company primarily executes derivative transactions of relatively short duration       with strong creditworthy counterparties. These counterparties expose the Company       to credit risk in the event of non-performance. The amount of such exposure       is       limited to the unpaid portion of amounts due to the Company pursuant to the       terms of the derivative financial instruments, if any. Although there are no       collateral requirements, if a downgrade in the credit rating of these       counterparties occurs, management believes that this exposure is mitigated       by       provisions in the derivative agreements which allow for the legal right of       offset of any amounts due to the Company from the counterparties with amounts       payable, if any, to the counterparties by the Company. Management considers       the       risk of counterparty default to be minimal.
As       of       August 25, 2007, the Company estimates $600,000 of gains currently included       in       accumulated other comprehensive income to be reclassed into earnings within       the       next 12 months.

These facilities expire in May 2010,       may       be increased to $1.3 billion at AutoZones election, may include up to $200       million in letters of credit, and may include up to $100 million in capital       leases. As the available balance is reduced by commercial paper borrowings       and       certain outstanding letters of credit, the Company had $680.2 million in       available capacity under these facilities at August 25, 2007. The rate of       interest payable under the credit facilities is a function of Bank of Americas       base rate or a Eurodollar rate (each as defined in the facility agreements),       or       a combination thereof.
The       $300.0 million bank term loan entered in December 2004 was amended in April       2006       to have similar terms and conditions as the $1.0 billion credit facilities,       but       with a December 2009 maturity, and was further amended in August 2007 to reduce       the interest rate on Euro-dollar loans. That credit agreement with a group       of       banks provides for a term loan, which consists of, at the Companys election,       base rate loans, Eurodollar loans or a combination thereof. The interest accrues       on base rate loans at a base rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime       rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%. Interest accrues on Eurodollar       loans at a defined Eurodollar rate plus the applicable percentage, which can       range from 30 basis points to 90 basis points, depending upon the Companys       senior unsecured (non-credit enhanced) long-term debt rating. Based on       AutoZones ratings at August 25, 2007, the applicable percentage on Eurodollar       loans is 35 basis points. The Company may select interest periods of one, two,       three or six months for Eurodollar loans, subject to availability. Interest       is       payable at the end of the selected interest period, but no less frequently       than       quarterly. AutoZone entered into an interest rate swap agreement on December       29,       2004, to effectively fix, based on current debt ratings, the interest rate       of       the term loan at 4.4%. AutoZone has the option to extend loans into subsequent       interest period(s) or convert them into loans of another interest rate type.       The       entire unpaid principal amount of the term loan will be due and payable in       full       on December 23, 2009, when the facility terminates. The Company may prepay       the       term loan in whole or in part at any time without penalty, subject to       reimbursement of the lenders breakage and redeployment costs in the case of       prepayment of Eurodollar borrowings.
47 During       April 2006, the $150.0 million Senior Notes maturing at that time were repaid       with an increase in commercial paper. On June8, 2006, the Company issued       $200.0million in 6.95% Senior Notes due 2016 under its existing shelf       registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on       August17, 2004. That shelf registration allowed the Company to sell up to       $300 million in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes, including       repaying, redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt, and for working capital,       capital expenditures, new store openings, stock repurchases and acquisitions.       The remainder of the shelf registration was cancelled in February, 2007.
The       Companys borrowings under its Senior Notes arrangements contain minimal       covenants, primarily restrictions on liens. Under its other borrowing       arrangements, covenants include limitations on total indebtedness, restrictions       on liens, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a provision where repayment       obligations may be accelerated if AutoZone experiences a change in control       (as       defined in the agreements). All of the repayment obligations under the Companys       borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled       payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs. As of       August 25, 2007, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and expects       to       remain in compliance with all covenants.
All       of       the Companys debt is unsecured. Scheduled maturities of long-term debt are as       follows: Fiscal                 Year Amount (in                 thousands) 2008 $ 435,618 2009  2010 300,000 2011 200,000 2012  Thereafter 1,000,000 $ 1,935,618 The       maturities for fiscal 2008 are classified as long-term in the fiscal 2007       consolidated balance sheet as the Company has the ability and intention to       refinance them on a long-term basis.
The       fair       value of the Companys debt was estimated at $1.928 billion as of August 25,       2007, and $1.825 billion as of August 26, 2006, based on the quoted market       prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates available to       the       Company for debt of the same remaining maturities. Such fair value is less       than       the carrying value of debt by $7.6 million at August 25, 2007, and $32.3 million       at August 26, 2006.
Note       G - Interest Expense Net       interest expense consisted of the following: Year                 Ended (in                 thousands) August                 25, 2007 August                 26, 2006 August                 27, 2005 Interest                 expense $ 123,311 $ 112,127 $ 104,684 Interest                 income (2,819 ) (2,253 ) (1,162 ) Capitalized                 interest (1,376 ) (1,985 ) (1,079 ) $ 119,116 $ 107,889 $ 102,443 48 Note       H - Stock Repurchase Program During       1998, the Company announced a program permitting the Company to repurchase       a       portion of its outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established       by       the Companys Board of Directors. The program was most recently amended in June       2007 to increase the repurchase authorization to $5.9 billion from $5.4 billion.       From January 1998 to August 25, 2007, the Company has repurchased a total of       99.3 million shares at an aggregate cost of $5.4 billion.
The       following table summarizes our share repurchase activity for the following       fiscal years: Year                 Ended (in                 thousands) August                 25, 2007 August                 26, 2006 August                 27, 2005 Amount $ 761,887 $ 578,066 $ 426,852 Shares 6,032 6,187 4,822 Note       I - Pension and Savings Plans Prior       to       January 1, 2003, substantially all full-time employees were covered by a defined       benefit pension plan. The benefits under the plan were based on years of service       and the employees highest consecutive five-year average compensation. On       January 1, 2003, the plan was frozen. Accordingly, pension plan participants       will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will       join the pension plan.
On       January 1, 2003, the Companys supplemental defined benefit pension plan for       certain highly compensated employees was also frozen. Accordingly, plan       participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new       participants will join the pension plan.
In       September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.158, "Employers' Accounting       for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of       FASB       Statements No.87, 88, 106, and 132(R)" (SFAS158). SFAS158       requires plan sponsors of defined benefit pension and other postretirement       benefit plans (collectively postretirement benefit plans) to: recognize the       funded status of their postretirement benefit plans in the statement of       financial position; recognize the gains or losses and prior service costs or       credits as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, that arise       during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit       cost pursuant to SFAS No.87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" (SFAS       87); measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the       date of the fiscal year-end statement of financial position; and provide       additional disclosures about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for       the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses,       prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation.
For       the       fiscal year ending August 25, 2007, we adopted the recognition and disclosure       provisions of SFAS158. The effect of adopting SFAS158 on the       Companys financial condition at August 25, 2007 has been included in the       accompanying consolidated financial statements as described below.       SFAS158's provisions regarding the change in the measurement date of       postretirement benefit plans will require the Company to change its measurement       date, beginning in fiscal year 2009, from May 31 to its fiscal year end       date.
SFAS158       requires the Company to recognize the funded status, which is the difference       between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations,       of       its postretirement benefit plans in the August 25, 2007 Consolidated Statement       of Financial Position, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other       comprehensive income (AOCI), net of tax. The adjustment to AOCI at adoption       represents the net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service       costs, both of which were previously netted against the plans' funded status       in       the Companys Consolidated Statements of Financial Position pursuant to the       provisions of SFAS 87. These amounts will be subsequently recognized as net       periodic pension expense pursuant to the Companys historical accounting policy       for amortizing such amounts.
49 The       effects of adopting the provisions of SFAS 158 on our Consolidated Statement       of       Financial Position at August 25, 2007 are presented in the following       table: Pension       Balances Recorded (in                   thousands) Prior                   to Adopting SFAS 158 Effective                   of Adopting SFAS 158 As                   Reported Other                   non-current assets $ 8,780 $ (2,796 ) $ 5,984 Current                   liabilities 2,991 - 2,991 Deferred                   income tax liability, net 2,255 (1,089 ) 1,166 Accumulated                   other comprehensive loss $ 746 $ 1,707 $ 2,453 The       investment strategy for pension plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix       of       domestic and international equity portfolios, together with other investments,       to earn a long-term investment return that meets the Companys pension plan       obligations. Active management and alternative investment strategies are       utilized within the plan in an effort to minimize risk, while realizing       investment returns in excess of market indices.
The       weighted average asset allocation for our pension plan assets was as follows       at       June 30: 2007 2006 Current Target Current Target Domestic                 equities 30.7 % 33.5 % 32.0 % 27.0 % International                 equities 27.8 23.0 24.5 30.9 Alternative                 investments 27.7 30.5 30.5 27.9 Real                 estate 11.2 11.0 11.0 12.2 Cash                 and cash equivalents 2.6 2.0 2.0 2.0 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The       measurement date for the Companys defined benefit pension plans is May 31 of       each fiscal year.

51 Year                   Ended August                   25, August                   26, August                   27, (in                   thousands) 2007 2006 2005 Components                   of net periodic benefit cost: Interest                   cost $ 9,593 $ 9,190 $ 8,290 Expected                   return on plan assets (10,343 ) (8,573 ) (8,107 ) Amortization                   of prior service cost (54 ) (627 ) (644 ) Recognized                   net actuarial losses 751 5,645 1,000 Net                   periodic benefit cost $ (53 ) $ 5,635 $ 539 The       actuarial assumptions were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Weighted                 average discount rate 6.25 % 6.25 % 5.25 % Expected                 long-term rate of return on assets 8.00 % 8.00 % 8.00 % As       the       plan benefits are frozen, increases in future compensation levels no longer       impact the calculation and there is no service cost. The discount rate is       determined as of the measurement date with the assistance of actuaries, who       calculate the yield on a portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds with cash       flows       that generally match our expected benefit payments in future years. The expected       long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on the historical relationships       between the investment classes and the capital markets, updated for current       conditions. Prior service cost is amortized over the estimated average remaining       service period of active plan participants as of the date the prior service       base       is established, and the unrecognized actuarial loss is amortized over the       estimated remaining service period of 7.81 years at August 25,       2007.
The       Company makes annual contributions in amounts at least equal to the minimum       funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.       The       Company contributed $13.4 million to the plans in fiscal 2007, $9.2 million       to       the plans in fiscal 2006, and no contributions to the plans in fiscal 2005.       Based on current projections, we expect to contribute approximately $3.0 million       to the plan in fiscal 2008; however, a change to the expected cash funding       may       be impacted by a change in interest rates or a change in the actual or expected       return on plan assets.
Based       on       current assumptions about future events, benefit payments are expected to be       paid as follows for each of the following plan years. Actual benefit payments       may vary significantly from the following estimates: Plan                 Year Ending December 31 Amount (in                 thousands) 2007 $ 3,506 2008 4,114 2009 4,742 2010 5,318 2011 5,847 2012                 - 2016 39,101 The       Company has a 401(k) plan that covers all domestic employees who meet the plans       participation requirements. The plan features include Company matching       contributions, immediate 100% vesting of Company contributions and a savings       option to 25% of qualified earnings. The Company makes matching contributions,       per pay period, up to a specified percentage of employees contributions as       approved by the Board of Directors. The Company made matching contributions       to       employee accounts in connection with the 401(k) plan of $9.5 million in fiscal       2007, $8.6 million in fiscal 2006, and $8.4 million in fiscal 2005.
Note       J - Leases The       Company leases some of its retail stores, distribution centers, facilities,       land       and equipment, including vehicles. Most of these leases are operating leases       and       include renewal options, at the Companys election, and some include options to       purchase and provisions for percentage rent based on sales. Rental expense       was       $152.5 million in fiscal 2007, $143.9 million in fiscal 2006, and $150.6 million       in fiscal 2005. Percentage rentals were insignificant.
52 The       Company has a fleet of vehicles used for delivery to our commercial customers       and travel for members of field management. The majority of these vehicles       are       held under capital lease. At August 25, 2007, the Company had capital lease       assets of $54.4 million, net of accumulated amortization of $11.2 million,       and       capital lease obligations of $55.1 million. The $16.0 million current portion       of       these obligations was recorded as a component of other current liabilities       and       the $39.1 million long-term portion was recorded as a component of other       long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
Based       on       clarifications from the Securities and Exchange Commission, during fiscal 2005,       the Company completed a detailed review of its accounting for rent expense       and       expected useful lives of leasehold improvements. The Company noted       inconsistencies in the periods used to amortize leasehold improvements and       the       periods used to straight-line rent expense. The Company revised its policy       to       record rent for all operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease       term, including any reasonably assured renewal periods and the period of time       prior to the lease term that the Company is in possession of the leased space       for the purpose of installing leasehold improvements. Differences between       recorded rent expense and cash payments are recorded as a liability in accrued       expenses and other long-term liabilities on the balance sheet. This deferred       rent approximated $42.6 million on August 25, 2007 and $31.1 million on August       26, 2006. Additionally, all leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser       of their useful life or the remainder of the lease term, including any       reasonably assured renewal periods, in effect when the leasehold improvements       are placed in service. During the quarter ended February 12, 2005, the Company       recorded an adjustment in the amount of $40.3 million pre-tax ($25.4 million       after-tax), which lowered fiscal 2005 diluted earnings per share by $0.32.       This       adjustment included the impact on prior years, to reflect additional       amortization of leasehold improvements and additional rent expense as if this       new policy had always been followed by the Company. The impact of the adjustment       on any prior year would have been immaterial.
Minimum       annual rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases and capital       leases were as follows at the end of fiscal 2007: (amounts                   in thousands) Operating Capital Fiscal                   Year Leases Leases 2008 $ 171,163 $ 16,015 2009 155,446 15,535 2010 136,524 13,393 2011 117,452 10,404 2012 97,532 7,163 Thereafter 634,135 - Total                   minimum payments required $ 1,312,252 62,510 Less:                   interest (7,422 ) Present                   value of minimum capital lease payments $ 55,088 In       connection with the Companys December 2001 sale of the TruckPro business, the       Company subleased some properties to the purchaser for an initial term of not       less than 20 years. The Companys remaining aggregate rental obligation at       August 25, 2007 of $25.3 million is included in the above table, but the       obligation is entirely offset by the sublease rental agreement.
Note       K - Commitments and Contingencies Construction       commitments, primarily for new stores, totaled approximately $23.8 million       at       August 25, 2007.
The       Company had $113.3 million in outstanding standby letters of credit and $11.3       million in surety bonds as of August 25, 2007, which all have expiration periods       of less than one year. A substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters       of credit (which are primarily renewed on an annual basis) and surety bonds       are       used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers compensation carriers.       There are no additional contingent liabilities associated with these instruments       as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance       sheet. The standby letters of credit and surety bonds arrangements have       automatic renewal clauses.
53 Note       L - Litigation AutoZone,       Inc. is a defendant in a lawsuit entitled "Coalition for a Level Playing Field,       L.L.C., et al., v. AutoZone, Inc. et al.," filed in the U.S. District Court       for       the Southern District of New York in October 2004. The case was filed by more       than 200 plaintiffs, which are principally automotive aftermarket warehouse       distributors and jobbers (collectively Plaintiffs), against a number of       defendants, including automotive aftermarket retailers and aftermarket       automotive parts manufacturers. In the amended complaint, the plaintiffs allege,       inter alia, that some or all of the automotive aftermarket retailer defendants       have knowingly received, in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act (the Act),       from various of the manufacturer defendants benefits such as volume discounts,       rebates, early buy allowances and other allowances, fees, inventory without       payment, sham advertising and promotional payments, a share in the       manufacturers' profits, benefits of pay on scan purchases, implementation of       radio frequency identification technology, and excessive payments for services       purportedly performed for the manufacturers. Additionally, a subset of       plaintiffs alleges a claim of fraud against the automotive aftermarket retailer       defendants based on discovery issues in a prior litigation involving similar       Robinson-Patman Act claims. In the prior litigation, the discovery dispute,       as       well as the underlying claims, were decided in favor of AutoZone and the other       automotive aftermarket retailer defendants who proceeded to trial, pursuant       to a       unanimous jury verdict which was affirmed by the Second Circuit Court of       Appeals. In the current litigation, plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of       damages (including statutory trebling), attorneys' fees, and a permanent       injunction prohibiting the aftermarket retailer defendants from inducing and/or       knowingly receiving discriminatory prices from any of the aftermarket       manufacturer defendants and from opening up any further stores to compete with       plaintiffs as long as defendants allegedly continue to violate the Act. The       Company believes this suit to be without merit and is vigorously defending       against it. Defendants have filed motions to dismiss all claims with prejudice       on substantive and procedural grounds. Additionally, the Defendants have sought       to enjoin plaintiffs from filing similar lawsuits in the future. If granted       in       their entirety, these dispositive motions would resolve the litigation in       Defendants' favor.
On       June       22, 2005, the Attorney General of the State of California, in conjunction with       District Attorneys for San Bernardino, San Joaquin and Monterey Counties, filed       suit in the San Bernardino County Superior Court against AutoZone, Inc. and       its       California subsidiaries. The San Diego County District Attorney later joined       the       suit. The lawsuit alleges that AutoZone failed to follow various state statutes       and regulation governing the storage and handling of used motor oil and other       materials collected for recycling or used for cleaning AutoZone stores and       parking lots. The suit sought $12 million in penalties and injunctive relief.       On       June 1, 2007, AutoZone and the State entered into a Stipulated Final Judgment       by       Consent. The Stipulated Final Judgment amended the suit to also allege weights       and measures (pricing) violations. Pursuant to this Judgment, AutoZone is       enjoined from committing these types of violations and agreed to pay civil       penalties in the amount of $1.8 million, including $1.5 million in cash and       a       $300,000 credit for work performed to insure compliance.
The       Company currently, and from time to time, is involved in various other legal       proceedings incidental to the conduct of its business. Although the amount       of       liability that may result from these other proceedings cannot be ascertained,       the Company does not currently believe that, in the aggregate, these matters       will result in liabilities material to the Companys financial condition,       results of operations or cash flows.
