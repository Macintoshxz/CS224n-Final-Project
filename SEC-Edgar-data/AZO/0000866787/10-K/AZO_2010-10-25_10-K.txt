PART       I Item       1. Business Introduction We       are       the nations leading specialty retailer of automotive parts and accessories,       with most of our sales to do-it-yourself (DIY) customers. We began operations       in 1979 and at August 26, 2006 operated 3,771 stores in the United States,       and       100 in Mexico. Each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars,       sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured       automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive       products. In many of our stores we also have a commercial sales program that       provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products       to       local, regional and national repair garages, dealers and service stations.       We       also sell the ALLDATA brand automotive diagnostic and repair software. On the       web at www.autozone.com, we sell diagnostic and repair information, auto and       light truck parts, and accessories. We do not derive revenue from automotive       repair or installation.
At       August       26, 2006, our stores were in the following locations: Alabama 88 Arizona 105 Arkansas 55 California 418 Colorado 54 Connecticut 29 Delaware 9 Florida 170 Georgia 149 Idaho 18 Illinois 180 Indiana 120 Iowa 22 Kansas 37 Kentucky 71 Louisiana 86 Maine 6 Maryland 37 Massachusetts 66 Michigan 132 Minnesota 21 Mississippi 76 Missouri 88 Montana 1 Nebraska 13 Nevada 40 New                 Hampshire 15 New                 Jersey 50 New                 Mexico 52 New                 York 111 North                 Carolina 136 North                 Dakota 2 Ohio 203 Oklahoma 66 Oregon 25 Pennsylvania 98 Puerto                 Rico 12 Rhode                 Island 15 South                 Carolina 66 South                 Dakota 1 Tennessee 138 Texas 457 Utah 34 Vermont 1 Virginia 78 Washington 39 Washington,                 DC 6 West                 Virginia 22 Wisconsin 48 Wyoming 5 Domestic                 Total 3,771 Mexico 100 TOTAL 3,871 5 Marketing       and Merchandising Strategy We       are       dedicated to providing customers with superior service, value and quality       automotive parts and products at conveniently located, well-designed stores.       Key       elements of this strategy are: Customer       Service Customer       service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising       strategy, which is based upon consumer marketing research. We emphasize that       our       AutoZoners (employees) should always put customers first by providing prompt,       courteous service and trustworthy advice. Our electronic parts catalog assists       in the selection of parts; and lifetime warranties are offered by us or our       vendors on many of the parts we sell. Our wide area network in our stores helps       us to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes, to locate       parts at neighboring AutoZone stores and in some cases to place orders directly       with our vendors.
Our       stores generally open at 7:30 or 8 a.m. and close between 8 and 10 p.m. Monday       through Saturday and typically open at 9 a.m. and close between 6 and 9 p.m.       on       Sunday. However, some stores are open 24 hours, and some have extended hours       of       6 or 7 a.m. until midnight seven days a week.
We       also       provide specialty tools through our Loan-A-Tool program. Customers can borrow a       specialty tool, such as a steering wheel puller, for which a DIY customer or       a       repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job. AutoZoners       also provide other free services, including check engine light readings; battery       charging; oil recycling; and testing of starters, alternators, batteries,       sensors and actuators.
Merchandising The       following table shows some of the types of products that we sell: Hard                 Parts Maintenance                 Items Accessories                 and Non-Automotive A/C                 Compressors Antifreeze                 & Windshield Washer Air                 Fresheners Alternators Belts                 & Hoses Cell                 Phone Accessories Batteries &               Accessories Chemicals,               including               Brake & Power Drinks &               Snacks Brake                 Drums, Rotors, Steering                 Fluid, Oil & Fuel Additives Floor                 Mats Shoes                 & Pads Fuses Hand                 Cleaner Carburetors Lighting Neon Clutches Oil                 & Transmission Fluid Mirrors CV                 Axles Oil,                 Air, Fuel & Transmission Filters Paint                 & Accessories Engines Oxygen                 Sensors Performance                 Products Fuel                 Pumps Protectants                 & Cleaners Seat                 Covers Mufflers Refrigerant                 & Accessories Steering                 Wheel Covers Shock                 Absorbers & Struts Sealants                 & Adhesives Stereos Starters Spark                 Plugs & Wires Tools Water                 Pumps Wash                 & Wax Windshield                 Wipers 6 We       believe that the satisfaction of DIY customers and professional technicians       is       often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as       requested. Our stores generally offer approximately 21,000 stock keeping units       (SKUs), covering a broad range of vehicle types. Each store carries the same       basic product lines, but we tailor our parts inventory to the makes and models       of the vehicles in each stores trade area. Our hub stores carry a larger       assortment of products that can be delivered to commercial customers or local       satellite stores. In excess of 750,000 additional SKUs of slower-selling       products are available either through our vendor direct program (VDP), which       offers overnight delivery, or through our salvage auto parts and original       equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts programs.
We       are       constantly updating the products that we offer to assure that our inventory       matches the products that our customers demand.
Pricing We       want       to be perceived by our customers as the value leader in our industry by       consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price, backed by a       good       warranty and outstanding customer service. On many of our products we offer       multiple value choices in a good/better/best assortment, with appropriate price       and quality differences from the good products to the better and best products. A key component is our exclusive line of in-house brands: Valucraft,       AutoZone, Duralast and Duralast Gold. We believe that our overall prices and       value compare favorably to those of our competitors.
Marketing:       Advertising and Promotions We       believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in       succeeding in todays environment. We are constantly working to understand our       customers wants and needs so that we can build long-lasting, loyal       relationships. We utilize promotions and advertising primarily to advise       customers about the overall importance of vehicle maintenance, our great value       and the availability of high quality parts. Broadcast and targeted loyalty       efforts are our primary marketing methods of driving traffic to our stores.       We       utilize in-store signage and creative product placement to help educate       customers about products they need.
Store       Design and Visual Merchandising We       design       and build stores for a high visual impact. The typical AutoZone store has an       industrial high tech appearance by utilizing colorful exterior and interior       signage, exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lighted interiors. Maintenance       products, accessories and miscellaneous items are attractively displayed for       easy browsing by customers. In-store signage and special displays promote       products on floor displays, end caps and on the shelf.
Commercial Our       commercial sales program is one of the largest aftermarket sellers of automotive       parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers       and service stations in the United States. As a part of the program we offer       credit and delivery to our commercial customers. The program operated out of       2,134 stores as of August 26, 2006. Through our hub stores, we offer a greater       range of parts and products desired by professional technicians, and this       additional inventory is available for our DIY customers as well. Commercial       has       a national sales team focused on national and regional commercial accounts,       as       well as an outside sales force for customers located around our commercial       stores.
Store       Operations Store       Formats Substantially       all AutoZone stores are based on standard store formats, resulting in generally       consistent appearance, merchandising and product mix. Approximately 85% to       90%       of each stores square footage is selling space, of which approximately 40% to       45% is dedicated to hard parts inventory. The hard parts inventory area is       generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store,       dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store. The remaining       selling space contains displays of maintenance, accessories and non-automotive       items.
7 We       have       knowledgeable AutoZoners available to assist customers with their parts needs,       utilizing our proprietary electronic parts catalog with a display screen that       is       visible to both the AutoZoner and the customer. In addition to helping ensure       fast, accurate parts look-up in both English and Spanish, the parts catalog       will       also suggest additional items that a customer should purchase to properly       install the merchandise being purchased.
We       believe that our stores are destination stores, generating their own traffic       rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores. Therefore, we situate       most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking.
Store       Personnel and Training Each       store typically employs from 10 to 16 AutoZoners, including a manager and,       in       some cases, an assistant manager. AutoZoners typically have prior automotive       experience. All AutoZoners are encouraged to complete courses resulting in       certification by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence       (ASE), which is broadly recognized for training certification in the       automotive industry. Although we do on-the-job training, we also provide formal       training programs, including an annual national sales meeting, regular store       meetings on specific sales and product issues, standardized training manuals       and       a specialist program that trains AutoZoners in several areas of technical       expertise from both the Company and from independent certification agencies.       Training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management.
Store       managers receive financial incentives through performance-based bonuses. In       addition, our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified       AutoZoners. We believe these opportunities are important to attract, motivate       and retain quality AutoZoners.
All       store       support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in       Memphis, Tennessee and Mexico. We believe that this centralization enhances       consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store       level, while reducing expenses and cost of sales.
Store       Automation All       of       our stores have a proprietary electronic parts catalog that provides parts       information based on the make, model and year of a vehicle. The electronic       catalog also tracks inventory availability at the store, at other nearby stores       and through special order. The catalog display screens are placed on the hard       parts counter or pods, where both AutoZoners and customers can view the screen.       In addition, our wide area network enables the stores to expedite credit or       debit card and check approval processes, to access immediately national warranty       data, to implement real-time inventory controls and to locate and hold parts       at       neighboring AutoZone stores.
Our       stores utilize our computerized proprietary Store Management System, which       includes bar code scanning and point-of-sale data collection terminals. The       Store Management System provides administrative assistance and improved       personnel scheduling at the store level, as well as enhanced merchandising       information and improved inventory control. We believe the Store Management       System also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions       and simplified warranty and product return procedures.
8 Store       Development The       following table reflects store development during the past five fiscal       years: Fiscal                 Year 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Beginning                 Domestic Stores 3,592 3,420 3,219 3,068 3,019 New                 Stores 185 175 202 160 102 Replaced                 Stores 18 7 4 6 15 Closed                 Stores 6 3 1 9 53 Net                 New Stores 179 172 201 151 49 Ending                 Domestic Stores 3,771 3,592 3,420 3,219 3,068 Ending                 Mexico Stores 100 81 63 49 39 Ending                 Total Stores 3,871 3,673 3,483 3,268 3,107 The       fiscal 2006 closed store count reflects 4 stores that remain closed temporarily       from hurricane damage. We believe that expansion opportunities exist both in       markets that we do not currently serve, as well as in markets where we can       achieve a larger presence. We attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high       traffic locations and undertake substantial research prior to entering new       markets. The most important criteria for opening a new store are its projected       future profitability and its ability to achieve our required investment hurdle       rate. Key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population,       demographics, vehicle profile, number and strength of competitors stores and       the cost of real estate. In reviewing the vehicle profile, we also consider       the       number of vehicles that are seven years old and older- our kind of vehicles, as these are generally no longer under the original manufacturers warranties       and will require more maintenance and repair than younger vehicles. We generally       seek to open new stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and       attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time.       In addition to continuing to lease or develop our own stores, we evaluate and       may make strategic acquisitions.
Purchasing       and Supply Chain Merchandise       is selected and purchased for all stores through our two store support centers       located in Memphis, Tennessee and Mexico. No one class of product accounts       for       as much as 10 percent of our total sales. In fiscal 2006, no single supplier       accounted for more than 10 percent of our total purchases. We generally have       few       long-term contracts for the purchase of merchandise. We believe that we have       good relationships with suppliers. We also believe that alternative sources       of       supply exist, at similar cost, for most types of product sold. Most of our       merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet       of       tractors and trailers or by third-party trucking firms.
Our       hub       stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis       to       many of our stores. A hub store is able to provide replenishment of products       sold and deliver other products maintained only in hub store inventories to       a       store in its coverage area generally within 24 hours. Hub stores are generally       replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week.
Competition The       sale       of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive       in       many areas, including name recognition, product availability, customer service,       store location and price. AutoZone competes in both the retail DIY and       commercial do it for me (DIFM) auto parts and accessories       markets.
Competitors       include national and regional auto parts chains, independently owned parts       stores, wholesalers and jobbers, repair shops, car washes and auto dealers,       in       addition to discount and mass merchandise stores, department stores, hardware       stores, supermarkets, drugstores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle       parts and supplies, chemicals, accessories, tools and maintenance parts.       AutoZone competes on the basis of customer service, including the trustworthy       advice of our AutoZoners, merchandise selection and availability, price, product       warranty, store layouts and location.
9 Trademarks       and Patents We       have       registered several service marks and trademarks in the United States Patent       and       Trademark office as well as in certain other countries, including our service       marks, AutoZone and Get in the Zone, and trademarks, AutoZone, Duralast, Duralast Gold, Valucraft and ALLDATA. We believe that the AutoZone service marks and trademarks are important components of our merchandising       and       marketing strategy.
Employees As       of       August 26, 2006, we employed approximately 53,000 persons, approximately 57       percent of whom were employed full-time. About 91 percent of our AutoZoners       were       employed in stores or in direct field supervision, approximately 6 percent       in       distribution centers and approximately 3 percent in store support functions.       Included in the above numbers are approximately 1,600 persons employed in our       Mexico operations.
We       have       never experienced any material labor disruption and believe that relations       with       our AutoZoners are generally good.

Item       1A. Risk Factors Our       business is subject to a variety of risks. Set forth below are certain of the       important risks that we face and that could cause actual results to differ       materially from historical results. These risks are not the only ones we face.       Our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently       unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our       business.
We       may not be able to increase sales by the same historic growth       rates.
We       have       increased our store count in the past five fiscal years, growing from 3,040       stores at August 25, 2001, to 3,871 stores at August 26, 2006, an average store       count increase per year of 5%. Additionally, we have increased annual revenues       in the past five fiscal years from $4.818 billion in fiscal 2001 to $5.948       billion in fiscal 2006, an average increase per year of 5%. Annual revenue       growth is driven by the opening of new stores and same-store sales. We cannot       provide any assurance that we can continue to open stores or increase same-store       sales.
11 Our       business depends upon qualified employees.
At       the       end of fiscal 2006, our consolidated employee count was approximately 53,000.       We       cannot assure that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at       current wage rates. If we do not maintain competitive wages, our customer       service could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce or,       alternatively, our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage       rates.
If       demand for our products slows, then our business may be materially       affected.
Demand       for products sold by our stores depends on many factors. In the short term,       it       may depend upon:  the                 number of miles vehicles are driven annually, as higher vehicle mileage                 increases the need for maintenance and repair. Mileage levels may                 be                 affected by gas prices and other                 factors.
the                 number of vehicles in current service that are seven years old and                 older,                 as these vehicles are no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers                 warranties and will need more maintenance and repair than younger                 vehicles.
the                 weather, as vehicle maintenance may be deferred.
the                 economy. In periods of rapidly declining economic conditions, both                 retail                 DIY and commercial DIFM customers may defer vehicle maintenance or                 repair.                 During periods of expansionary economic conditions, more of our DIY                 customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead                 of                 working on their own vehicles or they may purchase new vehicles.
For       the       long term, demand for our products may depend upon:  the                 quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers                 and the length of the warranty or maintenance offered on new                 vehicles.
restrictions                 on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the                 original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental                 regulation.
If       we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell       the products       that we sell, we could lose customers and our sales and profits       may decline.
The       sale       of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive       based on many factors, including name recognition, product availability,       customer service, store location and price. Competitors are rapidly opening       locations near our existing stores. AutoZone competes as a supplier in both       the       DIY and DIFM auto parts and accessories markets.
Competitors       include national, regional and local auto parts chains, independently owned       parts stores, jobbers, repair shops, car washes and auto dealers, in addition       to       discount and mass merchandise stores, department stores, hardware stores,       supermarkets, drugstores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts       and       supplies, chemicals, accessories, tools and maintenance parts. Although we       believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service, including       the       knowledge and expertise of our AutoZoners, merchandise quality, selection and       availability, product warranty, store layout, location and convenience, price,       and the strength of our AutoZone brand name, trademarks and service marks;       some       competitors may have competitive advantages, such as greater financial and       marketing resources, larger stores with more merchandise, longer operating       histories, more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising. If       we       are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies, or if       our       competitors develop more effective strategies, we could lose customers and       our       sales and profits may decline.
12 If       we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto       parts business,       our sales growth may be limited.
Although       we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market, to       increase commercial sales we must compete against national and regional auto       parts chains, independently owned parts stores, wholesalers and jobbers, repair       shops and auto dealers. Although we believe we compete effectively on the basis       of customer service, merchandise quality, selection and availability, price,       product warranty and distribution locations, and the strength of our AutoZone       brand name, trademarks and service marks, some automotive aftermarket jobbers       have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have,       have developed long-term customer relationships and have large available       inventories. We can make no assurances that we can profitably develop new       commercial customers or make available inventories required by commercial       customers.
If       our vendors continue to consolidate, we may pay higher prices for       our merchandise.
In       recent       years, several of our vendors have merged and others have announced plans to       merge. Further vendor consolidation could limit the number of vendors from       which       we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for       these       products.
Consolidation       among our competitors may negatively impact our business.
In       recent       years, several large auto parts chains have merged. We do not know the impact       these mergers will have upon competition in the automotive aftermarket. If       our       competitors are able to achieve efficiencies in their mergers, then there may       be       greater competitive pressures in the markets in which they are       stronger.
War       or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may negatively       impact availability       of merchandise and adversely impact our sales.
War       or       acts of terrorism, or the threat of either, may have a negative impact on our       ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores. Some of our       merchandise is imported from other countries. If imported goods become difficult       or impossible to bring into the United States, and if we cannot obtain such       merchandise from other sources at similar costs, our sales and profit margins       may be negatively affected.
In       the       event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed,       our       business may be adversely impacted, as we may have difficulty shipping       merchandise to our distribution centers and stores.
Rising       energy prices may negatively impact our profitability.
As       mentioned above, rising energy prices may impact demand for the products that       we       sell, overall transaction count and our profitability. Energy prices impact       our       merchandise distribution, commercial delivery, utility, and product costs.
Demand       for our merchandise may decline if vehicle manufacturers refuse to make       available the information our customers need to work on their own       vehicles.
Demand       for our merchandise may decline if vehicle manufacturers refuse to make       available to the automotive aftermarket industry diagnostic, repair and       maintenance information our customers, both retail (DIY) and commercial (DIFM),       require to diagnose, repair and maintain their vehicles. Without public       dissemination of this information, consumers may be forced to have all       diagnostic work, repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers'       dealer network.

Properties The       following table reflects the square footage and number of leased and owned       properties for our stores as of August 26, 2006: No.                 of Stores Square                 Footage Leased 1,764 10,440,562 Owned 2,107 14,272,799 Total 3,871 24,713,361 We       have       over 3.3 million square feet in distribution centers servicing our stores,       most       of which is owned, except for approximately 1.2 million square feet that is       leased. Our distribution centers are located in Arizona, California, Georgia,       Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas and Mexico. We opened a new distribution center       near Dallas, Texas in fiscal 2005 and closed our smaller facilities in San       Antonio, Texas in fiscal 2005 and Lafayette, Louisiana in fiscal 2006. Our       primary store support center, which we own, is located in Memphis, Tennessee,       and consists of approximately 260,000 square feet. We also own and lease other       properties that are not material in the aggregate.
Item       3. Legal Proceedings AutoZone,       Inc. is a defendant in a lawsuit entitled "Coalition for a Level Playing Field,       L.L.C., et al., v. AutoZone, Inc. et al.," filed in the U.S. District Court       for       the Southern District of New York in October 2004. The case was filed by more       than 200 plaintiffs, which are principally automotive aftermarket warehouse       distributors and jobbers (collectively Plaintiffs), against a number of       defendants, including automotive aftermarket retailers and aftermarket       automotive parts manufacturers. In the amended complaint, the plaintiffs allege,       inter alia, that some or all of the automotive aftermarket retailer defendants       have knowingly received, in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act (the Act),       from various of the manufacturer defendants benefits such as volume discounts,       rebates, early buy allowances and other allowances, fees, inventory without       payment, sham advertising and promotional payments, a share in the       manufacturers' profits, benefits of pay on scan purchases, implementation of       radio frequency identification technology, and excessive payments for services       purportedly performed for the manufacturers. Additionally, a subset of       plaintiffs alleges a claim of fraud against the automotive aftermarket retailer       defendants based on discovery issues in a prior litigation involving similar       Robinson-Patman Act claims. In the prior litigation, the discovery dispute,       as       well as the underlying claims, were decided in favor of AutoZone and the other       automotive aftermarket retailer defendants who proceeded to trial, pursuant       to a       unanimous jury verdict which was affirmed by the Second Circuit Court of       Appeals. In the current litigation, plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of       damages (including statutory trebling), attorneys' fees, and a permanent       injunction prohibiting the aftermarket retailer defendants from inducing and/or       knowingly receiving discriminatory prices from any of the aftermarket       manufacturer defendants and from opening up any further stores to compete with       plaintiffs as long as defendants allegedly continue to violate the Act. The       Company believes this suit to be without merit and is vigorously defending       against it. Defendants have filed motions to dismiss all claims with prejudice       on substantive and procedural grounds. Additionally, the Defendants have sought       to enjoin plaintiffs from filing similar lawsuits in the future. If granted       in       their entirety, these dispositive motions would resolve the litigation in       Defendants' favor.
On       June       22, 2005, the Attorney General of the State of California, in conjunction with       District Attorneys for San Bernardino, San Joaquin and Monterey Counties, filed       suit in the San Bernardino County Superior Court against AutoZone, Inc. and       its       California subsidiaries. The San Diego County District Attorney later joined       the       suit. The lawsuit alleges that AutoZone failed to follow various state statutes       and regulations governing the storage and handling of used motor oil and other       materials collected for recycling or used for cleaning AutoZone stores and       parking lots. The suit seeks $12.0 million in penalties and injunctive relief.
AutoZone       is involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of       our       business. Although the amount of liability that may result from these other       proceedings cannot be ascertained, we do not currently believe that, in the       aggregate, they will result in liabilities material to our financial condition,       results of operations, or cash flows.
Item       4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders Not       applicable.
14 PART       II Item       5. Market for Registrants Common Equity and Related Stockholder       Matters AutoZones       common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AZO. On       October 17, 2006, there were 3,589 stockholders of record, which does not       include the number of beneficial owners whose shares were represented by       security position listings.
We       currently do not pay a cash dividend on our common stock. Any payment of       dividends in the future would be dependent upon our financial condition, capital       requirements, earnings, cash flow and other factors.
