The assets and liabilities of the divested trading and merchandising operations are classified as assets and liabilities held for sale within the Companys consolidated balance sheets for all periods.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company completed its divestiture of the Knotts Berry Farm  (Knotts) jams and jellies brand and operations for proceeds of approximately $55 million, resulting in no significant gain or loss. The Company reflects the results of these operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of the divested Knotts business have been reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale within the Companys consolidated balance sheets for all periods prior to divestiture.

The forecasted cost of the two plans, updated through May25, 2008, is $276 million. The Company has incurred total charges of $259 million in implementing these plans since the inception of the fiscal 2006-2008 restructuring plan. The categories of events leading to costs have included reducing headcount, closing facilities, and writing-down assets.

General The following comments pertain to each of the Companys reporting segments.
ConAgra Foods is a food company that operates principally in many sectors of the food industry, with a significant focus on the sale of branded and value-added consumer products. ConAgra Foods uses many different raw materials, the bulk of which are commodities. The prices paid for raw materials used in the products of ConAgra Foods generally reflect factors such as weather, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, tariffs, and the effects of governmental agricultural programs. Although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors, the Company believes such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources. The Company has faced increased costs for many of its significant raw materials, packaging, and energy inputs. The Company seeks to mitigate the higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives, and through the use of derivative instruments used to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption. The Company expects to take further price increases during fiscal 2009.
5 Table of Contents The Company experiences intense competition for sales of its principal products in its major markets. The Companys products compete with widely advertised, well-known, branded products, as well as private label and customized products. Some of the Companys competitors are larger and have greater resources than the Company. The Company has major competitors in each of its reporting segments. The Company competes primarily on the bases of quality, value, customer service, brand recognition, and brand loyalty.
Quality control processes at principal manufacturing locations emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control. In addition, the Company conducts research activities related to the development of new products. Research and development expense was $69 million, $68 million, and $54 million in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.
Demand for certain of the Companys products may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events.
The Company manufactures primarily for stock and fills customer orders from finished goods inventories. While at any given time there may be some backlog of orders, such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales, and the changes from time to time are not significant.
The Companys trademarks are of material importance to its business and are protected by registration or other means in the United States and most other markets where the related products are sold. Some of the Companys products are sold under brands that have been licensed from others. The Company also actively develops and maintains a portfolio of patents, although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole. The Company has proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes, and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.
Many of ConAgra Foods facilities and products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the quality of products, sanitation, safety, and environmental control. The Company believes that it complies with such laws and regulations in all material respects, and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings, or the competitive position of the Company.
The Companys largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores,Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 15%, 15%, and 13% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, primarily in the Consumer Foods segment.
At May25, 2008, ConAgra Foods and its subsidiaries had approximately 25,000 employees, primarily in the United States. Approximately 52% of the Companys employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements, of which, approximately 34% are parties to collective bargaining agreements that are scheduled to expire during fiscal 2009.

e) Available Information The Company makes available, free of charge through the Investors link on its Internet web site at http://www.conagrafoods.com, its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

ITEM1A.
RISK FACTORS The following factors could affect the Companys operating results and should be considered in evaluating the Company.
Continuing increases in commodity costs may have a negative impact on profits.
The Company uses many different commodities such as wheat, corn, oats, soybeans, beef, pork, poultry, and energy. Commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, and changes in governmental agricultural programs. Commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material costs and operating costs. The Company may not be able to increase its product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs; and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume and profitability. The Company has experience in hedging against commodity price increases; however, these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases.
Increased competition may result in reduced sales or margin for the Company.
The food industry is highly competitive, and increased competition can reduce sales for the Company due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures. Competitive pressures also may restrict the Companys ability to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other cost increases. The Companys profit margins could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume.
The sophistication and buying power of the Companys customers could have a negative impact on profits.
Many of the Companys customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and food distributors, have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue. These consolidations and the growth of supercenters have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases and operating with reduced inventories. These customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space, currently used for Company products, for their private label products. The Company is implementing initiatives to counteract these pressures. However, if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength and/or increased private label competition, the Companys profitability could decline.
The Company must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences.
Consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of the Companys food products depends on the Companys ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences. Introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment. If the Companys products fail to meet consumer preference, then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and the Companys strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in marketing and innovation will be less successful.
7 Table of Contents If the Company does not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry, its profitability could decrease.
The Companys success depends in part on its ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and be efficient in the highly competitive food industry, particularly in light of rising input costs. The Company is currently implementing profit-enhancing initiatives that impact its supply chain and general and administrative functions. These initiatives are focused on cost savings opportunities in procurement, manufacturing, logistics, and customer service, as well as general and administrative overhead levels. If the Company does not continue to manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies, its competitiveness and its profitability could decrease.
The Company may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls, which could negatively impact its profitability.
The Company sells food products for human consumption, which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage, product tampering, and other adulteration of food products. The Company may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of its products causes injury, illness, or death. In addition, the Company will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage. In the past, the Company has issued recalls and has from time to time been and currently is involved in lawsuits relating to its food products. A significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact the Companys sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability, competitive reaction, and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that Company products caused illness or injury could adversely affect the Companys reputation with existing and potential customers and its corporate and brand image.
If the Company fails to comply with the many laws applicable to its business, it may incur significant fines and penalties.
The Companys facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, quality, and safety of food products. The Companys failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject it to administrative penalties and injunctive relief, civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of its products. The Companys operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes. Failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity.
The Companys information technology resources must provide efficient connections between its business functions, or its results of operations will be negatively impacted.
Each year the Company engages in several billion dollars of transactions with its customers and vendors. Because the amount of dollars involved is so significant, the Companys information technology resources must provide connections among its marketing, sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service, and accounting functions. If the Company does not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain the related computerized and manual control processes, it could be subject to billing and collection errors, business disruptions, or damage resulting from security breaches. The Company is currently implementing new financial and operational information technology systems. Some systems were placed into production during fiscal 2008. Additional changes and enhancements will be placed into production at various times in fiscal 2009 and 2010. If future implementation problems are encountered, the Companys results of operations could be negatively impacted.

ITEM3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In fiscal 1991, the Company acquired Beatrice Company (Beatrice). As a result of the acquisition and the significant pre-acquisition contingencies of the Beatrice businesses and its former subsidiaries, the consolidated post-acquisition financial statements of the Company reflect liabilities associated with the estimated resolution of these contingencies. These include various litigation and environmental proceedings related to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to its acquisition by the Company. The litigation includes several public nuisance and personal injury suits against a number of lead paint and pigment manufacturers, including ConAgra Grocery Products and the Company as alleged successors to W. P. Fuller Co., a lead paint and pigment manufacturer owned and operated by Beatrice until 1967.Although decisions favorable to the Company have been rendered in Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Wisconsin, the Company remains a defendant in active suits in Illinois, Ohio, and California. The Illinois suit seeks class-wide relief in the form of medical monitoring for elevated levels of lead in blood. The State of Ohio and several of its municipalities seek abatement of the alleged nuisance and unspecified damages. In California, a number of cities and counties have joined in a consolidated action seeking abatement of the alleged public nuisance.
The environmental proceedings include litigation and administrative proceedings involving Beatrices status as a potentially responsible party at 36 Superfund, proposed Superfund, or state-equivalent sites; these sites involve locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of Beatrice that used or produced petroleum, pesticides, fertilizers, dyes, inks, solvents, PCBs, acids, lead, sulfur, tannery wastes, and/or other contaminants. Beatrice has paid or is in the process of paying its liability share at 34 of these sites. Reserves for these matters have been established based on the Companys best estimate of its undiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required cleanup, the known volumetric contribution of Beatrice and other potentially responsible parties, and its experience in remediating sites. The reserves for Beatrice environmental matters totaled $93.6 million as of May25, 2008, a majority of which relates to the Superfund and state equivalent sites referenced above. Expenditures for these matters are expected to continue for a period of up to 20 years.
The Company is party to a number of lawsuits and claims arising out of the operation of its business, including lawsuits and claims related to the February 2007 recall of its peanut butter products. The Company believes that the ultimate resolution of these lawsuits and claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. On June28, 2007, officials from the Food and Drug Administrations Office of Criminal Investigations executed a search warrant at the Companys peanut butter manufacturing facility in Sylvester, Georgia, which had been closed since the initiation of the recall, to obtain a variety of records and information relating to plant operations. The Company is cooperating with officials in regard to the investigation.
After taking into account liabilities recorded for all of the foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide a summary of significant factors relevant to the Companys financial performance and condition. The discussion should be read together with the Companys financial statements and related notes in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Results for the fiscal year ended May25, 2008 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be attained in the future.
Executive Overview ConAgra Foods, Inc. (NYSE: CAG) is one of North Americas leading packaged food companies, serving grocery retailers, as well as restaurants and other foodservice establishments. Popular ConAgra Foods consumer brands include: Banquet  , Chef Boyardee  , Egg Beaters  , Healthy Choice  , Hebrew National  , Hunts  , Marie Callenders  , Orville Redenbachers  , Reddi-wip  , PAM  , and many others.
Fiscal 2008 diluted earnings per share were $1.90, including $1.06 per diluted share of income from continuing operations and income of $0.84 per diluted share from discontinued operations. Fiscal 2007 diluted earnings per share were $1.51, including income from continuing operations of $0.95 per diluted share and income from discontinued operations of $0.56 per diluted share. Several items affect the comparability of results of continuing operations, as discussed in Other Significant Items of NoteItems Impacting Comparability, below.
Operating Initiatives ConAgra Foods is implementing operational improvement initiatives that are intended to generate profitable sales growth, improve profit margins, and expand returns on capital over time.
Recent developments in the Companys strategies and action plans include:  Pricing initiatives: The Company has faced significant increases in input costs during fiscal 2008 and expects this trend to continue into fiscal 2009. The Company implemented price increases across a significant portion of its Consumer Foods portfolio in the latter portion of fiscal 2008. The Company is continuing to monitor the challenging input cost environment and plans to implement additional pricing actions designed to offset these effects.
Innovation: The Companys recent innovation investments in its Consumer Foods operations resulted in the development of a variety of new products.
Healthy Choice  Caf Steamers, Healthy Choice  Panini, new flavors of Healthy Choice  Soups, Hunts  Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes, Orville Redenbachers  Smart Pop! Low Sodium, Orville Redenbachers  Natural, Chef Boyardee  Mac& Cheese, PAM  Professional, and Fleischmanns  and Parkay  Soft Spreads were introduced to the market during fiscal 2008. In addition, the Companys Food and Ingredients businesses, principally Lamb Weston, ConAgra Mills, and Gilroy Foods and Flavors, continue to invest in a variety of new foodservice products and ingredients for foodservice, food manufacturing, and industrial customers. These new products contributed to unit volume and sales growth in fiscal 2008. Together with additional new products planned for fiscal 2009 and beyond, these products are expected to contribute to additional sales growth and market expansion in the future.
Sales growth initiatives: The Company is continuing to implement sales improvement initiatives focused on penetrating the fastest growing channels, better return on customer trade arrangements, and optimal shelf placement for the Companys most profitable products. These, along with the marketing initiatives, are intended to generate profitable sales growth.
Reducing costs throughout the supply chain and the general and administrative functions:  The Company began an intense focus on cost reduction initiatives in February 2006, when it initiated the fiscal 2006-2008 restructuring plan (the 2006-2008 restructuring plan).
15 Table of Contents Substantially completed during fiscal 2008, the 2006-2008 restructuring plan focused on streamlining the supply chain and reducing selling, general and administrative costs. During fiscal 2008, the Company identified additional opportunities to create a more efficient organization, particularly in its Consumer Foods operations and related functional organizations and its International Foods operation (the 2008-2009 restructuring plan). The combined cost of these plans, updated through May25, 2008, is forecasted at $276 million. The Company has incurred total charges under these plans, since inception through May25, 2008, of an aggregate of $259 million. Together, these plans were approved with the expectation they would result in significant cost savings. The fiscal 2008-2009 restructuring plan is expected to generate new annual savings of $40 million in future years.
References to the Companys restructuring plans (the plans) refer to both the 2006-2008 restructuring plan and the 2008-2009 restructuring plan, unless otherwise noted.
In addition to restructuring activities, the Company has ongoing initiatives, principally focused on supply chain activities- manufacturing, logistics, and procurement functions, which have resulted in significant cost savings in recent periods.
Portfolio changes: In recent years, the Company divested operations that limited its ability to achieve efficiency targets and focus resources on core food businesses. The divestiture of these operations has helped to simplify the Companys operations and is expected to enhance efficiency initiatives and allow greater investment in core food businesses going forward.
Discontinued Operations . The results of operations for the trading and merchandising operations, principally comprising the Trading and Merchandising reporting segment, which were divested in June 2008 (subsequent to the Companys fiscal 2008 year end), the Knotts Berry Farm  jelly and jam operations, which were divested in May 2008, and the packaged meats and packaged cheese businesses, which were divested in fiscal 2007, are reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Capital Allocation During fiscal 2008, the Company funded the following:  capital expenditures of approximately $451 million;  dividend payments of approximately $362 million;  the repurchase of approximately $188 million (approximately 7.5million shares) of common stock;  the acquisition of Watts Brothers, a privately held group of vegetable processing and agricultural operations, for approximately $132 million in cash plus assumed liabilities of approximately $101 million, including debt of approximately $84 million. Immediately following the close of the transaction, the Company retired approximately $64 million of the debt;  the acquisition of Alexia Foods, a privately held natural food company for approximately $50 million in cash plus assumed liabilities. Alexia Foods offers premium natural and organic food items including potato products, appetizers, and artisan breads;  the acquisition of Lincoln Snacks, a privately held company offering a variety of snack food brands and private label products, for approximately $50 million in cash plus assumed liabilities; and  the acquisition of assets of Twin City Foods, a potato processing business, for approximately $23 million in cash.
The Company has repurchased its shares from time to time based on market conditions. The Company began fiscal 2008 with an authorization to purchase up to $88 million of its common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. During fiscal 2008, the Board of Directors authorized management to 16 Table of Contents repurchase up to an additional $500 million of the Companys common stock. Subsequent to fiscal 2008, the Companys authorization was increased an additional $500 million. The Company initiated an accelerated share repurchase program during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 under which it will exhaust its current share repurchase authorization through the expenditure of up to $900 million to repurchase its common stock.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Board of Directors increased the rate of regular, quarterly dividends on the Companys common stock to $0.19 per common share.
On June23, 2008, the Company completed the sale of its trading and merchandising operations, principally comprising its Trading and Merchandising reporting segment. Proceeds were comprised of (1)approximately $2.2 billion of cash, net of transaction costs (including incentive compensation amounts due to ConAgra Trade Group employees), (2)paid-in-kind debt securities issued by the purchaser with aggregate principal amount of $550 million to be recorded at fair market value of $483 million, (3)a short-term receivable of $37 million due from the purchaser, and (4)a warrant to purchase approximately 5% of the equity of the purchaser, to be recorded at estimated fair market value of $2 million. The Company expects to use the cash proceeds to complete the share repurchase discussed above and to significantly reduce its commercial paper balances.
Opportunities and Challenges The Company believes that its operating initiatives will favorably impact future sales, profits, profit margins, and returns on capital. Because of the scope of change underway, there is risk that these broad change initiatives will not be successfully implemented. Input costs, competitive pressures, the ability to execute the operational changes and implement pricing actions, among other factors, will affect the timing and impact of these initiatives.
The Company has faced increased costs for many of its significant raw materials, packaging, and energy inputs. The Company seeks to mitigate the higher input costs through pricing and productivity initiatives, and through the use of derivative instruments used to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption. The Company expects to take further price increases during fiscal 2009. The Company is also focusing on selling, general and administrative cost initiatives, as evidenced by the initiation of the Companys restructuring plans. However, the Company expects higher input costs to continue into fiscal 2009. If the benefits from pricing actions, supply chain productivity improvements, economic hedges, and selling, general and administrative cost reduction initiatives are insufficient to cover these expected higher input costs, results of operations, particularly Consumer Foods operating profit, may continue to be negatively impacted.
Changing consumer preferences may impact sales of certain of the Companys products. The Company offers a variety of food products which appeal to a range of consumer preferences and utilizes innovation and marketing programs to develop products that fit with changing consumer trends. As part of these programs, the Company introduces new products and product extensions.
Consolidation of many of the Companys customers continues to result in increased buying power, negotiating strength, and complex service requirements for those customers. This trend, which is expected to continue, may negatively impact gross margins, particularly in the Consumer Foods segment. In order to effectively respond to this customer consolidation, the Company is continually evaluating its consumer marketing, sales, and customer service strategies. The Company is implementing trade promotion programs designed to improve return on investment, and pursuing shelf placement and customer service improvement initiatives.
Other Significant Items of NoteItems Impacting Comparability The Company faced two significant product recalls during fiscal 2007 and 2008 that impact comparability of results. In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company initiated the recall of all varieties of peanut butter 17 Table of Contents manufactured at its Sylvester, Georgia plant. Product reintroduction began in August 2007. In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company voluntarily recalled all of its Banquet and private label pot pies. Product reintroduction began in December 2007.
Items of note impacting comparability for fiscal 2008 included the following: Reported within Continuing Operations  charges totaling $45 million ($28 million after tax) related to product recalls,  charges totaling $26 million ($16 million after tax) under the Companys restructuring plans, and  net tax benefits of approximately $19 million related to changes in the Companys legal entity structure, favorable settlements, and changes in estimates.
Items of note impacting comparability for fiscal 2007 included the following: Reported within Continuing Operations  charges totaling $103 million ($64 million after tax) under the Companys 2006-2008 restructuring plan,  charges totaling $66 million ($41 million after tax) related to the peanut butter recall,  gains of approximately $21 million ($13 million after tax) related to the divestiture of an oat milling business and other non-core assets,  benefits of $13 million ($8 million after tax) resulting from favorable legal settlements,  a benefit of approximately $7 million ($5 million after tax) resulting from a favorable resolution of franchise tax matters,  net tax charges of approximately $6 million related to unfavorable settlements and changes in estimates, and  a gain of approximately $4 million resulting from the sale of an equity investment in a malt business, and related income tax benefits of approximately $4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of approximately $8 million.
Reported within Discontinued Operations  gain of approximately $66 million ($37 million after tax) primarily from the divestiture of the packaged cheese business and a dietary supplement business,  charges of approximately $21 million ($13 million after tax) related to an impairment charge based upon the final negotiations of the sale of the packaged meats business, and  a benefit of approximately $9 million ($6 million after tax) related to a postretirement curtailment gain associated with the divestiture of the packaged meats operations.
SEGMENT REVIEW The Company reports its continuing operations in three reporting segments: Consumer Foods, Food and Ingredients, and International Foods.
18 Table of Contents Consumer Foods The Consumer Foods reporting segment includes branded, private label, and customized food products which are sold in various retail and foodservice channels. The products include a variety of categories (meals, entrees, condiments, sides, snacks, and desserts) across frozen, refrigerated, and shelf-stable temperature classes.
Food and Ingredients The Food and Ingredients reporting segment includes commercially branded foods and ingredients, which are sold principally to foodservice, food manufacturing, and industrial customers. The segments primary products include specialty potato products, milled grain ingredients, dehydrated vegetables and seasonings, blends, and flavors.
International Foods The International Foods reporting segment includes branded food products which are sold in retail channels principally in North America, Europe, and Asia. The products include a variety of categories (meals, entrees, condiments, sides, snacks, and desserts) across frozen, refrigerated, and shelf-stable temperature classes.
At the beginning of fiscal 2008, the Company shifted management responsibility of its handheld product operations into the Consumer Foods segment from the Food and Ingredients segment, and a portion of its international snack export business from the Consumer Foods segment to the International Foods segment. Accordingly, all prior periods have been recharacterized to reflect these changes.
In fiscal 2008, the Companys Board of Directors approved the 2008-2009 restructuring plan, which was recommended by executive management to streamline the Companys international operations and to improve the efficiency of the Companys Consumer Foods and related functional organizations. The plan includes the reorganization of the Consumer Foods operations, integration of the international headquarters function into the Companys domestic Consumer Foods business, exiting of a number of international markets, and reducing administrative headcount. Together, these actions are intended to reduce manufacturing and selling, general and administrative costs, and improve operating margins. The Company has also begun transitioning the direct management of the Consumer Foods reporting segment to the Chief Executive Officer. As a result of these plans, which are expected to be fully implemented early in fiscal 2009, the Company expects to change its reporting segments beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
2008 vs. 2007 Net Sales ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal2008 Net Sales Fiscal2007 Net Sales %Increase Consumer Foods $ 6,800 $ 6,497 5 % Food and Ingredients 4,128 3,422 21 % International Foods 678 613 10 % Total $ 11,606 $ 10,532 10 % Overall, Company net sales increased $1.1 billion to $11.6 billion in fiscal 2008, reflecting increased pricing in the milling and specialty potato operations of the Food and Ingredients segment and increased volume and pricing in the Consumer Foods segment.
19 Table of Contents Consumer Foods net sales increased $303 million, or 5%, for the year to $6.8 billion. Results reflect an increase of three percentage points from improved net pricing and product mix and two percentage points of improvement from higher volumes. Net pricing and volume improvements were achieved in many of the Companys priority investment and enabler brands. The impact of product recalls partially offset these improvements. The Company implemented significant price increases for many Consumer Foods products during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Continued net sales improvements are expected into fiscal 2009 when the Company expects to receive the benefit of these pricing actions for full fiscal periods. Sales of some of the Companys most significant brands, including Chef Boyardee  , DAVID  , Egg Beaters  , Healthy Choice  , Hebrew National  , Hunts  , Marie Callenders  , Manwich  , Orville Redenbachers  , PAM  , Ro*Tel  , Rosarita  , Snack Pack  , Swiss Miss  , Wesson  , and Wolf  grew in fiscal 2008. Sales of ACT II  , Andy Capp  , Banquet  , Crunch n Munch  , Kid Cuisine  , Parkay  , Pemmican  , Reddi-Wip  , and Slim Jim  declined in fiscal 2008.
Net sales in the Consumer Foods segment are not comparable across periods due to a variety of factors. The Company initiated a peanut butter recall in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and reintroduced Peter Pan  peanut butter products in August 2007. Sales of all peanut butter products, including both branded and private label, in fiscal 2008 were $14 million lower than comparable amounts in fiscal 2007. Consumer Foods net sales were also adversely impacted by the recall of Banquet  and private label pot pies in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Net sales of pot pies were lower by approximately $22 million in fiscal 2008, relative to fiscal 2007, primarily due to product returns and lost sales of Banquet  and private label pot pies. Sales from Alexia Foods and Lincoln Snacks, businesses acquired in fiscal 2008, totaled $66 million in fiscal 2008. The Company divested a refrigerated pizza business during the first half of fiscal 2007. Sales from this business were $17 million in fiscal 2007.
Food and Ingredients net sales were $4.1 billion in fiscal 2008, an increase of $706 million, or 21%. Increased sales are reflective of higher sales prices in the Companys milling operations due to higher grain prices, and price and volume increases in the Companys potato and dehydrated vegetable operations. The fiscal 2007 divestiture of an oat milling operation resulted in a reduction of sales of $27 million for fiscal 2008, partially offset by increased sales of $18 million from the acquisition of Watts Brothers in February 2008.
International Foods net sales increased $65 million to $678 million. The strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for approximately $36 million of this increase. The segment achieved a 5% increase in sales volume in fiscal 2008, primarily reflecting increased unit sales in Canada and Mexico, and modest increases in net pricing.
Gross Profit (Net Sales less Cost of Goods Sold) ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal2008 GrossProfit Fiscal2007 GrossProfit %Increase/ (Decrease) Consumer Foods $ 1,802 $ 1,923 (6 )% Food and Ingredients 724 590 23 % International Foods 190 180 6 % Total $ 2,716 $ 2,693 1 % The Companys gross profit for fiscal 2008 was $2.7 billion, an increase of $23 million, or 1%, over the prior year. The increase in gross profit was largely driven by results in the Food and Ingredients segment, reflecting higher margins in the Companys milling and specialty potato operations, largely offset by reduced gross profits in the Consumer Foods segment. Costs of implementing the Companys restructuring plans reduced gross profit by $4 million and $46 million in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively.
20 Table of Contents Consumer Foods gross profit for fiscal 2008 was $1.8 billion, a decrease of $121 million, or 6%, from the prior year. The decrease in gross profit reflected significantly higher input costs, partially offset by improved net pricing, mix, and volume. The increased input costs were partially offset by productivity improvements and gains on derivatives held to economically hedge current and future input costs. The factors impacting comparability of Consumer Foods net sales also impact the comparability of Consumer Foods gross profit. Due to the peanut butter recall that was initiated in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and the subsequent reintroduction of Peter Pan  peanut butter products in August 2007, gross profits in the Consumer Foods segment are not comparable across periods. Consumer Foods gross profit from all peanut butter products, including both branded and private label, in fiscal 2008 were $22 million lower than comparable amounts in fiscal 2007. Consumer Foods gross profit on Banquet  and private label pot pies products were lower by approximately $23 million in fiscal 2008, relative to fiscal 2007, primarily due to product returns and lost sales. Newly acquired businesses contributed $11 million to gross profit in fiscal 2008. Costs of implementing the Companys restructuring plans reduced gross profit for fiscal 2008 and 2007 by $2 million and $45 million, respectively.
Food and Ingredients gross profit was $724 million for fiscal 2008, an increase of $134 million, or 23%, over the prior year. Improved results reflect increased gross profit of $68 million in the Companys milling operations due to a favorable wheat commodity environment and improved flour conversion margins. The Company also achieved increased gross profit of $65 million in its specialty potato business as benefits from pricing, volume growth, and product mix management exceeded the impact of higher input costs. Results also reflected gains on derivatives held to economically hedge current and future input costs as well as profits from wheat derivatives trading.
International Foods gross profit was $190 million, an increase of $10 million over the prior fiscal year. Fiscal 2008 performance reflected increased sales volume of 5%, partially offset by higher input costs, modest net pricing increases and a benefit of $11 million due to favorable foreign currency exchange rate changes. Gross profit for fiscal 2008 also reflects $2 million of charges related to the execution of the Companys restructuring plans.
Gross Margin (Gross Profit as a Percentage of Net Sales) Reporting Segment Fiscal2008 GrossMargin Fiscal 2007 GrossMargin Consumer Foods 27 % 30 % Food and Ingredients 18 % 17 % International Foods 28 % 29 % Total Company (continuing operations) 23 % 26 % The Companys gross margin for fiscal 2008 decreased three percentage points compared to fiscal 2007, primarily reflecting the impact of significantly increased input costs in the Consumer Foods segment which were not offset by net price increases and productivity improvements. The Company implemented price increases in March of fiscal 2008, the benefits of which are expected to be greater in future periods. The gross margin in the Consumer Foods segment has also been negatively impacted in both fiscal 2008 and 2007 by the costs of product recalls and the costs of implementing the Companys restructuring plans. Gross margin in the Food and Ingredients segment improved due to the factors noted above under Gross Profit.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (includes General Corporate Expense) (SG&A) SG&A expenses totaled $1.8 billion for fiscal 2008, virtually unchanged from the prior fiscal year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2008 reflected the following:  a decrease in advertising and promotion expense of $58 million,  an increase in salaries expense of $45 million, 21 Table of Contents  a decrease in incentive compensation expense of $41 million,  charges of $22 million related to the execution of the Companys restructuring plans,  charges related to product recalls of $21 million,  $14 million of income, net of direct pass-through costs, for reimbursement of expenses related to transition services provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses, and  a decrease in charitable contributions of $12 million.
Included in SG&A expenses for fiscal 2007 were the following items:  charges of $57 million related to the Companys restructuring plans,  charges related to the peanut butter recall of $36 million,  $23 million of income, net of direct pass-through costs, for reimbursement of expenses related to transition services provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses,  gains of $27 million related to the disposition of an oat milling business, certain international licensing rights for a small brand, and four corporate aircraft,  a benefit of $13 million for favorable legal settlements, and  a benefit of $7 million related to a favorable resolution of franchise tax matters.

The decrease for the fiscal year was reflective of the decreased gross profit, discussed above, and was influenced by a number of factors, including:  restructuring costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses of $6 million and $39 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively,  costs of the product recalls classified in selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $21 million and $36 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively,  a decrease in advertising and promotion costs of approximately $45 million, and  a $23 million decrease in transition services reimbursement income, net of direct pass-through costs, related to transition services provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, similar reimbursement income of $14 million is reflected in general corporate expenses and did not impact operating profit.
Food and Ingredients operating profit increased $77 million to $512 million in fiscal 2008. Operating profit improvement was principally driven by the improved gross profit, as discussed above. Other factors affecting the increased operating profit included higher selling expense and compensation costs in fiscal 2008, and gains recorded in fiscal 2007 of $18 million related to the Companys sale of an oat milling business and $8 million resulting from a legal settlement related to a fire.
22 Table of Contents International Foods operating profit decreased $15 million to $49 million in fiscal 2008. Operating profit included the increase in gross profit offset by $16 million of costs associated with the implementation of the Companys restructuring plans. Fiscal 2007 operating profit included a gain of approximately $4 million related to the sale of certain international licensing rights for a small brand and $2 million of charges related to the peanut butter recall.
Interest Expense, Net In fiscal 2008, net interest expense was $253 million, an increase of $34 million, or 15%, over the prior fiscal year. Increased interest expense reflects the Companys use of commercial paper to finance higher working capital balances in all segments, particularly in the Trading and Merchandising business which is now presented within discontinued operations. The Company also earned less interest income due to lower balances of cash on hand in fiscal 2008.
Equity Method Investment Earnings The Company includes its share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on its economic ownership interest in the affiliates. Significant affiliates produce and market potato products for retail and foodservice customers. The Companys share of earnings from the Companys equity method investments were $50 million and $28 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase was driven by improved performance of a foreign potato venture.
Results of Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations was $412 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2008. Included in these amounts are:  pre-tax earnings of $669 million, largely the result of very strong profits from the fertilizer, agricultural merchandising, energy trading, and agricultural trading operations of the Trading and Merchandising business, and  income tax expense of $257 million.
Income from discontinued operations was $282 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2007. Included in these amounts are:  pre-tax earnings of $457 million from operations of discontinued businesses, largely the result of strong profits from the trading of fertilizer and crude oil in the trading and merchandising business, a pre-tax curtailment gain of $9 million related to postretirement benefits of the packaged meats operations divested in fiscal 2007, and an $8 million gain related to a legal settlement in connection with the packaged meats operations,  impairment charges of $21 million based on the final negotiations related to the sale of the packaged meats operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2007,  a gain of $64 million primarily from the disposition of the Companys packaged cheese business and a dietary supplement business, and  income tax expense of $175 million.
Income Taxes and Net Income The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 31% for fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2008, the Company adjusted its estimates of income taxes payable due to increased benefits from a domestic manufacturing deduction and lower foreign income taxes, resulting in a lower than normal effective tax rate. These impacts and tax benefits related to a change in the legal structure of the Companys subsidiaries are the primary contributors to the decrease in the year-to-date effective tax rate from fiscal 2007.
23 Table of Contents The effective tax rate was 34% in fiscal 2007. In 2007, state income taxes included approximately $24 million of benefits related to the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in estimates, principally related to state tax jurisdictions. This was offset by the tax impact of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit settlement.
The Company expects its effective tax rate in fiscal 2009, exclusive of any unusual transactions or tax events, to be in the range of 35% to 36%.
Net income was $931 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, in fiscal 2008, compared to $765 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, in fiscal 2007.
2007 vs. 2006 Net Sales ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal2007 Net Sales Fiscal2006 Net Sales %Increase/ (Decrease) Consumer Foods $ 6,497 $ 6,511  % Food and Ingredients 3,422 3,129 9 % International Foods 613 611  % Total $ 10,532 $ 10,251 3 % Overall, Company net sales increased $281 million to $10.5 billion in fiscal 2007, primarily reflecting favorable results in the Food and Ingredients segment. Increased net sales at the Food and Ingredients segment were primarily the result of price and volume increases. The Consumer Foods and International Foods segments were relatively flat compared to prior year.
The peanut butter recall had a negative impact on the Companys fiscal year net sales for the Consumer Foods and International Foods reporting segments. Sales of peanut butter in fiscal 2007 were $92 million, as compared to $147 million in fiscal 2006.
Consumer Foods net sales decreased $14 million for the year to $6.5 billion. Sales volume declined by 1% in fiscal 2007. Results reflect the effect of price increases and sales growth in certain of the Companys priority investment brands, offset by the impact of the peanut butter recall, declines in sales of low-margin foodservice and private label items, the divestiture of a refrigerated pizza business during the first half of fiscal 2007, and continued SKU rationalization efforts. Net sales of the Companys priority investment brands, which represented approximately 75% of total segment sales during fiscal 2007, increased 1% as a group. Sales growth for some of the Companys most significant brands, including Chef Boyardee  , Egg Beaters  , Hebrew National  , Hunts  , Kid Cuisine  , Orville Redenbachers  , PAM  , Slim Jim  , Snack Pack  , Reddi-Wip  , Manwich  , Swiss Miss  , and DAVID  , was largely offset by sales declines for the year for Banquet  , Healthy Choice  , ACT II  , LaChoy  , Pemmican  , The Max  , and Peter Pan  . Peanut butter net sales declined by $55 million from the prior year due to the peanut butter recall.
Food and Ingredients net sales increased $293 million to $3.4 billion, primarily reflecting price and volume increases for potato and dehydrated vegetable operations, as well as price increases in the wheat milling operations resulting from higher year over year grain prices.
International Foods net sales increased $2 million to $613 million. The strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for a $6 million increase. Growth of the priority investment brands, primarily in Canada and Mexico, was offset by sales declines related to the discontinuance of a number of low margin products and the effect of the peanut butter recall.

Costs of implementing the Companys 2006-2008 restructuring plan reduced gross profit by $46 million and $20 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Fiscal 2007 results include the impact of approximately $30 million due to the peanut butter recall, reflected as a reduction of net sales of $19 million, and an increase of $11 million in cost of goods sold.
Consumer Foods gross profit for fiscal 2007 was $1.9 billion, an increase of $74 million from fiscal 2006. Costs of implementing the Companys 2006-2008 restructuring plan reduced gross profit by $45 million and $20 million for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Also included in fiscal 2007 gross profit is the impact of approximately $29 million due to the peanut butter recall. The increase in gross profit for fiscal 2007 was largely driven by supply chain cost improvements and improved product mix, partially offset by the effects of inflation, the peanut butter recall, and restructuring costs, as discussed above.
Food and Ingredients gross profit for fiscal 2007 was $590 million, an increase of $64 million over the prior year. Costs of implementing the Companys 2006-2008 restructuring plan reduced gross profit for fiscal 2007 by $1 million. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by the increase in net sales, discussed above, partially offset by the divestiture of an oat milling business in the first half of fiscal 2007.
International Foods gross profit for fiscal 2007 was $180 million, an increase of $14 million over the prior fiscal year. The increase included $2 million resulting from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in gross profit also reflected the increases in net sales, as discussed above, favorable product mix and reductions in supply chain costs. Gross profit was reduced by approximately $1 million due to the peanut butter recall.
Gross Margin (Gross Profit as a Percentage of Net Sales) Reporting Segment Fiscal2007 GrossMargin Fiscal2006 GrossMargin Consumer Foods 30 % 28 % Food and Ingredients 17 % 17 % International Foods 29 % 27 % Total Company (continuing operations) 26 % 25 % The Companys gross margin for fiscal 2007 was up one percentage point compared to fiscal 2006, primarily reflecting the impact of productivity improvements in the Consumer Foods and Food and Ingredients segments. The impact of these productivity improvements was somewhat offset by reduced margins due to the effects of inflation, the Companys restructuring charges, and the peanut butter recall.
25 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (includes General Corporate Expense) (SG&A) SG&A expenses totaled $1.8 billion for fiscal 2007, a decrease of $68 million from the prior fiscal year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2007 reflected:  an increase in advertising and promotion expense of $118 million,  an increase in management incentive expenses of $84 million,  charges of $57 million related to the execution of the Companys 2006-2008 restructuring plan,  $23 million of income, net of direct pass-through costs, for reimbursement of expenses related to transition services provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses,  charges related to the peanut butter recall of $36 million,  a decrease in selling and marketing expense of $42 million,  gains of $27 million related to the disposition of an oat milling business, certain international licensing rights for a small brand, and four corporate aircraft,  charges of $20 million related to expensing of stock options in accordance with SFAS No.123R,  a decrease in professional fees of $25 million,  an increase in cash charitable donations of $16 million, partially offset by a decrease in product charitable donations of $8 million,  a benefit of $13 million for favorable legal settlements, and  a benefit of $7 million related to a favorable resolution of franchise tax matters.
Included in SG&A expenses for fiscal 2006 were the following items:  charges of $109 million related to the Companys 2006-2008 restructuring plan,  charges of $83 million on an impairment of note from Swift& Company,  charges of $30 million on the early retirement of debt,  a charge of $19 million for severance of key executives (including a charge of approximately $11 million related to incentive compensation plans),  a charge of $17 million for patent-related litigation expense, and  a charge of $6 million for the impairment of an international manufacturing facility.

The increase for the fiscal year is reflective of the increased gross profit, discussed above, and was influenced by a number of factors, including:  restructuring costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses of $39 million and $64 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively,  costs of the peanut butter recall related to selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $35 million,  an increase in advertising and promotion costs of approximately $93 million,  an increase in incentive costs of approximately $42 million,  a decrease in selling and marketing expenses of $38 million, and  reimbursement income of approximately $23 million, net of direct pass-through costs, related to transition services provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses.
Food and Ingredients operating profit increased $81 million to $435 million in fiscal 2007. Operating profit improvement was principally driven by the improved gross margins, as discussed above. Other factors affecting the operating profit change over fiscal 2006 included: lower selling, general and administrative expenses related to the implementation of the Companys 2006-2008 restructuring plan by $6 million versus fiscal 2006; gains recorded in fiscal 2007 of $18 million related to the Companys sale of an oat milling business and $8 million resulting from a legal settlement related to a fire; and increased incentive and selling expenses versus fiscal 2006.
International Foods operating profit increased $2 million to $64 million in fiscal 2007. Operating profit included the increase in gross profit, as discussed above, as well as a gain of approximately $4 million related to the sale of certain international licensing rights for a small brand. These gains were substantially offset by increased advertising and promotion, and selling and marketing expenses, principally due to the expansion of global markets. Fiscal 2006 operating profit was reduced by $6 million in connection with the closure of a production facility in Canada.
Interest Expense, Net In fiscal 2007, net interest expense was $220 million, a decrease of $52 million, or 19%, over the prior fiscal year. Decreased interest expense reflects the Companys retirement of nearly $900 million of debt during fiscal 2006, as well as the Companys retirement of nearly $47 million of debt during fiscal 2007. These factors were partially offset by a reduced benefit from certain interest rate swap agreements terminated in fiscal 2004. The benefit associated with the termination of the interest rate swap agreements continues to be recognized over the term of the debt instruments originally hedged. As a result, the Companys net interest expense was reduced by $4 million during fiscal 2007 and $12 million during fiscal 2006.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company completed an exchange of approximately $200 million principal amount of its 9.75% subordinated notes due 2021 and $300 million principal amount of its 6.75% senior notes due 2011 for approximately $500 million principal amount of 5.82% senior notes due 2017 and cash of approximately $90 million. The Company is amortizing the $90 million cash payment over the life of the new notes within net interest expense.
Gain on Sale of Pilgrims Pride Corporation Common Stock During fiscal 2006, the Company sold its remaining 15.4million shares of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock for $482 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $329 million.
27 Table of Contents Equity Method Investment Earnings (Loss) During fiscal 2006, the Company recognized impairment charges totaling $76 million ($73 million after tax) of its investments in a malt venture and an unrelated investment in a foreign prepared foods business, due to declines in the estimated proceeds from the disposition of these investments. The investment in the foreign prepared foods business was disposed of in fiscal 2006. The extent of the impairments was determined based upon the Companys assessment of the recoverability of its investments based primarily upon the expected proceeds of planned dispositions of the investments.
During fiscal 2007, the Company completed the disposition of the equity method investment in the malt venture for proceeds of approximately $24 million, including notes and other receivables totaling approximately $7 million. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $4 million, with a related tax benefit of approximately $4 million.
The Companys share of earnings from the Companys remaining equity method investments, which include potato processing and grain merchandising businesses, increased by approximately $7 million from the comparable amount in fiscal 2006, driven by improved yields in the potato processing business.
Results of Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations was $282 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2007. Included in these amounts were:  pre-tax earnings of $457 million from discontinued businesses (which principally include the trading and merchandising operations and the packaged meats and cheese businesses), including:  a gain of $64 million primarily from the disposition of the Companys packaged cheese business and a dietary supplement business in fiscal 2007,  impairment charges of $21 million in fiscal 2007, based on the final negotiations related to the sale of the packaged meats operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2007,  a pre-tax curtailment gain of $9 million related to postretirement benefits of the packaged meats operations divested in fiscal 2007, and  an $8 million gain related to a legal settlement in connection with the packaged meats operations,  income tax expense of $175 million.
In fiscal 2006, the Company recognized income from discontinued operations of $70 million, net of tax. Included in these amounts were:  pre-tax earnings of $251 million from operations of discontinued businesses, which principally include the recently divested trading and merchandising operations, the divested packaged meat and cheese operations, and the divested Cooks Ham business, which include:  impairment charges of $241 million to reduce the carrying value of assets held for sale from the Companys discontinued packaged meats business to their estimated fair value less costs to sell,  a gain on the disposition of the Companys Cooks Ham business of $110 million, and  income tax expense of $181 million.
Income Taxes and Net Income The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 34% for fiscal 2007. In 2007, state income taxes included approximately $24 million of benefits related to the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in estimates, principally related to state tax jurisdictions. These benefits were offset by the tax impact of an IRS audit settlement.
28 Table of Contents The effective tax rate was 34% in fiscal 2006. In 2006, state income taxes included approximately $26 million of benefits related to the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in estimates, principally related to state tax jurisdictions. This was largely offset by the tax impact of impairments of equity method investments for which the Company does not expect to receive a significant tax benefit.
Net income was $765 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, in fiscal 2007, compared to $534 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, in fiscal 2006.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sources of Liquidity and Capital The Companys primary financing objective is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides the Company flexibility to pursue its growth objectives. The Company currently uses short-term debt principally to finance ongoing operations, including its seasonal working capital (accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets, less accounts payable, accrued payroll, and other accrued liabilities) needs and a combination of equity and long-term debt to finance both its base working capital needs and its noncurrent assets.
Commercial paper borrowings (usually less than 30 days maturity) are reflected in the Companys consolidated balance sheets within notes payable. At May25, 2008, the Company had credit lines from banks that totaled approximately $2.3 billion. These lines are comprised of a $1.5 billion multi-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions which matures in December 2011, uncommitted short-term loan facilities approximating $364 million, and uncommitted trade finance facilities approximating $424 million. The multi-year facility is a back-up facility for the Companys commercial paper program. Borrowings under the multi-year facility bear interest at or below prime rate and may be prepaid without penalty. These rates are approximately .10 to .15 percentage points higher than the interest rates for commercial paper. The Company has not drawn upon this multi-year facility. As of May25, 2008, the Company had short-term notes payable of $578 million that were comprised primarily of commercial paper. The multi-year facility requires the Company to repay borrowings if the Companys consolidated funded debt exceeds 65% of the consolidated capital base, as defined, or if fixed charges coverage, as defined, is less than 1.75 to 1.0, as such terms are defined in applicable agreements. As of the end of fiscal 2008, the Company was in compliance with these financial covenants.
The uncommitted trade finance facilities noted above were maintained in order to finance certain working capital needs of the Companys trading and merchandising operations. Subsequent to the sale of these operations in June 2008, the Company exited these facilities.
The Company finances its short-term liquidity needs with bank borrowings, commercial paper borrowings, and bankers acceptances. The average consolidated short-term borrowings outstanding under these facilities were $419 million and $4 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in commercial paper borrowings was primarily due to higher working capital needs during the year, principally in the recently divested trading and merchandising operations.
The Companys overall level of interest-bearing long-term debt, inclusive of current maturities, totaled $3.5 billion at the end of both fiscal 2008 and 2007. In December 2006, the Company completed an exchange of approximately $200 million principal amount of its 9.75% subordinated notes due 2021 and $300 million principal amount of its 6.75% senior notes due 2011 for approximately $500 million principal amount of 5.82% senior notes due 2017 and cash of approximately $90 million, in order to improve the Companys debt maturity profile. The Company is amortizing the $90 million cash payment (the unamortized portion of which is reflected as a reduction of senior long-term debt in the Companys consolidated balance sheet at May25, 2008) over the life of the new notes within interest expense.
As part of the Watts Brothers acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company assumed $84 million of debt, of which the Company immediately repaid $64 million.
29 Table of Contents The Company made scheduled principal payments of debt and payments of lease financing obligations during fiscal 2008, reducing long-term debt by $21 million.
As of the end of both fiscal 2008 and 2007, the Companys senior long-term debt ratings were all investment grade. A significant downgrade in the Companys credit ratings would not affect the Companys ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facilities, although borrowing costs would increase. A downgrade to the Companys short-term credit ratings would also affect the Companys ability to borrow under its commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations, as well as potentially limiting access.
The Company also has an effective shelf registration statement under which it could issue, from time to time, up to $4 billion in debt securities.
In March 2006, the Company completed the divestitures of its Cooks Ham and its seafood businesses for cash proceeds of approximately $442 million. During fiscal 2007, the Company sold its refrigerated meats business, its cheese business, its refrigerated pizza business, an oat milling business, and a dietary supplement business for proceeds of approximately $717 million.
During fiscal 2007, the Company sold notes receivable from Swift Foods for approximately $117 million, net of transaction expenses. The notes had been received in connection with the divestiture of a fresh beef and pork business in fiscal 2003.
The Company has repurchased its shares from time to time based on market conditions. The Company began fiscal 2008 with an authorization to purchase up to $88 million of its common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. During fiscal 2008, the Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase up to an additional $500 million of the Companys common stock. The Company repurchased $188 million of its shares during fiscal 2008. Subsequent to fiscal 2008, the Companys authorization increased an additional $500 million. The Company initiated an accelerated share repurchase program during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 under which it will exhaust its current share repurchase authorization through the purchase of up to $900 million of its common stock.
Subsequent to fiscal 2008, the Company received approximately $2.2 billion in cash, net of transaction costs, as a portion of the proceeds from the disposition of its trading and merchandising operations.
Cash Flows In fiscal 2008, the Company used $564 million of cash, which was the net result of $102 million generated from operating activities, $644 million used in investing activities, and $22 million used in financing activities.
Cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled $382 million for fiscal 2008 as compared to $851 million generated in fiscal 2007. Improved income from continuing operations was offset by a use of cash for working capital in fiscal 2008. The increased use of cash for working capital was largely due to increased inventory balances in the Consumer Foods and Food and Ingredients segments due to increased inventory quantities and higher wheat and potato prices. In addition to the working capital changes, the Company made contributions to its pension plans of $8 million and $172 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations was approximately $280 million in fiscal 2008, primarily due to the increased market value of commodity inventory balances and derivative assets, as compared to $93 million generated in fiscal 2007.
Cash used in investing activities totaled $644 million for fiscal 2008, versus cash generated from investing activities of $523 million in fiscal 2007. Investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2008 consisted primarily of expenditures of $255 million related to the acquisition of businesses (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) and capital expenditures of $490 million, which included approximately $39 million of expenditures related to the Companys purchase of certain warehouse facilities from its lessors (these warehouses 30 Table of Contents were sold for proceeds of approximately $36 million to unrelated third parties immediately thereafter), offset by $30 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. Investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2007 consisted primarily of proceeds of $117 million from the sale of notes receivable from Swift Foods, $74 million from the sale of property, plant and equipment, including the sale of four aircraft, and $74 million from the sale of an oat milling business, a refrigerated pizza business, and an equity method investment, offset by capital expenditures of $480 million, which included approximately $94 million of expenditures related to the Companys purchase of certain warehouse facilities from its lessors (these warehouses were sold for proceeds of approximately $92 million to unrelated third parties immediately thereafter). The Company generated $33 million from investing activities from discontinued operations in fiscal 2008, primarily from the sale of the Knotts Berry Farm  jams and jellies brand and operations, as compared to $632 million in fiscal 2007, primarily related to the divestitures of the Companys refrigerated meats and cheese businesses.
Cash used in financing activities totaled $22 million in fiscal 2008, as compared to cash used in financing activities of $1.1 billion in fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2008, the Company repurchased $188 million of its common stock as part of its share repurchase program and paid dividends of $362 million. As part of the Watts Brothers acquisition, the Company repaid $64 million of assumed long-term debt subsequent to the acquisition. In addition to these early retirements of debt, the Company made scheduled principal payments of debt and payments of lease financing obligations during fiscal 2008, reducing long-term debt by $21 million. Also, during fiscal 2008, the Company increased its short-term borrowings by $577 million, primarily reflecting the financing of significantly increased working capital. During fiscal 2007, the Company repurchased $615 million of its common stock as part of its share repurchase program, paid dividends of $367 million, and made a cash payment of $94 million, including issuance costs, as part of the previously discussed debt exchange. The Company redeemed $12 million of 8.8% unsecured debt due in May 2017 and made scheduled principal payments of debt and payments of lease financing obligations during fiscal 2007, reducing long-term debt by $35 million.
The Company estimates its capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 will be approximately $475 million. Management believes that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, divestiture proceeds, existing credit facilities, and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, planned share repurchases, and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company uses off-balance sheet arrangements (e.g., operating leases) where the economics and sound business principles warrant their use. The Company periodically enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. These are described further in Obligations and Commitments, below.
The Company consolidates the assets and liabilities of several entities from which it leases corporate aircraft. For periods ending prior to November25, 2007, the Company consolidated several entities from which it leases office buildings. Each of these entities had been determined to be a variable interest entity and the Company was determined to be the primary beneficiary of each of these entities. In September 2007, the Company ceased to be the primary beneficiary of the entities from which it leases office buildings and, accordingly, the Company discontinued the consolidation of the assets and liabilities of these entities.
Due to the consolidation of the variable interest entities, the Company reflected in its balance sheets: May25, 2008 May27, 2007 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 51.8 $ 155.9 Other assets  13.8 Current installments of long-term debt 3.3 6.1 Senior long-term debt, excluding current installments 50.9 144.1 Other accrued liabilities 0.6 0.6 Other noncurrent liabilities  21.9 31 Table of Contents The liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating these entities do not represent additional claims on the general assets of the Company. The creditors of these entities have claims only on the assets of the specific variable interest entities to which they have advanced credit.
OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS As part of its ongoing operations, the Company enters into arrangements that obligate the Company to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements, and unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as take-or-pay contracts). The unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into by the Company in its normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available to the Company. Capital lease and debt obligations, which totaled $3.5 billion at May25, 2008, are currently recognized as liabilities in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations, which totaled $1.7 billion at May25, 2008, are not recognized as liabilities in the Companys consolidated balance sheet, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A summary of the Companys contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2008 was as follows (including obligations of discontinued operations): ($ in millions) Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Lessthan 1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years After 5 Years Long-Term Debt $ 3,531.4 $ 15.4 $ 521.6 $ 751.8 $ 2,242.6 Lease Obligations 514.9 89.2 148.1 106.9 170.7 Purchase Obligations 1,199.6 1,078.6 104.0 16.3 0.7 Total $ 5,245.9 $ 1,183.2 $ 773.7 $ 875.0 $ 2,414.0 The purchase obligations noted in the table above do not reflect approximately $374 million of open purchase orders, some of which are not legally binding. These purchase orders are settlable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year.
The Company is also contractually obligated to pay interest on its long-term debt obligations. The weighted average interest rate of the long-term debt obligations outstanding as of May25, 2008 was approximately 7.2%.
The Company consolidates the assets and liabilities of certain entities from which it leases corporate aircraft. These entities have been determined to be variable interest entities and the Company has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of these entities. The amounts reflected in contractual obligations of long-term debt, in the table above, include $54 million of liabilities of these variable interest entities to the creditors of such entities. The long-term debt recognized as a result of consolidating these entities does not represent additional claims on the general assets of the Company. The creditors of these entities have claims only on the assets of the specific variable interest entities. As of May25, 2008, the Company was obligated to make rental payments of $67 million to the variable interest entities, of which $7 million is due in less than one year, $13 million is due in one to three years, and $47 million is due in three to five years. Such amounts are not reflected in the table, above.
As part of its ongoing operations, the Company also enters into arrangements that obligate the Company to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event (e.g., guarantee debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform). In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in the Companys 32 Table of Contents consolidated balance sheet. The Companys commitments, including commitments associated with equity method investments, as of the end of fiscal 2008, were as follows (including commitments of discontinued operations): ($ in millions) Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments Total Lessthan 1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years After5 Years Guarantees $ 55.3 $ 31.9 $ 7.9 $ 5.4 $ 10.1 Other Commitments 1.0 1.0    Total $ 56.3 $ 32.9 $ 7.9 $ 5.4 $ 10.1 The Companys total commitments of approximately $56 million include approximately $23 million in guarantees and other commitments the Company has made on behalf of the Companys divested fresh beef and pork business.
As part of the fresh beef and pork divestiture, the Company guaranteed the performance of the divested fresh beef and pork business with respect to a hog purchase contract. The hog purchase contract requires the divested fresh beef and pork business to purchase a minimum of approximately 1.2million hogs annually through 2014. The contract stipulates minimum price commitments, based in part on market prices, and in certain circumstances also includes price adjustments based on certain inputs.
The Company is a party to various potato supply agreements. Under the terms of certain agreements, the Company has guaranteed repayment of short-term bank loans of the potato suppliers, under certain conditions. At May25, 2008, the amount of supplier loans effectively guaranteed by the Company was approximately $26 million, included in the table above. The Company has not established a liability for these guarantees, as the Company has determined that the likelihood of its required performance under the guarantees is remote.
The obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for income taxes under FASB Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (as amended) , as the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement of its reserves for income taxes. The liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at May25, 2008 was $76 million.
TRADING ACTIVITIES The Company accounts for certain contracts (e.g., physical commodity purchase/sale contracts and derivative contracts) at fair value. The Company considers a portion of these contracts to be its trading activities. The following table excludes certain commodity-based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, including physical contracts to buy or sell commodities (generally within the Companys flour milling business and grain merchandising business, which is now included within discontinued operations) at agreed-upon fixed prices, as well as derivative contracts (e.g., futures and options) used primarily to create an economic hedge of an existing asset or liability (e.g., inventory) or an anticipated transaction (e.g., purchase of inventory). The use of such contracts is not considered by the Company to be trading activities as these contracts are considered either normal purchase and sale contracts or economic hedging contracts. The Company includes in the following table all derivative instruments, including physical contracts related to the trading of energy-related commodities (such as petroleum products and natural gas).
33 Table of Contents The following table represents the fair value and scheduled maturity dates of such contracts outstanding as of May25, 2008: ($ in millions) Fair Value of Contracts as of May25, 2008 Gross Asset Gross Liability Net Asset Total Fair Value Source of Fair Value Maturity less than 1 year Maturity 1-3 years Maturity less than 1 year Maturity 1-3years Maturity lessthan 1 year Maturity 1-3years Prices actively quoted $ 1,636.5 $ 62.1 $ (1,464.2 ) $ (12.6 ) $ 172.3 $ 49.5 $ 221.8 Prices provided by other external sources 188.7  (209.0 ) (0.3 ) (20.3 ) (0.3 ) (20.6 ) Prices based on other valuation models        Total fair value $ 1,825.2 $ 62.1 $ (1,673.2 ) $ (12.9 ) $ 152.0 $ 49.2 $ 201.2 A significant majority of the amounts in the table above reflect the activities of the recently divested trading and merchandising operations.
In order to minimize the risk of loss associated with non-exchange-traded transactions with counterparties, the Company utilizes established credit limits and performs ongoing counterparty credit evaluations.
The asset and liability amounts in the table above reflect gross positions and are not reduced for offsetting positions with a counterparty when a legal right of offset exists. The prices actively quoted category reflects only contracts for which the fair value is based entirely upon prices actively quoted on major exchanges in the United States. The prices provided by other external sources category represents contracts which contain a pricing component other than prices actively quoted on a major exchange, such as forward commodity positions at locations for which over-the-counter broker quotes are available.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management. The estimates used by management are based on the Companys historical experiences combined with managements understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Companys accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management of the Company.
The Companys Audit Committee has reviewed managements development, selection, and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates.
Marketing Costs The Company incurs certain costs to promote its products through marketing programs which include advertising, retailer incentives, and consumer incentives. The Company recognizes the cost of each of these types of marketing activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The judgment required in determining when marketing costs are incurred can be significant. For volume-based incentives provided to retailers, management must continually assess the likelihood of the retailer achieving the specified targets. Similarly, for consumer coupons, management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future. Estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on the Companys historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends. As these factors change, managements estimates could change and the Company could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time.
Historically, the Company has entered into over 150,000 individual marketing programs each year with customers, resulting in annual costs in excess of $2 billion, which are reflected as a reduction of net sales.
34 Table of Contents Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any of the individual customer marketing programs would not result in a material change in the Companys results of operations or cash flows.
Advertising and promotion expenses of continuing operations totaled $393 million, $452 million, and $334 million in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.
Income Taxes The Companys income tax expense is based on the Companys income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the Companys income tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties under Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes . Management reviews the Companys tax positions quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment. Management uses historical experience and short and long-range business forecasts to develop such estimates. Further, the Company employs various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. To the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.
Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Environmental Liabilities Environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated. Management works with independent third-party specialists in order to effectively assess the Companys environmental liabilities. Management estimates the Companys environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required cleanup, the known volumetric contribution of the Company, and other potentially responsible parties and its experience in remediating sites. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup. Managements estimate as to its potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements. Insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims. The Company does not discount its environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable. To the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above, managements estimate of environmental liabilities may also change.
The Company has recognized a reserve of approximately $95 million for environmental liabilities as of May25, 2008. Historically, the underlying assumptions utilized by the Company in estimating this reserve have been appropriate as actual payments have neither differed materially from the previously estimated reserve balances, nor have significant adjustments to this reserve balance been necessary. The reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy.
Employment-Related Benefits The Company incurs certain employment-related expenses associated with pensions, postretirement health care benefits, and workers compensation. In order to measure the expense associated with these employment-related benefits, management must make a variety of estimates including discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities, assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses, compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, anticipated health care costs, and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to the Company. The estimates used by 35 Table of Contents management are based on the Companys historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. The Company uses third-party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employment-related benefits. Different estimates used by management could result in the Company recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time.
The Company recognized pension expense of $65 million, $83 million, and $96 million in fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, which reflected expected returns on plan assets of $149 million, $134 million, and $130 million, respectively. The Company contributed $8 million, $172 million, and $36 million to the Companys pension plans in fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The Company anticipates contributing approximately $7 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2009.
One significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate. The Company selects a discount rate each year (as of its fiscal year-end measurement date for fiscal 2008 and thereafter) for its plans based upon a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the year-by-year projected benefit cash flows for the Companys pension plans. The hypothetical bond portfolio is comprised of high-quality fixed income debt instruments (usually Moodys Aa) available at the measurement date. Based on this information, the discount rate selected by the Company for determination of pension expense for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006 was 5.75%. The Company selected a discount rate of 6.6% for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2009. A 25 basis point increase in the Companys discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2008 would decrease pension expense for the Companys pension plans by $3.7 million for the year. A 25 basis point decrease in the Companys discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2008 would increase pension expense for the Companys pension plans by $9.6 million for the year. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense by approximately $1.5 million for fiscal 2009. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately $1.4 million for fiscal 2009. For its year-end pension obligation determination, the Company selected a discount rate of 6.6% and 5.75% for fiscal year 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Another significant assumption used to account for the Companys pension plans is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In developing the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense, the Company considers long-term historical returns (arithmetic average) of the plans investments, the asset allocation among types of investments, estimated long-term returns by investment type from external sources, and the current economic environment. Based on this information, the Company selected 7.75% for the long-term rate of return on plan assets for determining its fiscal 2008 pension expense. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the Companys expected long-term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2008 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for the Companys pension plans by approximately $5 million. The Company selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% to be used to determine its pension expense for fiscal 2009. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the Companys expected long-term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for the Companys pension plans by approximately $5 million.
When calculating expected return on plan assets for pension plans, the Company uses a market-related value of assets that spreads asset gains and losses (differences between actual return and expected return) over five years. The market-related value of assets used in the calculation of expected return on plan assets for fiscal 2008 was $257 million lower than the actual fair value of plan assets.
The rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans. The Company determines this assumption based on its long-term plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions. Based on this information, the Company selected 4.25% for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 as the rate of compensation increase for determining its year-end pension obligation. The Company selected 4.25% for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006. A 25 basis point increase in the Companys rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2008 would increase pension expense for the Companys pension plans by approximately $2 million for the year. A 25 basis point decrease in the Companys rate of compensation increase assumption as of the 36 Table of Contents beginning of fiscal 2008 would decrease pension expense for the Companys pension plans by approximately $2 million for the year. The Company selected a rate of 4.25% for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine its pension expense for fiscal 2009. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the Companys rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would increase/decrease pension expense for the Companys pension plans by approximately $1 million for the year.
The Company also provides certain postretirement health care benefits. The Company recognized postretirement benefit expense of $23 million, $10 million, and $18 million in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The Company reflects liabilities of $378 million and $392 million in its balance sheets as of May25, 2008 and May27, 2007, respectively. The postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on the Companys assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts. These assumptions include discount rates (discussed above), health care cost trend rates, inflation rates, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. The health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. Assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The discount rate selected by the Company for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006 was 5.5%. The Company has selected a discount rate of 6.4% for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2009. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the Companys discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would decrease/increase postretirement expense for the Companys plans by approximately $1 million. The Company has assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 9.5%, with the trend rate decreasing to 5.5% by 2013. A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effect: ($ in millions) OnePercent Increase OnePercent Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost $ 1.7 $ (1.6 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation 25.9 (22.6 ) The Company provides workers compensation benefits to its employees. The measurement of the liability for the Companys cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs. One significant assumption made by the Company is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of its obligation. The discount rate used at May25, 2008 was 5.0%. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers compensation expense.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (including property, plant and equipment), Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets The Company reduces the carrying amounts of long-lived assets, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts (i.e., assets are deemed to be impaired). Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires the Company to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset(s) being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, the Company considers historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by the Company in such areas as future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions, product pricing and necessary capital expenditures. The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts (or none at all) for long-lived assets, goodwill, and identifiable intangible assets.
The Company utilizes a relief from royalty methodology in evaluating impairment of its brands/trademarks. The methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate the Company would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand. As the calculated fair value of the Companys goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets significantly exceeds the carrying amount of these assets, a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the Companys goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets would not result in a material impairment charge.
37 Table of Contents RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging ActivitiesAn Amendment of FASB Statement No.133 . This standard requires enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No.133 and its related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This statement is effective for the Companys third quarter of fiscal 2009.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of ARB No.51 . This statement amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest (minority interest) in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Upon its adoption, effective as of the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2010, noncontrolling interests will be classified as equity in the Companys financial statements and income and comprehensive income attributed to the noncontrolling interest will be included in the Companys income and comprehensive income. The provisions of this standard must be applied retrospectively upon adoption. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No.160 on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No.141(R)). SFAS No.141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. The provisions of SFAS No.141(R) are effective for the Companys business combinations occurring on or after June1, 2009.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . SFAS No.159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. This provides entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without being required to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. The provisions of SFAS No.159 are effective as of the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2009. Management does not expect the adoption of SFAS No.159 to have any impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.157, Fair Value Measurements , which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No.157 are effective as of the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2009 for the Companys financial assets and liabilities, as well as for any other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in its consolidated financial statements. The FASB has provided for a one-year deferral of the implementation of this standard for other nonfinanical assets and liabilities. Management does not expect the adoption of SFAS No.157 to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Sales to affiliates (equity method investees) of $4.2 million, $3.8 million, and $2.9 million for fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, are included in net sales. The Company received management fees from affiliates of $16.3 million, $14.8 million, and $13.5 million in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Accounts receivable from affiliates totaled $3.2 million and $2.5 million at May25, 2008 and May27, 2007, respectively, of which $3.0 million and $2.1 million are included in current assets held for sale, respectively.

38 Table of Contents The Company leases various buildings that are beneficially owned by Opus Corporation or entities related to Opus Corporation (the Opus Entities). The Opus Entities are affiliates or part of a large, national real estate development company. A former member of the Companys Board of Directors, who left the board in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, is a beneficial owner, officer and chairman of Opus Corporation and a director or officer of the related entities. The agreements relate to the leasing of land, buildings, and equipment for the Company in Omaha, Nebraska. The Company occupies the buildings pursuant to long term leases with Opus Corporation and other investors, and the leases contain various termination rights and purchase options. The Company made rental payments of $13.5 million, $14.4 million, and $15.8 million in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, to the Opus Entities. The Company has also contracted with the Opus Entities for construction and property management services.

39 Table of Contents ITEM7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The principal market risks affecting the Company during fiscal 2008 and 2007 were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs, interest rates, and foreign currencies. These fluctuations impacted raw material and energy costs of all reporting segments, as well as the Companys trading and merchandising activities, which are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the Companys financial statements.
Commodities The Company purchases commodity inputs such as wheat, corn, oats, soybean meal, soybean oil, meat, dairy products, sugar, natural gas, electricity, and packaging materials to be used in its operations. These commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create gross margin risk. The Company enters into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments. The Company has policies governing the hedging instruments its businesses may use. These policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of its businesses. The Company also monitors the amount of associated counter-party credit risk for all non-exchange-traded transactions. In addition, the Company, during fiscal 2008 and 2007, purchased and sold certain commodities, such as wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, oats, natural gas, and crude oil in its trading and merchandising business (presented in discontinued operations). To a lesser extent, the Company engages in wheat trading activities in its milling operations of the Food and Ingredients reporting segment. The Companys trading activities are limited in terms of maximum dollar exposure, as measured by a dollar-at-risk methodology and monitored to ensure compliance.
The following table presents one measure of market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis is the measurement of potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in market prices. Actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes. In practice, as markets move, the Company actively manages its risk and adjusts hedging strategies as appropriate. Fair value was determined using quoted market prices and was based on the Companys net derivative position by commodity at each quarter-end during the fiscal year. The market risk exposure analysis excludes the underlying commodity positions that are being hedged. The values of commodities hedged have a high inverse correlation to price changes of the derivative commodity instrument.

At the end of fiscal 2008 and 2007, the Company did not have any interest rate swap agreements outstanding.
As of May25, 2008 and May27, 2007, the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt was estimated at $3.7 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, based on current market rates primarily provided by outside investment advisors. As of May25, 2008 and May27, 2007, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt by approximately $228 million and $253 million, respectively, while a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt by approximately $258 million and $288 million, respectively.
Foreign Operations In order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of its processing and trading operations. This activity primarily relates to hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory, capital equipment, sales of finished goods, and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
The following table presents one measure of market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis for the Companys processing and trading operations. Sensitivity analysis is the measurement of potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in exchange rates. Actual changes in exchange rates may differ from hypothetical changes. Fair value was determined using quoted exchange rates and was based on the Companys net foreign currency position at each quarter-end during the fiscal year. The market risk exposure analysis excludes the underlying foreign denominated transactions that are being hedged. The currencies hedged have a high inverse correlation to exchange rate changes of the foreign currency derivative instrument.

46 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Fiscal years ended May25, 2008,May27, 2007, and May28, 2006 Columnar Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Fiscal Year The fiscal year of ConAgra Foods, Inc. (ConAgra Foods or the Company) ends the last Sunday in May. The fiscal years for the consolidated financial statements presented consist of 52-week periods for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006.
Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ConAgra Foods and all majority-owned subsidiaries. In addition, the accounts of all variable interest entities for which the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary are included in the Companys consolidated financial statements from the date such determination is made. All significant intercompany investments, accounts, and transactions have been eliminated.
Variable Interest Entities The Company consolidates the assets and liabilities of several entities from which it leases corporate aircraft. For periods ending prior to September 2007, the Company consolidated several entities from which it leases office buildings. Each of these entities had been determined to be a variable interest entity and the Company was determined to be the primary beneficiary of each of these entities. In September 2007, the Company ceased to be the primary beneficiary of the entities from which it leases office buildings and, accordingly, the Company discontinued the consolidation of the assets and liabilities of these entities.
Due to the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Company reflects in its balance sheets: May25, 2008 May27, 2007 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 51.8 $ 155.9 Other assets  13.8 Current installments of long-term debt 3.3 6.1 Senior long-term debt, excluding current installments 50.9 144.1 Other accrued liabilities 0.6 0.6 Other noncurrent liabilities  21.9 The liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating these entities do not represent additional claims on the general assets of the Company. The creditors of these entities have claims only on the assets of the specific variable interest entities to which they have advanced credit.
Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates The investments in and the operating results of 50%-or-less-owned entities not required to be consolidated are included in the consolidated financial statements on the basis of the equity method of accounting or the cost method of accounting, depending on specific facts and circumstances.
The Company reviews its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investments may not be fully recoverable. Evidence of a loss in value that is other than temporary might include the absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment, the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity which would justify the carrying amount of the investment, or, where applicable, estimated sales proceeds which are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the investment. Managements assessment as to whether any decline in value is other than temporary is based on the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment and whether evidence indicating the carrying value of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary. Management generally considers the Companys investments in its 47 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Fiscal years ended May25, 2008,May27, 2007, and May28, 2006 Columnar Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts equity method investees to be strategic long-term investments. Therefore, management completes its assessments with a long-term viewpoint. If the fair value of the investment is determined to be less than the carrying value and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an appropriate write-down is recorded based on the excess of the carrying value over the best estimate of fair value of the investment.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition, including short-term time deposits and government agency and corporate obligations, are classified as cash and cash equivalents.
Inventories The Company principally uses the lower of cost (determined using the first-in, first-out method) or market for valuing inventories other than merchandisable agricultural commodities. Grain, flour, and major feed ingredient inventories are principally stated at market value.
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation has been calculated using primarily the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective classes of assets as follows: Land improvements 1-40years Buildings 15-40years Machinery and equipment 3-20 years Furniture, fixtures, office equipment, and other 5-15 years The Company reviews property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability of an asset considered held-and-used is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the asset. If the carrying amount is greater than the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, the assets carrying amount is reduced to its estimated fair value. An asset considered held-for-sale is reported at the lower of the assets carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets Goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives (e.g., brands or trademarks) are not amortized and are tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired. Impairment of identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives occurs when the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. If impaired, the assets carrying amount is reduced to its fair value. Goodwill is evaluated using a two-step impairment test at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit can be an operating segment or a business within an operating segment. The first step of the test compares the recorded value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, with its fair value, as determined by its estimated discounted cash flows. If the recorded value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company completes the second step of the test to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized. In the second step, the Company estimates an implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets). The impairment loss is equal to the excess of the recorded value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The Companys annual impairment testing is performed during the fourth quarter using a discounted cash flow-based methodology.
Identifiable intangible assets with definite lives (e.g., licensing arrangements with contractual lives or customer relationships) are amortized over their estimated useful lives and tested for impairment whenever 48 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Fiscal years ended May25, 2008,May27, 2007, and May28, 2006 Columnar Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired. Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used in evaluating elements of property, plant and equipment. If impaired, the asset is written down to its fair value.
Fair Values of Financial Instruments Unless otherwise specified, the Company believes the carrying value of financial instruments approximates their fair value.
Environmental Liabilities Environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated. The Company uses third-party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with environmental liabilities. Such liabilities are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change. The Company does not discount its environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable. Managements estimate of its potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements. The Company has not reduced its environmental liabilities for potential insurance recoveries.
Employment-Related Benefits Employment-related benefits associated with pensions, postretirement health care benefits, and workers compensation are expensed as such obligations are incurred by the Company. The recognition of expense is impacted by estimates made by management, such as discount rates used to value these liabilities, future health care costs, and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported. The Company uses third-party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with employment-related benefits.
Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss are transferred to customers upon delivery based on terms of sale and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received after deducting estimated amounts for discounts, trade allowances, and returns of damaged and out-of-date products. Changes in the market value of inventories of merchandisable agricultural commodities, forward cash purchase and sales contracts, and exchange-traded futures and options contracts are recognized in earnings immediately.
Shipping and Handling Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are included in net sales. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold.
Marketing Costs The Company promotes its products with advertising, consumer incentives, and trade promotions. Such programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, and volume-based incentives. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Consumer incentives and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction of revenue or as a component of cost of goods sold based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of the period, based principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. Advertising and promotion expenses totaled $393.3 million, $451.6 million, and $334.0 million in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.
Research and Development The Company incurred expenses of $68.9 million, $68.3 million, and $54.1 million for research and development activities in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.
Comprehensive Income  Comprehensive income includes net income, currency translation adjustments, certain derivative-related activity, changes in the value of available-for-sale investments, and changes in prior service cost and net actuarial gains/losses from pension and postretirement health care plans. The Company 49 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Fiscal years ended May25, 2008,May27, 2007, and May28, 2006 Columnar Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts generally deems its foreign investments to be essentially permanent in nature and it does not provide for taxes on currency translation adjustments arising from converting the investment in a foreign currency to U.S. dollars. When the Company determines that a foreign investment is no longer permanent in nature, estimated taxes are provided for the related deferred taxes, if any, resulting from currency translation adjustments. The Company reclassified $21.7 million and $0.2 million of foreign currency translation gains to net income due to the disposal of foreign subsidiaries and equity method investments in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively.

These estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses as reflected in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Accounting Changes As further discussed in Note 18, the Company elected to adopt the measurement date provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans , as of May28, 2007 (the first day of fiscal 2008).
As further discussed in Note 14, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (as amended) , as of May28, 2007 (the first day of fiscal 2008). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This Interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.
50 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Fiscal years ended May25, 2008,May27, 2007, and May28, 2006 Columnar Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts As further discussed in Note 13, the Company adopted SFAS No.123R, Share-Based Payment , effective May29, 2006 (the first day of fiscal 2007).
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No.161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging ActivitiesAn Amendment of FASB Statement No.133 . This standard requires enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No.133 and its related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This statement is effective for the Companys third quarter of fiscal 2009.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of ARB No.51 . This statement amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest (minority interest) in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Upon its adoption, effective as of the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2010, noncontrolling interests will be classified as equity in the Companys financial statements and income and comprehensive income attributed to the noncontrolling interest will be included in the Companys income and comprehensive income. The provisions of this standard must be applied retrospectively upon adoption. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No.160 on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No.141(R)). SFAS No.141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. The provisions of SFAS No.141(R) are effective for the Companys business combinations occurring on or after June1, 2009.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . SFAS No.159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. This provides entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without being required to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. The provisions of SFAS No.159 are effective as of the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2009. Management does not expect the adoption of SFAS No.159 to have any impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.157, Fair Value Measurements , which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No.157 are effective as of the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2009 for the Companys financial assets and liabilities, as well as for any other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in its consolidated financial statements. The FASB has provided for a one-year deferral of the implementation of this standard for other nonfinancial assets and liabilities. Management does not expect the adoption of SFAS No.157 to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.
2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND DIVESTITURES Trading and Merchandising Operations On March27, 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with affiliates of Ospraie Special Opportunities Fund (the Ospraie Investors) to sell its commodity trading and merchandising operations conducted by 51 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Fiscal years ended May25, 2008,May27, 2007, and May28, 2006 Columnar Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts ConAgra Trade Group and principally reported as the Trading and Merchandising segment. The operations include the domestic and international grain merchandising, fertilizer distribution, agricultural and energy commodities trading and services, and grain, animal, and oil seed byproducts merchandising and distribution business.

5. EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated on the basis of weighted average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of basic weighted average outstanding common shares adjusted for the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock awards, and other dilutive securities.
The following table reconciles the income and average share amounts used to compute both basic and diluted earnings per share: 2008 2007 2006 Net Income: Income from continuing operations $ 518.7 $ 482.3 $ 463.6 Income from discontinued operations 411.9 282.3 70.2 Net income $ 930.6 $ 764.6 $ 533.8 Weighted Average Shares Outstanding: Basic weighted average shares outstanding 487.5 504.2 518.1 Add: Dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock awards, and other dilutive securities 3.4 2.9 2.1 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 490.9 507.1 520.2 At the end of fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, there were 16.1million, 14.9million, and 20.9million stock options outstanding, respectively, that were excluded from the computation of shares contingently issuable upon exercise of the stock options because exercise prices exceeded the annual average market value of the Companys common stock.
6. RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES 2006-2008 Restructuring Plan In February 2006, the Companys board of directors approved a plan recommended by executive management to simplify the Companys operating structure and reduce its manufacturing and selling, general, and administrative costs (2006-2008 plan). The plan included supply chain rationalization initiatives, the relocation of the Grocery Foods headquarters from Irvine, California to Naperville, Illinois, the centralization of shared services, salaried headcount reductions, and other cost-reduction initiatives. The plan was substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2008. The forecasted cost of the plan, as updated through May25, 2008, is $232.8 56 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Fiscal years ended May25, 2008,May27, 2007, and May28, 2006 Columnar Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts million, of which a benefit of $1.6 million was recorded in fiscal 2008, $103.0 million of expense was recorded in fiscal 2007, and $129.6 million of expense was recorded in the second half of fiscal 2006. The Company has recorded expenses associated with this restructuring plan, including but not limited to, asset impairment charges, accelerated depreciation (i.e., incremental depreciation due to an assets reduced estimated useful life), inventory write-downs, severance and related costs, and plan implementation costs (e.g., consulting, employee relocation, etc.).
Included in the above estimates are $133.4 million of charges which have resulted or will result in cash outflows and $99.4 million of non-cash charges.
During fiscal 2008, the Company reassessed certain aspects of its plan to rationalize its supply chain. The Company determined that it will continue to operate three production facilities that it had previously planned to close. As a result of such determination, previously established reserves, primarily for related severance costs and pension costs, were reversed in fiscal 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the best use of a new production facility, the construction of which is in progress, in connection with its restructuring plans. The Company, based on its current assessment of likely scenarios, believes the carrying value of this facility ($41.1 million at May25, 2008) is recoverable. In the event the Company determines that the future use of the new facility will not result in recovery of the recorded value of the asset, an impairment charge would be required.
The Company recognized the following cumulative (plan inception to May25, 2008) pre-tax charges (recoveries) related to the 2006-2008 plan in its consolidated statements of earnings: Consumer Foods Food and Ingredients International Foods Corporate Total Accelerated depreciation $ 62.7 $  $  $  $ 62.7 Inventory write-downs 5.9 0.2   6.1 Severance and related costs  1.1   1.1 Other (including plan shutdown costs) (1.9 )    (1.9 ) Total cost of goods sold 66.7 1.3   68.0 Accelerated depreciation 5.7   0.4 6.1 Asset impairment 24.9 1.6   26.5 Severance and related costs 27.6 3.1 0.7 22.7 54.1 Contract termination 18.2   1.1 19.3 Pension/Postretirement  0.1  4.2 4.3 Plan implementation costs 27.7 0.2  28.3 56.2 Other, net (2.2 ) (1.3 )   (3.5 ) Total selling, general and administrative expenses 101.9 3.7 0.7 56.7 163.0 Consolidated total $ 168.6 $ 5.0 $ 0.7 $ 56.7 $ 231.0 Included in the above are $131.6 million of charges which have resulted or will result in cash outflows and $99.4 million of non-cash charges.

This plan includes the reorganization of the Consumer Foods operations, the integration of the international headquarters functions into the Companys domestic business, and exiting a number of international markets. These plans are expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2009. The forecasted costs of this plan, as updated through May25, 2008, are $43.5 million, of which $27.8 million was recorded in fiscal 2008. The Company has recorded expenses associated with this restructuring plan, including but not limited to, inventory write-downs, severance and related costs, and plan implementation costs (e.g., consulting, employee relocation, etc.). The Company anticipates it will recognize the following pre-tax expenses associated with the 2008-2009 plan in the fiscal 2008 to 2009 timeframe (amounts include charges recognized in fiscal 2008): Consumer Foods International Foods Corporate Total Inventory write-downs $  $ 2.6 $  $ 2.6 Total cost of goods sold  2.6  2.6 Asset impairment  0.8  0.8 Severance and related costs 7.9 11.0 3.4 22.3 Contract termination  5.8  5.8 Plan implementation costs  0.7 4.1 4.8 Goodwill/Brand impairment  0.2  0.2 Other, net  7.0  7.0 Total selling, general and administrative expenses 7.9 25.5 7.5 40.9 Consolidated total $ 7.9 $ 28.1 $ 7.5 $ 43.5 Included in the above estimates are $34.0 million of charges which have resulted or will result in cash outflows and $9.5 million of non-cash charges.

IMPAIRMENT OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES During fiscal 2006, the Company recognized impairment charges totaling $75.8 million ($73.1 million after tax) of its investments in a malt venture and an unrelated investment in a foreign prepared foods business, due to declines in the estimated proceeds from the disposition of these investments. The investment in a foreign prepared foods business was disposed of in fiscal 2006. The extent of the impairments was determined based upon the Companys assessment of the recoverability of its investments based primarily upon the expected proceeds of planned dispositions of the investments.
During fiscal 2007, the Company completed the disposition of the equity method investment in the malt venture for proceeds of approximately $24 million, including notes and other receivables totaling approximately $7 million. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $4 million, with a related tax benefit of approximately $4 million. These charges and the subsequent gain on disposition are reflected in equity method investment earnings in the consolidated statements of earnings.
During fiscal 2006, the Company determined that the fair value of subordinated notes, with an original principal amount of $150 million plus accrued interest of $50.4 million from Swift Foods, were impaired and that the impairment was other-than-temporary. Accordingly, the Company reduced the carrying value of the notes to approximately $117 million and recognized impairment charges totaling $82.9 million in selling, general and 59 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Fiscal years ended May25, 2008,May27, 2007, and May28, 2006 Columnar Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts administrative expenses, including the reclassification of the cumulative after-tax charges of $21.9 million from accumulated other comprehensive income. During fiscal 2007, the Company closed on the sale of these notes for approximately $117 million, net of transaction expenses, resulting in no additional gain or loss.
8. INVENTORIES The major classes of inventories are as follows: 2008 2007 Raw materials and packaging $ 580.8 $ 458.5 Work in progress 100.0 94.6 Finished goods 1,179.1 1,001.3 Supplies and other 71.6 70.7 Total $ 1,931.5 $ 1,625.1 9. CREDIT FACILITIES AND BORROWINGS At May25, 2008, the Company had credit lines from banks that totaled approximately $2.3 billion. These lines are comprised of a $1.5 billion multi-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions which matures in December 2011, uncommitted short-term loan facilities approximating $364 million, and uncommitted trade finance facilities approximating $424 million. Borrowings under the multi-year facility bear interest at or below prime rate and may be prepaid without penalty. The Company has not drawn upon this multi-year facility.
The uncommitted trade finance facilities mentioned above were maintained in order to finance certain working capital needs of the Companys trading and merchandising operations. Subsequent to the sale of this business in June 2008, the Company exited these facilities.
The Company finances its short-term liquidity needs with bank borrowings, commercial paper borrowings, and bankers acceptances. As of May25, 2008, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $578.3 million, primarily under the commercial paper arrangements. The weighted average interest rate on these borrowings as of May25, 2008 was 2.76%. The average consolidated short-term borrowings outstanding under these facilities were $418.5 million and $4.3 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating these entities do not represent additional claims on the general assets of the Company. The creditors of these entities have claims only on the assets of the specific variable interest entities to which they extend credit.
For periods ending prior to November25, 2007, the Company consolidated several entities from which it leases office buildings. These entities were determined to be variable interest entities, and the Company was determined to be the primary beneficiary of each of these entities. In September 2007, the Company ceased to be the primary beneficiary of the entities from which it leases office buildings and, accordingly, the Company discontinued the consolidation of the assets and liabilities of these entities. This resulted in reducing the amount of long-term debt reflected in the Companys balance sheet by $83 million. However, a lease agreement with one of the variable interest entities was determined to be a capital lease, and, as such, at May25, 2008 the Company reflected the related leased assets of $46 million in property, plant and equipment, capital lease obligations of $44 million in senior long-term debt, and $2 million in current installments of long-term debt.
61 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Fiscal years ended May25, 2008,May27, 2007, and May28, 2006 Columnar Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts In December 2006, the Company completed an exchange of approximately $200 million principal amount of its 9.75% subordinated notes due March 2021 and approximately $300 million principal amount of its 6.75% senior notes due September 2011 for approximately $500 million principal amount of 5.819% senior notes due June 2017 and cash of approximately $90 million, in order to improve the Companys debt maturity profile. The Company is amortizing the $90 million cash payment over the life of the new notes within interest expense.
The Companys most restrictive note agreements (the revolving credit facilities and certain privately placed long-term debt) require the Company to repay the debt if consolidated funded debt exceeds 65% of the consolidated capital base, as defined, or if fixed charges coverage, as defined, is less than 1.75 to 1.0, as such terms are defined in applicable agreements. At May25, 2008, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants.
Net interest expense consists of: 2008 2007 2006 Long-term debt $ 255.9 $ 263.5 $ 311.5 Short-term debt 14.7 0.4 3.8 Interest income (9.1 ) (37.3 ) (38.8 ) Interest capitalized (8.2 ) (7.1 ) (5.0 ) $ 253.3 $ 219.5 $ 271.5 Net interest paid from continuing and discontinued operations was $254.5 million, $228.2 million, and $304.9 million in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.
The Companys net interest expense was reduced by $1.2 million, $3.6 million, and $11.5 million in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, due to the net impact of previously closed interest rate swap agreements.
The carrying amount of long-term debt (including current installments) was $3.4 billion as of May25, 2008 and May27, 2007. Based on current market rates provided primarily by outside investment bankers, the fair value of this debt at May25, 2008 and May27, 2007 was estimated at $3.7 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively.
As part of the Watts Brothers purchase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company assumed $83.8 million of debt, of which the Company immediately repaid $64.3 million after the acquisition.
During fiscal 2006, the Company redeemed $500 million of 6% senior debt due in September 2006 and $250 million of 7.875% senior debt due in September 2010. These early retirements of debt resulted in pre-tax losses of $30.3 million (including $26.3 million recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006), which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

See Note 22 for further discussion of the share repurchase authorization subsequent to fiscal 2008 year end.
13. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS In accordance with stockholder-approved plans, the Company issues share-based payments under various stock-based compensation arrangements, including stock options, restricted stock, performance shares, and other share-based awards.
On September28, 2006, the stockholders approved the ConAgra Foods 2006 Stock Plan, which authorizes the issuance of up to 30million shares of ConAgra Foods common stock. At May25, 2008, approximately 19.6million shares were reserved for granting additional options, restricted stock, bonus stock awards, or other share-based awards.
Stock Option Plan The Company has stockholder-approved stock option plans which provide for granting of options to employees for the purchase of common stock at prices equal to the fair value at the date of grant. Options become exercisable under various vesting schedules (typically three to five years) and generally expire seven to ten years after the date of grant.
63 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Fiscal years ended May25, 2008,May27, 2007, and May28, 2006 Columnar Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for stock options granted: 2008 2007 2006 Expected volatility (%) 17.45 19.46 26.80 Dividend yield (%) 3.00 3.26 4.05 Risk-free interest rates (%) 4.58 5.02 3.84 Expected life of stock option (years) 4.75 4.64 6.00 The expected volatility is based on the historical market volatility of the Companys stock over the expected life of the stock options granted. The expected life represents the period of time that the awards are expected to be outstanding and is based on the contractual term of each instrument, taking into account employees historical exercise and termination behavior.
A summary of the option activity as of May25, 2008, and changes during the fifty-two weeks then ended is presented below: Fiscal 2008 Options Number ofOptions (inMillions) Weighted Average Exercise Price Average Remaining Contractual Term (Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in Millions) Outstanding at May28, 2007 26.8 $ 23.84 Granted 8.3 $ 26.27 Exercised (1.8 ) $ 22.44 $ 4.8 Forfeited (1.0 ) $ 24.40 Expired (1.6 ) $ 31.62 Outstanding at May25, 2008 30.7 $ 24.16 5.29 $ 20.0 Exercisable at May25, 2008 23.2 $ 23.94 4.99 $ 17.1 The Company recognizes compensation expense using the straight-line method over the requisite service period. During fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, the Company granted 8.3million options, 6.7million options, and 8.0million options, respectively, with a weighted average grant date value of $4.23, $3.92, and $4.52, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $4.8 million, $7.6 million, and $2.9 million for fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The closing market price of the Companys common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2008 was $23.38 per share.
Compensation expense and the related tax benefit for stock option awards totaled $26.7 million and $9.7 million, respectively, for fiscal 2008. Compensation expense and the related tax benefit for stock option awards totaled $21.4 million and $7.7 million, respectively, for fiscal 2007. No compensation expense was recognized in fiscal 2006 related to options as past awards (pre-SFAS No.123R adoption) were accounted for under APB No.25.
At May25, 2008, the Company had $28.7 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock options that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.4 years.
Cash received from option exercises for the fiscal years ended May25, 2008 and May27, 2007 was $37.5 million and $63.8 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercises totaled $1.8 million and $2.8 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively.
64 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Fiscal years ended May25, 2008,May27, 2007, and May28, 2006 Columnar Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts Share Unit Plans In accordance with stockholder-approved plans, the Company issues stock under various stock-based compensation arrangements, including restricted stock, restricted share equivalents, and other share-based awards (share units). These awards generally have requisite service periods of three to five years. Under each arrangement, stock is issued without direct cost to the employee. The Company estimates the fair value of the share units based upon the market price of the Companys stock at the date of grant. Certain share unit grants do not provide for the payment of dividend equivalents to the participant during the requisite service period (vesting period). For those grants, the value of the grants is reduced by the net present value of the foregone dividend equivalent payments. The Company recognizes compensation expense for share unit awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The compensation expense for the Companys share unit awards totaled $16.7 million, $10.4 million, and $23.8 million for fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The tax benefit related to the compensation expense for fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $6.1 million, $3.8 million, and $8.7 million, respectively.
The following table summarizes the nonvested share units as of May25, 2008, and changes during the fifty-two weeks then ended: Share Units ShareUnits (inMillions) Weighted Average Grant-Date FairValue Nonvested share units at May 28, 2007 2.14 $ 23.64 Granted 1.41 $ 25.28 Vested/Issued (0.72 ) $ 23.44 Forfeited (0.16 ) $ 24.88 Nonvested share units at May 25, 2008 2.67 $ 24.91 During fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, the Company granted 1.4million share units, 0.8million share units, and 0.7million share units, respectively, with a weighted average grant date value of $25.28, $22.75, and $22.74, respectively.
The total intrinsic value of share units vested during fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $16.9 million, $13.9 million, and $17.5 million, respectively.
At May25, 2008, the Company had $33.2 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to share unit awards that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.1 years.
Performance Based Share Plan Under its 2007 Performance Share Plan, adopted pursuant to stockholder-approved incentive plans, the Company granted selected executives and other key employees performance share awards with vesting contingent upon the Company meeting various Company-wide performance goals. The performance goals are based upon Company earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and Company return on average invested capital (ROAIC) measured over the fiscal 2007 to 2009 performance period. The awards actually earned will range from zero to three hundred percent of the targeted number of performance shares and be paid in shares of common stock. Generally, for the three-year performance period beginning with fiscal year 2007, up to one-third of the 65 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Fiscal years ended May25, 2008,May27, 2007, and May28, 2006 Columnar Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts targeted performance shares were earned in fiscal year 2007 based upon Company performance for fiscal year 2007; up to one-third of the targeted performance shares were earned in fiscal year 2008 based upon Company performance for the entire performance period, representing cumulative performance in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008; and the balance of the targeted performance shares, and any above target payout, may be earned based upon cumulative performance for the entire performance period, which concludes at the end of fiscal year 2009. Based on the attainment of various interim Company-wide performance goals, the Company issued one-third of the targeted performance shares granted under the 2007 performance share plan in July 2007 to those participants who were eligible for an interim payout and will issue one-third of the targeted number of performance shares granted under the 2007 performance share plan in July 2008 to those participants who are eligible for an interim payout.
Under its 2008 Performance Share Plan, adopted pursuant to stockholder-approved incentive plans, the Company granted selected executives and other key employees performance share awards with vesting contingent upon the Company meeting various Company-wide performance goals. The performance goals are based upon Company earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and Company return on average invested capital (ROAIC) measured over the fiscal 2008 to 2010 performance period. The awards actually earned will range from zero to three hundred percent of the targeted number of performance shares and be paid in shares of common stock. Subject to limited exceptions set forth in the plan, any shares earned will be distributed at the end of the three-year period.
The fair value of each grant was estimated based upon the Companys stock price on the date of grant. Management must evaluate, on a quarterly basis, the probability that the target performance goals will be met and the anticipated level of attainment in order to determine the amount of compensation cost to recognize in the financial statements. If such defined performance goals are not met, no compensation cost will be recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed. As the awards under the 2007 performance share plan contain both a service condition and performance conditions in order to vest and a certain portion of the award (tranche) may vest each fiscal year within the performance period, the Company recognizes compensation expense for these awards over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche. Awards under the 2008 performance share plan are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
A summary of the activity for performance share awards as of May25, 2008, and changes during the fifty-two weeks then ended is presented below: Performance Shares Shares (inMillions) Weighted Average Grant-Date FairValue Nonvested performance shares at May 28, 2007 1.7 $ 22.21 Granted 0.7 $ 26.61 Vested/Issued (0.6 ) $ 22.05 Forfeited (0.1 ) $ 24.06 Nonvested performance shares at May 25, 2008 1.7 $ 23.92 The compensation expense for the Companys performance share awards totaled $19.2 million and $29.8 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. The tax benefit related to the compensation expense for fiscal 2008 and 2007 was $7.0 million and $10.9 million, respectively.

Restricted Cash Plan The Company has granted restricted share equivalents pursuant to plans approved by stockholders that are ultimately settled in cash (restricted cash) based on the market price of the Companys stock as of the date the award is fully vested. The value of the restricted cash is adjusted based upon the market price of the Companys stock at the end of each reporting period and amortized as compensation expense over the vesting period (generally five years). The restricted cash awards earn dividend equivalents during the requisite service period (vesting period).
Restricted Cash Share Equivalents (inThousands) IntrinsicValue Outstanding share units at May28, 2007 963 $ 25.66 Granted   Earned Dividend Equivalents 22 $ 24.74 Vested/Issued (486 ) $ 23.61 Forfeited (18 ) $ 24.49 Outstanding share units at May25, 2008 481 $ 23.38 The compensation expense for the Companys restricted cash awards totaled $1.2 million, $5.8 million, and $12.5 million for fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006 respectively, while the tax benefit related to the compensation expense for the same periods was $0.4 million, $2.1 million, and $4.6 million, respectively. The total payments for share-based liabilities during fiscal 2008 and 2007 were $11.5 million and $4.1 million, respectively.
The following table illustrates the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share assuming the Company had followed the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation , for all outstanding and unvested stock options for the fifty-two weeks ended May28, 2006.

SFAS No.123R requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow. This requirement has reduced net operating cash flows and increased net financing cash flows by approximately $1.8 million for fiscal 2008.
14. PRE-TAX INCOME AND INCOME TAXES Pre-tax income from continuing operations (including equity method investment earnings (loss)) consisted of the following: 2008 2007 2006 United States $ 676.3 $ 681.2 $ 649.8 Foreign 69.6 46.6 48.8 $ 745.9 $ 727.8 $ 698.6 The provision for income taxes included the following: 2008 2007 2006 Current Federal $ 199.0 $ 256.9 $ 235.9 State (6.0 ) 8.8 15.4 Foreign 18.0 12.9 17.1 211.0 278.6 268.4 Deferred Federal 26.2 (20.2 ) 4.7 State (9.6 ) (5.8 ) (20.8 ) Foreign (0.4 ) (7.1 ) (17.3 ) 16.2 (33.1 ) (33.4 ) $ 227.2 $ 245.5 $ 235.0 Income taxes computed by applying the U.S. Federal statutory rates to income from continuing operations before income taxes are reconciled to the provision for income taxes set forth in the consolidated statements of earnings as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Computed U.S. Federal income taxes $ 261.0 $ 254.7 $ 244.5 State income taxes, net of U.S. Federal tax impact (10.1 ) 1.9 (3.5 ) Export, tax credits, and domestic manufacturing deduction (18.6 ) (10.5 ) (9.1 ) Foreign tax credits (30.7 ) (0.5 ) (8.5 ) Tax impact of equity method investment divestiture  (5.0 ) 27.6 IRS audit adjustments and settlement (0.7 ) 20.5  Other 26.3 (15.6 ) (16.0 ) $ 227.2 $ 245.5 $ 235.0 68 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Fiscal years ended May25, 2008,May27, 2007, and May28, 2006 Columnar Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts Fiscal 2008 state income taxes benefit includes state income tax expense on taxable income which was more than offset by certain tax benefits, principally related to the resolution of various state tax audits, a change in legal entity structure, and state tax credits. Fiscal 2006 state income taxes benefit includes state income tax expense on taxable income which was more than offset by certain tax benefits, principally related to a change in state deferred tax rates and changes in estimates.
Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $471.3 million, $436.1 million, and $340.0 million in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.
The tax effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following: 2008 2007 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Property, plant and equipment $  $ 305.3 $  $ 291.0 Goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets  454.3  399.8 Accrued expenses 43.5  40.0  Compensation related liabilities 52.9  64.7  Pension and other postretirement benefits 84.9  198.4  Other liabilities that will give rise to future tax deductions 124.4  131.2  Long-term debt  15.7  33.7 Foreign tax credit carryforwards 9.3  15.4  State tax credit and NOL carryforwards 29.9  22.1  Other 26.1  21.4 25.4 371.0 775.3 493.2 749.9 Less: Valuation allowance (49.9 )  (48.3 )  Net deferred taxes $ 321.1 $ 775.3 $ 444.9 $ 749.9 At May25, 2008 and May27, 2007, net deferred tax assets of $146.3 million and $147.6 million, respectively, are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets. At May25, 2008 and May27, 2007, net deferred tax liabilities of $600.5 million and $452.6 million, respectively, are included in other noncurrent liabilities.
Effective May28, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognized a $1.2 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings.
The liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at May25, 2008 was $75.8 million, excluding a related liability of $21.8 million for gross interest and penalties. Included in the balance at May25, 2008 are $11.8 million of tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. Any associated interest and penalties imposed would affect the tax rate. As of May28, 2007, the Companys gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits were $54.8 million, excluding a related liability of $12.7 million for gross interest and penalties.
69 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Fiscal years ended May25, 2008,May27, 2007, and May28, 2006 Columnar Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts The net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at May25, 2008 and May28, 2007 that, if recognized, would impact the Companys effective tax rate was $46.2 million and $39.0 million, respectively. Recognition of these tax benefits would have a favorable impact on the Companys effective tax rate.
The Company accrues interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense.
The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries, states, and local jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its audit for tax years through fiscal 2004 and all resulting significant items for fiscal 2004 and prior years have been settled with the IRS. Other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business generally have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to 5 years.
The Company estimates that it is reasonably possible that the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by $20 million to $25 million over the next twelve months due to various federal, state, and foreign audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations.
The change in the unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended May25, 2008 was (in millions): 2008 Beginning balance on May28, 2007 $ 54.8 Increases from positions established during prior periods 80.8 Decreases from positions established during prior periods (69.9 ) Increases from positions established during the current period 19.1 Decreases from positions established during the current period (0.2 ) Decreases relating to settlements with taxing authorities (5.0 ) Other adjustments to liability (1.0 ) Reductions resulting from lapse of applicable statute of limitation (2.8 ) Ending balance on May25, 2008 $ 75.8 The Company has approximately $60.0 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards ($16.5 million expire between fiscal 2008 and 2022 and $43.5 million have no expiration dates).
Substantially all of the Companys foreign tax credits will expire between fiscal 2013 and 2018. State tax credits of approximately $14.8 million expire in various years ranging from fiscal 2010 to 2016.
The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the portion of the net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and other deferred tax assets it believes will more likely than not be realized. The net impact on income tax expense related to changes in the valuation allowance for fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006 were charges of $1.6 million, $0.4 million, and a benefit of $0.9 million, respectively. The current year change principally relates to increases to the valuation allowances for state and foreign net operating losses and foreign capital losses, offset by decreases related to foreign tax credits and federal audit matters.
The Company has not provided U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative earnings of non-U.S. affiliates and associated companies that have been reinvested indefinitely. Deferred taxes are provided for earnings of non- U.S. affiliates and associated companies when the Company determines that such earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested.

COMMITMENTS The Company leases certain facilities and transportation equipment under agreements that expire at various dates. Rent expense under all operating leases for continuing operations was $129.1 million, $132.9 million, and $151.6 million in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Rent expense under operating leases for discontinued operations was $35.8 million, $35.9 million, and $41.7 million in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.
A summary of noncancelable operating lease commitments for fiscal years following May25, 2008, was as follows: 2009 $ 89.2 2010 80.0 2011 68.1 2012 58.9 2013 48.0 Later years 170.7 $ 514.9 The Company had performance bonds and other commitments and guarantees outstanding at May25, 2008, aggregating to $56.3 million. This amount includes approximately $23 million in guarantees and other commitments the Company has made on behalf of the divested fresh beef and pork business.
16. CONTINGENCIES In fiscal 1991, the Company acquired Beatrice Company (Beatrice). As a result of the acquisition and the significant pre-acquisition contingencies of the Beatrice businesses and its former subsidiaries, the consolidated post-acquisition financial statements of the Company reflect liabilities associated with the estimated resolution of these contingencies. These include various litigation and environmental proceedings related to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to its acquisition by the Company. The litigation includes several public nuisance and personal injury suits against a number of lead paint and pigment manufacturers, including ConAgra Grocery Products and the Company as alleged successors to W. P. Fuller Co., a lead paint and pigment manufacturer owned and operated by Beatrice until 1967.Although decisions favorable to the Company have been rendered in Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Wisconsin, the Company remains a defendant in active suits in Illinois, Ohio, and California. The Illinois suit seeks class-wide relief in the form of medical monitoring for elevated levels of lead in blood. The State of Ohio and several of its municipalities seek abatement of the alleged nuisance and unspecified damages. In California, a number of cities and counties have joined in a consolidated action seeking abatement of the alleged public nuisance.
The environmental proceedings include litigation and administrative proceedings involving Beatrices status as a potentially responsible party at 36 Superfund, proposed Superfund, or state-equivalent sites; these sites involve locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of Beatrice that used or produced petroleum, pesticides, fertilizers, dyes, inks, solvents, PCBs, acids, lead, sulfur, tannery wastes, and/or other contaminants. Beatrice has paid or is in the process of paying its liability share at 34 of these sites. Reserves for these matters have been established based on the Companys best estimate of its undiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required cleanup, the known volumetric contribution of Beatrice and other potentially responsible parties, and its experience in remediating sites. The reserves for Beatrice environmental matters totaled $93.6 million as of May25, 2008, a majority of which relates to the Superfund and state equivalent sites referenced above. Expenditures for these matters are expected to continue for a period of up to 20 years.
71 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Fiscal years ended May25, 2008,May27, 2007, and May28, 2006 Columnar Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts As part of the fresh beef and pork divestiture, the Company guaranteed the performance of the divested fresh beef and pork business with respect to a hog purchase contract. The hog purchase contract requires the divested fresh beef and pork business to purchase a minimum of approximately 1.2million hogs annually through 2014. The contract stipulates minimum price commitments, based in part on market prices, and in certain circumstances also includes price adjustments based on certain inputs. The Company is also a party to various potato supply agreements. Under the terms of certain such potato supply agreements, the Company has guaranteed repayment of short-term bank loans of the potato suppliers, under certain conditions. At May25, 2008, the amount of supplier loans effectively guaranteed by the Company was approximately $26 million. The Company has not established a liability for these guarantees, as the Company has determined that the likelihood of its required performance under the guarantees is remote.
The Company is party to a number of lawsuits and claims arising out of the operation of its business, including lawsuits and claims related to the February 2007 recall of its peanut butter products. The Company believes that the ultimate resolution of these lawsuits and claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. On June28, 2007, officials from the Food and Drug Administrations Office of Criminal Investigations executed a search warrant at the Companys peanut butter manufacturing facility in Sylvester, Georgia, which had been closed since the initiation of the recall, to obtain a variety of records and information relating to plant operations. The Company is cooperating with officials in regard to the investigation.
After taking into account liabilities recorded for all of the foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Costs of legal services are recognized in earnings as services are provided.
17. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company is exposed to market risks from adverse changes in:  commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and energy,  foreign exchange rates, and  interest rates.
In the normal course of business, these risks are managed through a variety of strategies, including the use of derivatives.
Commodity futures and options contracts are used to reduce the volatility of commodity input prices on items such as natural gas, vegetable oils, proteins, dairy, grains, and electricity. Generally, the Company economically hedges a portion of its anticipated consumption of commodity inputs for periods ranging from 12 to 36 months. The Company may enter into longer-term economic hedges on particular commodities if deemed appropriate. As of May25, 2008, the Company had economically hedged certain portions of its anticipated consumption of commodity inputs through November 2010.
In order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company, when deemed prudent, enters into forward exchange or option contracts to economically hedge transactions denominated in a currency other than the applicable functional currency. This includes, but is not limited to, hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment, sales of finished goods, and future settlement of foreign-denominated assets and liabilities.
72 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Fiscal years ended May25, 2008,May27, 2007, and May28, 2006 Columnar Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts From time to time, the Company may use derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, to reduce exposures related to changes in interest rates. At the end of fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, the Company had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding.
In prior periods, the Company has designated certain derivatives as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges qualifying for hedge accounting treatment. The Company discontinued designating derivatives as cash flow hedges during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and had no qualifying fair value hedges during the periods covered by this report.
Gains and losses associated with designated cash flow hedges were deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying hedged item impacted earnings. At that time, the Company reclassified net gains and losses from cash flow hedges into the same line item of the consolidated statement of earnings as where the effects of the hedged item are recorded, typically cost of goods sold. As of May27, 2007 the deferred gain, net of tax, recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income was $4.9 million.
Hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow hedges may impact net earnings when a change in the value of a hedge does not offset the change in the value of the underlying hedged item. For fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, the ineffectiveness associated with derivatives designated as cash flow hedges from continuing operations was a loss of $1.1 million, a loss of $3.3 million, and a gain of $3.1 million, respectively. The Company recognized no gain or loss from ineffectiveness for fiscal 2008, a loss of $0.1 million in fiscal 2007, and a gain of $1.7 million in fiscal 2006 within results of discontinued operations. Depending on the nature of the hedge, ineffectiveness is recognized within cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expense, or income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax. The Company does not exclude any component of the hedging instruments gain or loss when assessing ineffectiveness.
Many of the Companys derivatives do not qualify for, and, as noted above, the Company is not currently designating any derivatives to achieve hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the market value of derivatives are recognized in current earnings within cost of goods sold, selling and general and administrative expenses, or income (loss) from discontinued operations, depending on the nature of the transaction.
In addition to using derivatives to manage risk, the Company engages in the trading of commodities and related derivatives in the normal course of business. This trading occurs primarily in the trading and merchandising business which is presented within discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Exchange-traded futures and options contracts and over-the-counter option contracts, as well as forward cash purchase contracts and forward cash sales contracts of energy and agricultural commodities are used as components of trading and merchandising strategies.
All derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. The fair value of derivative assets is recognized within prepaid expenses and other current assets, and current assets held for sale, while the fair value of derivative liabilities is recognized within other accrued liabilities and current liabilities held for sale. As of May25, 2008 and May27, 2007, the total fair value of derivative assets recognized within prepaid expenses and other current assets was $207.0 million and $60.5 million, respectively, while the amount recognized within current assets held for sale was $536.6 million and $299.5 million, respectively. As of May25, 2008 and May27, 2007, the fair value of derivatives recognized within other accrued liabilities was $55.8 million and $15.3 million, respectively while the amount recognized within current liabilities held for sale was $301.6 million and $217.9 million, respectively.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS The Company and its subsidiaries have defined benefit retirement plans (plans) for eligible salaried and hourly employees. Benefits are based on years of credited service and average compensation or stated amounts for each year of service. The Company also sponsors postretirement plans which provide certain medical and dental benefits (other benefits) to qualifying U.S. employees.
The Company historically has used February28 as its measurement date for its plans. Beginning May28, 2007, the Company elected to early adopt the measurement date provisions of SFAS No.158. These provisions require the measurement date for plan assets and liabilities to coincide with the sponsors fiscal year-end. The Company used the alternative method for adoption. As a result, the Company recorded a decrease to retained earnings of approximately $11.7 million, net of tax, and an increase to accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately $1.6 million, net of tax, representing the periodic benefit cost for the period from March1, 2007 through the Companys fiscal 2007 year-end.
On May27, 2007, the Company adopted the recognition and disclosure requirements of SFAS No.158 which requires that the Company recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of its plans as an asset or liability on its consolidated balance sheet. The funded status is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. Subsequent changes in the funded status will be recognized through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur.
The changes in benefit obligations and plan assets at May25, 2008 and February28, 2007 are presented in the following table. Due to the adoption of the measurement date provisions of SFAS No.158, the changes in benefit obligations and plan assets for fiscal 2008 include fifteen months of activity.

As a result, during the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company recognized a pre-tax curtailment gain relating to postretirement benefits totaling approximately $9.4 million. This amount has been recorded within results of discontinued operations.
The Company amortizes prior service costs and amortizable gains and losses in equal annual amounts over the average expected future period of vested service. For plans with no active participants, average life expectancy is used instead of average expected useful service.
The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) expected to be recognized as components of net expense during the next year are as follows: PensionBenefits OtherBenefits Prior service cost (benefit) $ 3.0 $ (11.5 ) Net actuarial losses 2.2 10.0 76 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Fiscal years ended May25, 2008,May27, 2007, and May28, 2006 Columnar Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts To develop the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for the pension plan, the Company considers the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class is then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
The Companys pension plan weighted-average asset allocations and the Companys target asset allocations at May25, 2008 and February28, 2007, by asset category were as follows: May25, 2008 February28, 2007 Target Allocation Equity Securities 54 % 62 % 50-80 % Debt Securities 31 % 28 % 20-30 % Real Estate 5 % 5 % 0-8 % Other 10 % 5 % 0-20 % Total 100 % 100 % The Companys investment strategy reflects the expectation that equity securities will outperform debt securities over the long term. Assets are invested in a prudent manner to maintain the security of funds while maximizing returns within the Companys Investment Policy guidelines. The strategy is implemented utilizing indexed and actively managed assets from the categories listed.
The investment goals are to provide a total return that, over the long term, increases the ratio of plan assets to liabilities subject to an acceptable level of risk. This is accomplished through diversification of assets in accordance with the Investment Policy guidelines. Investment risk is mitigated by periodic rebalancing between asset classes as necessitated by changes in market conditions within the Investment Policy guidelines.
Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the benefit obligation of the postretirement plans.

The Consumer Foods reporting segment includes branded, private label, and customized food products which are sold in various retail and foodservice channels. The products include a variety of categories (meals, entrees, condiments, sides, snacks, and desserts) across frozen, refrigerated, and 78 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Fiscal years ended May25, 2008,May27, 2007, and May28, 2006 Columnar Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts shelf-stable temperature classes.

At the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company shifted management responsibility of its handheld product operations into the Consumer Foods segment from the Food and Ingredients segment, and a portion of its international snack export business from the Consumer Foods segment to the International Foods segment. Accordingly, all prior periods have been recharacterized to reflect these changes.
In June 2008, subsequent to the Companys fiscal 2008 year end, the trading and merchandising operations were divested. The operations from this business have been included in discontinued operations. Accordingly, all prior periods have been recharacterized to reflect this change.
Intersegment sales have been recorded at amounts approximating market. Operating profit for each segment is based on net sales less all identifiable operating expenses. General corporate expense, gain on sale of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock, net interest expense, equity method investment earnings (loss), and income taxes have been excluded from segment operations.
In fiscal 2008, the Company began to centrally manage foreign currency risk on behalf of the Companys reporting segments. Foreign currency derivatives used in the Companys risk management processes are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. These derivatives are viewed by management as providing economic hedges of the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions. As such, these derivatives are recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses. The gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged affects earnings.
General corporate expenses included transition services income of $14 million for fiscal 2008 related to services provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses. Prior to fiscal 2008, the Company recognized the transition services income in Consumer Foods operating profit. Consumer Foods operating profit included transition services income of $23 million for fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2006 transition services income was immaterial.

Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Companys management, with the participation of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated any change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter covered by this report and determined that there was no change in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of ConAgra Foods is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. ConAgra Foods internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. ConAgra Foods internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of ConAgra Foods; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of ConAgra Foods are being made only in accordance with the authorization of management and directors of ConAgra Foods; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of ConAgra Foods assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluations of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of the changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
With the participation of ConAgra Foods Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management assessed the effectiveness of ConAgra Foods internal control over financial reporting as of May25, 2008. In making this assessment, management used criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of May25, 2008, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective.
The effectiveness of ConAgra Foods internal control over financial reporting as of May25, 2008 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, a copy of which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Hawaux Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer July23, 2008 85 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders ConAgra Foods, Inc.: We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of ConAgra Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of May25, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May25, 2008, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of May25, 2008 and May27, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, common stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended May25, 2008, and our report dated July23, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph regarding the Companys adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No.109 ; Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No.87, 88, 106, and 132(R) ; and SFAS No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment .
