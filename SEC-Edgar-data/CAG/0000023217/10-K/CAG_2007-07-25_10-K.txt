1 PART I ITEM 1.
BUSINESS a) General Development of Business ConAgra Foods, Inc. (ConAgra Foods or the company) is a leading packaged food company serving a wide variety of food customers. Over time, the company, which was first incorporated in 1919, has grown through acquisitions, operations and internal brand and product development. The companys more significant acquisitions have included Beatrice Company in 1990, Golden Valley Microwave Foods in 1992 and International Home Foods in 2001. In recent years, ConAgra Foods has been pursuing an acquisition and divestiture strategy to shift its focus toward its core branded and value-added food products.
Over the past few years, the company has strategically repositioned its portfolio to focus on higher-margin, branded and value added businesses because that mix is expected to better serve consumers, customers, and shareholders over the long run. Executing that strategy has involved acquiring branded operations and divesting commodity-related businesses. The acquisitions included the fiscal 2001 purchase of International Home Foods and its Chef Boyardee, Guldens, Libbys, PAM, and Louis Kemp brands. These divestitures included the companys chicken business, its U.S. and Canadian crop inputs businesses (UAP North America), a Spanish feed business, a controlling interest in its fresh beef and pork business (fresh beef and pork divestiture), its canned seafood operations, and its processed cheese operations. Subsequent to fiscal year end 2004, the company disposed of its Portuguese poultry business. The company is actively marketing the remaining international portion of its crop inputs business (UAP International) and plans to dispose of this operation during fiscal 2005.
b) Financial Information about Reporting Segments For fiscal 2004, the companys operations are classified into three reporting segments: Retail Products, Foodservice Products and Food Ingredients. The company historically aggregated its retail and foodservice operations within a Packaged Foods reporting segment. As a result of the strategic portfolio changes discussed above and management realignments in fiscal 2004, the company now reports its retail and foodservice operations as two separate reporting segments: Retail Products and Foodservice Products. For fiscal 2003 and 2002, the companys operations also include a Meat Processing reporting segment which reflects results associated with the companys fresh beef and pork operations prior to the company selling a controlling interest in the operations during fiscal 2003. The contributions of each reporting segment to net sales and operating profit, and the identifiable assets attributable to each reporting segment are set forth in note19 Business Segments and Related Information on pages 88 through 90 of the companys 2004 Annual Report to Stockholders and are incorporated herein by reference.
c) Narrative Description of Business The company competes throughout the food industry and focuses on adding value for customers who sell into the retail food, foodservice and ingredients channels.
ConAgra Foods reporting segments are described below. The ConAgra Foods companies and locations, including distribution facilities, within each reporting segment, are described in Item 2.
Retail Products The Retail Products reporting segment includes branded foods in the shelf-stable, frozen and refrigerated temperature classes which are sold in various retail channels.
Shelf-stable products include tomato products, cooking oils, popcorn, soup, puddings, meat snacks, canned beans, canned pasta, canned chili, cocoa mixes and peanut butter for retail and deli customers. Shelf-stable major brands include Hunts, Healthy Choice, Chef Boyardee, Wesson, Orville Redenbachers, PAM, Slim Jim, ACT II, 2 Peter Pan, Van Camps, Guldens, Beanee Weenee, Manwich, Hunts Snack Pack, Swiss Miss, Knotts Berry Farm, La Choy, Gebhardt, DAVID, Wolf Brand, Pemmican, Penrose and Andy Capps.
Frozen food products include dinners, pizzas, turkeys, entrees, snacks, desserts, ice cream, potato products, hand-held dough-based products and seafood for retail and deli customers. Frozen food major brands include Healthy Choice, Golden Cuisine, Banquet, Marie Callenders, Butterball, Kid Cuisine, MaMa Rosas, Rosarita, Morton, Patio, La Choy, Artel and Wolfgang Puck.
Refrigerated food products include hot dogs, bacon, ham, sausages, cold cuts, turkey products, ethnic foods, kosher products, meat alternative products (e.g., soy-based hot dogs and patties), tablespreads, egg alternatives and dessert toppings for retail and deli customers. Refrigerated food major brands include Armour, Butterball, Cooks, Decker, Eckrich, Healthy Choice, Louis Kemp, Ready Crisp, Hebrew National, Brown N Serve, Lightlife, National Deli, Parkay, Blue Bonnet, Fleischmanns, Egg Beaters and Reddi-wip.
Foodservice Products The Foodservice Products reporting segment includes branded and customized food products, including meals, entrees, prepared potatoes, meats, seafood, sauces, and a variety of custom-manufactured culinary products packaged for sale to restaurants and other foodservice establishments.
Major brands include Armour, Butterball, County Line, Cooks, Decker, Longmont, Eckrich, Margherita, Texas BBQ, Signature, Hebrew National, Parkay, Blue Bonnet, Fleischmanns, Egg Beaters, Reddi-wip, Angela Mia, Hunts, Healthy Choice, Chef Boyardee, Banquet, Gilardis, Lamb Weston, Holly Ridge, Fernandos, Rosarita, The Max, Singleton, Wesson, PAM, Peter Pan, Van Camps, Guldens, J. Hungerford Smith, Manwich, Hunts Snack Pack, Swiss Miss, Knotts Berry Farm, La Choy, Gebhardt and Wolf Brand.
Food Ingredients The Food Ingredients segment includes certain branded and commodity food ingredients, including milled grain ingredients, seasonings, blends and flavorings, which are sold to food processors, as well as certain commodity sourcing and merchandising operations.
Unconsolidated Equity Investments The company has a number of unconsolidated equity investments. The more significant equity investments are involved in fresh beef and pork processing, barley malting, and potato production. The companys fresh beef and pork joint equity investment was established in fiscal 2003 when the company sold a controlling interest in its fresh beef and pork operations.
Discontinued Operations During fiscal 2004, the company completed the divestitures of its chicken business, its U.S. and Canadian crop inputs businesses and its Spanish feed business.
Subsequent to fiscal year end 2004, the company disposed of its Portuguese poultry business. The company is actively marketing UAP International and plans to dispose of these operations during fiscal 2005. Accordingly, the company now reflects the results of operations for each of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
General The following comments pertain to each of the companys reporting segments.
ConAgra Foods is a food company that operates in many different areas of the food industry, with a significant focus on the sale of branded and value-added consumer products. ConAgra Foods uses many different raw materials, the bulk of which are commodities. The prices paid for raw materials used in the products of ConAgra Foods generally reflect factors such as weather, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental 3 agricultural programs. Although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors, the company believes such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources. The company uses hedging techniques to minimize the impact of price fluctuations in its principal raw materials. However, it does not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and these strategies may not fully protect the company or its subsidiaries from increases in specific raw material costs.
The company experiences intense competition for sales of its principal products in its major markets. The companys products compete with widely advertised, well-known, branded products, as well as private label and customized products. The company has major competitors in each of its reporting segments.
Quality control processes at principal manufacturing locations emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control. In addition, the company conducts research activities related to the development of new products.
Many of ConAgra Foods facilities and products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration and other federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the quality of products, sanitation, safety and environmental control. The company believes that it complies with such laws and regulations in all material respects, and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the company.
At May 30, 2004, ConAgra Foods and its subsidiaries had approximately 39,000 employees, primarily in the United States.
d) Foreign Operations Foreign operations information is set forth in note19 Business Segments and Related Information on pages 88 through 90 of the companys 2004 Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference.
e) Available Information The company makes available, free of charge through its Internet website at http://www.conagrafoods.com, its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Risk Factors The following factors could affect the companys operating results and should be considered in evaluating the company.
The company must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences.
Consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of the companys food products depends on the companys ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences. The company introduces new products and improved products in all of its business segments from time to time and incurs significant development and marketing costs. If the companys products fail to meet consumer preference, then the companys strategy to grow sales and profits with new products will be less successful.
If the company does not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry, its profitability could decrease.
The companys success depends in part on its ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and be efficient 4 in the highly competitive food industry. The company is currently implementing profit-enhancing initiatives that impact its marketing, sales, operations and information systems functions. These initiatives include: elimination of duplicative costs and overhead; consolidation of selected plants and support functions; efforts to streamline and improve the companys ability to do business with its customers, distributors and brokers; and realignment of business organizations. If the company does not continue to manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies, its competitiveness and its profitability could decrease.
Increased competition may result in reduced sales for the company.
The food industry is highly competitive, and increased competition can reduce sales for the company.
The consolidation of the companys retail customers has resulted in large sophisticated customers with increased buying power.
The companys retail customers, such as supermarkets and warehouse clubs, have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue. These consolidations have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of resisting price increases and operating with reduced inventories. These customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space, currently used for company products, for their private label products. If the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength or less shelf space for company products, the companys profitability could decline.
The company may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls, which could negatively impact its profitability.
The company sells food products for human consumption, which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage, product tampering and other adulteration of food products. The company may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of its products causes injury, illness or death. In addition, the company will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage. In the past, the company has issued recalls and has from time to time been involved in lawsuits relating to its food products. A significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact the companys profitability for a period of time depending on product availability, competitive reaction and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that company products caused illness or injury could adversely affect the companys reputation with existing and potential customers and its corporate and brand image.
Commodity price increases will increase operating costs and may reduce profits.
The company uses many different commodities including wheat, corn, oats, soybeans, beef, pork, poultry and energy. Commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, and changes in governmental agricultural programs. Commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material costs and operating costs. The company may not be able to increase its product prices to offset these increased costs; and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume and profitability. The company has many years experience in hedging against commodity price increases; however, hedging practices reduce but do not eliminate the risk of increased operating costs from commodity price increases. For example, higher commodity prices in fiscal 2004, which were not fully offset by higher selling prices, negatively affected the companys operating profit.
If the company fails to comply with the many laws applicable to its business, it may incur significant fines and penalties.
The companys facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, quality, and safety of food products. The companys failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject it to administrative penalties and injunctive relief, civil remedies, including fines, injunctions and recalls of its products. The companys operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and 5 disposition of wastes. Failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity.

6 ITEM 3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In fiscal 1991, ConAgra Foods acquired Beatrice Company (Beatrice). As a result of the acquisition and the significant pre-acquisition contingencies of the Beatrice businesses and its former subsidiaries, the consolidated post-acquisition financial statements of the company reflect significant liabilities associated with the estimated resolution of these contingencies. These include various litigation and environmental proceedings related to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to its acquisition by the company. The environmental proceedings include litigation and administrative proceedings involving Beatrices status as a potentially responsible party at 39 Superfund, proposed Superfund or state-equivalent sites; these sites involve locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of Beatrice that used or produced petroleum, pesticides, fertilizers, dyes, inks, solvents, PCBs, acids, lead, sulfur, tannery wastes, and / or other contaminants. Beatrice has paid or is in the process of paying its liability share at 34 of these sites. Reserves for these matters have been established based on the companys best estimate of its undiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required cleanup, the known volumetric contribution of Beatrice and other potentially responsible parties and its experience in remediating sites. The reserves for Beatrice environmental matters totaled $115.2 million as of May 30, 2004, and $121.2 million as of May 25, 2003, a majority of which relates to the Superfund and state equivalent sites referenced above. Expenditures for these matters are expected to occur over a period of 5 to 20 years.
On June 22, 2001, the company filed an amended annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 28, 2000. The filing included restated financial information for fiscal years 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000. The restatement, due to accounting and conduct matters at United Agri Products, Inc. (UAP), a former subsidiary, was based upon an investigation undertaken by the company and the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors. The restatement was principally related to revenue recognition for deferred delivery sales and vendor rebates, advance vendor rebates, and bad debt reserves. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a formal order of nonpublic investigation dated September 28, 2001. The company is cooperating with the SEC investigation, which relates to the UAP matters described above, as well as other aspects of the companys financial statements, including the level and application of certain of the companys reserves.
The company is currently conducting discussions with the SEC Staff regarding a possible settlement of these matters. Based on discussions to date, the company established a $25 million reserve in fiscal 2004 in connection with matters related to this investigation. Due to the nature of the ongoing discussions, the company cannot predict whether the discussions will result in a settlement and is unable to determine the ultimate cost the company may incur in order to resolve this matter. Any final resolution could result in charges greater than the amount currently estimated and recognized in the companys financial statements.
On August 10, 2001, a purported class action lawsuit, Gebhardt v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et. al. Case No. 810CV427, was filed in United States District Court for Nebraska against the company and certain of its executive officers alleging violations of the federal securities laws in connection with the events resulting in the companys restatement of its financial statements. The complaint seeks a declaration that the action is maintainable as a class action and that the plaintiff is a proper class representative, unspecified compensatory damages, reasonable attorneys fees and any other relief deemed proper by the court. On July 23, 2002, the federal district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the lawsuit and entered judgment in favor of the company and the executive officers. On June 30, 2003, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal. The defendants thereafter renewed their motion to dismiss in the district court on the issues not previously addressed by the district court in its prior dismissal of the lawsuit. On December 10, 2003, the district court denied the defendants motion to dismiss on these other issues. The company believes the lawsuit is without merit and plans to vigorously defend the action.
On September 26, 2001, a shareholder derivative action was filed, purportedly on behalf of the company, by plaintiffs Anthony F. Rolfes and Sandra S. Rolfes in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware in New Castle County, Case No. 19130NC. The complaint alleges that the defendants, directors of the company during the relevant times, breached fiduciary duties in connection with events resulting in the companys restatement of its financial statements. The action seeks, inter alia, recovery to the company, which is named as a nominal defendant in the action, of damages allegedly sustained by the company and a direction to the defendants to establish programs to prevent wrongful and illegal practices. On October 9, 2001, a second shareholder derivative action was filed, purportedly on behalf of the company, by plaintiff Harbor Finance Partners in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska, Case No. 401CV3255. The complaint contains allegations and seeks relief similar to the Delaware derivative action. The directors named as defendants in these actions intend to vigorously defend the 7 allegations and believe the actions are without merit.
The company is a party to a number of other lawsuits and claims arising out of the operation of its businesses. After taking into account liabilities recorded for all of the foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
