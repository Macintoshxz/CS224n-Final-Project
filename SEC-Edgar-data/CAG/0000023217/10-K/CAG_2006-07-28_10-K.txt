1 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS a)General Development of Business ConAgra Foods,Inc. ("ConAgra Foods" or the "company") is a leading packaged food company serving a wide variety of food customers. The company's food sales accounted for approximately 87% of its fiscal 2002 net sales of $27.6billion.
On September28, 2000, ConAgra,Inc. changed its name to ConAgra Foods,Inc. to indicate a focus on serving food customers. Prior to that time, the company was known as ConAgra,Inc. from February25, 1971 to September27, 2000 and from September29, 1919 through February24, 1971, the company was known as Nebraska Consolidated Mills Company.
Over time, both acquisitions and operations have contributed to the company's growth. The company's more significant acquisitions have included Beatrice Company in 1990, Golden Valley Microwave Foods in 1992 and International Home Foods in 2001. In recent years, ConAgra Foods has been pursuing an acquisition and divestiture strategy to shift its focus toward its core branded and value-added food products.
On May21, 2002, the company announced an agreement to transfer its fresh beef and pork processing businesses to a new venture, 54% owned by an investor group led by Hicks, Muse, Tate& Furst,Incorporated, and 46% owned by the company.
b)Financial Information about Reporting Segments The company's operations are classified into four reporting segments: Packaged Foods, Food Ingredients, Meat Processing and Agricultural Products. The contributions of each reporting segment to net sales and operating profit, and the identifiable assets attributable to each reporting segment are set forth in Note20 "Business Segments and Related Information" on pages 64 through 66 of the company's 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders and are incorporated herein by reference.
c)Narrative Description of Business The company competes throughout the food industry and focuses on adding value for customers who sell into the retail food, foodservice, ingredients and agricultural products channels.
ConAgra Foods reporting segments are described below. The ConAgra Foods companies and locations, including distribution facilities, within each reporting segment are described in Item 2.
Packaged Foods In its Packaged Foods segment, ConAgra Foods produces shelf-stable, frozen and refrigerated foods which are processed and packaged for sales primarily to retail and foodservice customers.
Shelf-stable products include tomato products, pasta products, cooking oils, popcorn, soup, puddings, meat snacks, canned beans, canned pasta, tuna, canned chili, cocoa mixes and peanut butter for retail, foodservice, institutional and specialty market customers. Shelf-stable major brands include Hunt's, Healthy Choice, Chef Boyardee, Wesson, Orville Redenbacher's, PAM, Slim Jim, Act II, Peter Pan, Van Camp's, Gulden's, Beanee Weenee, Manwich, Hunt's Snack Pack, Swiss Miss, Knott's Berry Farm, Bumble Bee, La Choy, Gebhardt, David's, Wolf Brand, Pemmican, Penrose and Andy Capp's.

Food Ingredients The Food Ingredients segment includes the company's non-grain based ingredients, such as processed seasonings, blends and flavorings as well as grain-based items which are processed for ingredient use.
Meat Processing In its Meat Processing segment, ConAgra Foods produces and markets fresh beef, chicken, turkey and pork for retail and foodservice customers. In May2002, the company announced an agreement to sell a controlling interest in its fresh beef and pork operations, which accounted for 77% of the segment's net sales and 71% of its operating profit in fiscal 2002.
Agricultural Products Through its Agricultural Products segment, ConAgra Foods distributes crop protection chemicals, fertilizers, seeds and information systems at wholesale and retail levels. Major agricultural brands include Clean Crop, ACA, Savage, Shotgun, Saber, Signature, and Loveland Industries. Within this segment, the company also originates, markets, merchandises and trades agricultural and energy commodities and byproducts, and provides related risk management services. The Agricultural Products segment experiences some seasonality. This seasonality coincides with normal agricultural growing seasons and is subject to a variety of economic, governmental and weather related conditions.
General The following comments pertain to each of the company's reporting segments.
ConAgra Foods is a food company that operates in many different areas of the food industry, with a significant focus on the sale of branded and value-added consumer products. As a result, ConAgra Foods uses many different raw materials, the bulk of which are commodities. Raw materials are generally available from several different sources and ConAgra Foods presently believes that it can obtain these as needed.
The company experiences intense competition for sales of its principal products in its major markets. The company's products compete with widely advertised, well-known, branded products, as well as private label and customized products. The company has major competitors in all of its reporting segments.
Quality control processes at principal manufacturing locations emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control. In addition, the company conducts research activities related to the development of new products.
Many of ConAgra Foods' facilities and products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration and other federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the quality of products, sanitation, safety and environmental control. The company believes that it complies with such laws and regulations in all material respects, and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of 3 the company.
ConAgra Foods and its subsidiaries have approximately 89,000 employees, primarily in the United States.
d)Foreign Operations Foreign operations information is set forth in Note20 "Business Segments and Related Information" on pages 64 through 66 of the company's 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference.
Risk Factors The following factors could affect the company's operating results and should be considered in evaluating the company.
The company must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences.
Consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of the company's food products depends on the company's ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences. The company introduces new products and improved products in all of its business segments from time to time and incurs significant development and marketing cost. If the company's products fail to meet consumer preference, then the company's strategy to grow sales and profits with new products will be less successful.
If the company does not manage costs in the highly competitive food industry, its profitability could decrease.
The company's success depends in part on its ability to manage costs and be efficient in the highly competitive food industry. The company has in recent years eliminated excess costs and achieved additional efficiencies by aligning sales, marketing, and manufacturing functions. If the company does not continue to manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies, its profitability could decrease.
The company may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls, which could negatively impact its profitability.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated there are more than 250 different foodborne diseases that cause approximately 76million illnesses, more than 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths annually in the United States. Products in an uncooked or raw state may contain some level of pathogens which remain until cooked. In addition to foodborne illness, some consumers are sensitive to or allergic to a variety of common ingredients. In the past the company has issued recalls to address the presence of allergens and pathogens. Once products have been shipped for distribution, illness or death may result if the pathogens are present, or increase due to handling or temperatures, if they are not eliminated at the further processing, foodservice or consumer level. If the company detects problems, it takes prompt action to protect consumers. The consensus among health industry and government experts is that simple, proper cooking procedures are the most common and effective way to eliminate the risk associated with pathogens.
The company may be subject to significant liability if the consumption of any of the company's products causes injury, illness or death and the company will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage. For example, between June30 and July19, 2002, the company voluntarily recalled approximately 19million pounds of ground beef that may have been contaminated with E. coli. The company may encounter the same risks if a third party tampers with its products. A significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may also negatively impact the company's profitability for a period of time depending on availability, competitive reaction and consumer attitudes.
4 For the Agricultural Products segment, downturns in the agricultural industry reduce product demand, create a difficult product pricing environment, and make credit collection more difficult.
The agricultural industry is cyclical and subject to a variety of economic, governmental and weather related conditions. Weather patterns, livestock and crop diseases, uncertainty over farm policy, and other farming related factors have caused downturns in the agricultural industry in recent years. Factors that negatively affect the agricultural industry reduce farm income, which results in less demand for agricultural products and a less favorable product pricing environment and negatively affects the ability of customers to pay for products purchased on credit. These factors negatively affected the fiscal 2002 operating results for the company's Agricultural Products segment, which reflected a sales decline of 2% and an operating profit decline of 83% compared to fiscal 2001. For fiscal 2002, the company's Agricultural Products segment represented approximately 13% of the company's total sales and less than 1% of the company's total operating profit.
Commodity price increases will increase operating costs and may reduce profits.
The company uses many different commodities, including wheat, corn, oats, soybeans and energy. Commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, and changes in governmental agricultural programs. Commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material costs and operating costs. The company may not be able to increase its product prices to offset these increased costs; and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume and profitability. The company has many years' experience in hedging against commodity price increases; however, hedging practices reduce but do not eliminate the risk of increased operating costs from commodity price increases. For example, significant energy price increases, such as were experienced in fiscal 2001, impacted the company's results.
If the company fails to comply with the many laws applicable to its business, it may incur significant fines and penalties.
The company's facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, quality, and safety of food products. The company's failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject it to administrative penalties and injunctive relief, civil remedies, including fines, injunctions and recalls of its products. The company's operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes. Failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity.
The company incurs significant costs in complying with laws and regulations.
The company incurs significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with laws and regulations. For example, the company's financial statement footnote on "Contingencies" describes continuing costs for compliance with environmental laws. Future material changes in these laws and regulations could increase the company's operating costs. Various governments throughout the world are considering regulatory proposals relating to genetically modified organisms or ingredients, food safety, and market regulation which, if adopted, will increase the company's operating costs. If any of these or other proposals are enacted, the company may not be able to pass on these cost increases to customers without experiencing volume and profit losses.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In fiscal 1991, ConAgra acquired Beatrice Company ("Beatrice"). As a result of the acquisition and the significant pre-acquisition contingencies of the Beatrice businesses and its former subsidiaries, the consolidated post-acquisition financial statements of the company reflect significant liabilities associated with the estimated resolution of these contingencies. These include various litigation and environmental proceedings related to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to its acquisition by the company. The environmental proceedings include litigation and administrative proceedings involving Beatrice's status as a potentially responsible party at 32 Superfund, proposed Superfund or state- 9 equivalent sites; these sites involve locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of Beatrice which used or produced petroleum, pesticides, fertilizers, dyes, inks, solvents, PCBs, acids, lead, sulfur, tannery wastes, and / or other contaminants. Beatrice has paid or is in the process of paying its liability share at 31 of these sites. Adequate reserves for these matters have been established based on the company's best estimate of its undiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required cleanup, the known volumetric contribution of Beatrice and other potentially responsible parties and its experience in remediating sites. The reserves for Beatrice environmental matters totaled $119.3million as of May26, 2002, and $123.0million as of May27, 2001, a majority of which relates to the Superfund and state equivalent sites referenced above. Expenditures for these matters are expected to occur over a period of 5 to 20years.
On June22, 2001, the company filed an amended annual report on Form10-K for the fiscal year ended May28, 2000. The filing included restated financial information for fiscal years 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000. The restatement, due to accounting and conduct matters at its United Agri Products,Inc. subsidiary ("UAP"), was based upon an investigation undertaken by the company and the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors. The restatement was principally related to revenue recognition for deferred delivery sales and vendor rebates, advance vendor rebates, and bad debt reserves. The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued a formal order of nonpublic investigation dated September28, 2001. The company is cooperating with the SEC investigation, which relates to the UAP matters described above, as well as other aspects of the company's financial statements.
On August10, 2001, a purported class action lawsuit, Gebhardt v. ConAgra Foods,Inc., et. al. Case No.810CV427, was filed in United States District Court for Nebraska against the company and certain of its executive officers alleging violations of the federal securities laws in connection with the events resulting in the company's restatement of its financial statements. On July23, 2002, the federal district court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the lawsuit and entered judgment in favor of the company and the executive officers. On August 20, 2002, the plaintiffs appealed the judgment to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.
On September26, 2001, a shareholder derivative action was filed, purportedly on behalf of the company, by plaintiffs Anthony F. Rolfes and Sandra S. Rolfes in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware in New Castle County, Case No.19130NC. The complaint alleges that the defendants, directors of the company during the relevant times, breached fiduciary duties in connection with events resulting in the company's restatement of its financial statements. The action seeks, inter alia, recovery to the Company, which is named as a nominal defendant in the action, of damages allegedly sustained by the Company and a direction to the defendants to establish programs to prevent wrongful and illegal practices. On October9, 2001, a second shareholder derivative action was filed, purportedly on behalf of the company, by plaintiff Harbor Finance Partners in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska, Case No.401CV3255. The complaint contains allegations and seeks relief similar to the Delaware derivative action. The directors named as defendants in these actions intend to vigorously defend the allegations and believe the actions are without merit.
The company's subsidiary, ConAgra Grocery Products Company, paid a total of $141,000 in connection with the settlement of an administrative civil liability complaint, ACL Complaint No. R5-2002-0507, issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Central Valley Region on May14, 2002, with respect to wastewater discharges.
The company is a party to a number of other lawsuits and claims arising out of the operation of its businesses. After taking into account liabilities recorded for all of the foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
