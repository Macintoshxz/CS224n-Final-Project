1 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS a) General Development of Business ConAgra Foods, Inc. (ConAgra Foods or the company) is a leading packaged food company serving a wide variety of food customers. Over time, the company, which was first incorporated in 1919, has grown through acquisitions, operations and internal brand and product development.
ConAgra Foods is focused on improving profit margins and returns on capital. To that end, the company has significantly changed its portfolio of businesses over the last few years, divesting strategically non-core businesses and focusing on branded, value-added food opportunities. Executing this strategy has involved the acquisition of several brands such as Chef Boyardee, Egg Beaters, Guldens, Libbys, PAM, and Slim Jim as well as divestitures of the companys chicken business, its U.S. and Canadian crop inputs businesses (UAP North America), its international crop inputs businesses (UAP International), a Spanish feed business and Portuguese poultry business, its fresh beef and pork business (fresh beef and pork divestiture), its specialty meats foodservice business, its canned seafood operations, and its processed cheese operations. As part of this strategy, the company has also embarked on a significant upgrading and overhaul of the marketing, operations, and business process systems throughout the company through various initiatives. The purpose of those initiatives is to:  continually strengthen brand equities,  reduce the complexity and cost of major operating functions including procurement, manufacturing, and logistics, and  improve customer service.
The company expects the multi-year profit-enhancing initiatives in its marketing, operating, and business process functions to continue for the next few years.
b) Financial Information about Reporting Segments For fiscal 2005 and 2004, the companys operations are classified into three reporting segments: Retail Products, Foodservice Products and Food Ingredients. For fiscal 2003 and prior years, the companys operations also include a Meat Processing reporting segment which reflects results associated with the companys fresh beef and pork operations prior to the company selling a controlling interest in the operations during fiscal 2003. The contributions of each reporting segment to net sales and operating profit, and the identifiable assets attributable to each reporting segment are set forth in Note20 Business Segments and Related Information to the consolidated financial statements.
c) Narrative Description of Business The company competes throughout the food industry and focuses on adding value for customers who sell into the retail food, foodservice and ingredients channels. The companys largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores,Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 11% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2005, primarily in the Retail Products segment.
ConAgra Foods operations, including its reporting segments, are described below. The ConAgra Foods companies and locations, including distribution facilities, within each reporting segment, are described in Item 2.
Retail Products The Retail Products reporting segment includes branded foods in the shelf-stable, frozen and refrigerated temperature classes which are sold in various retail channels.
2 Shelf-stable products include tomato products, cooking oils, popcorn, soup, puddings, meat snacks, canned beans, canned pasta, canned chili, cocoa mixes and peanut butter for retail and deli customers. Shelf-stable major brands include Hunts, Healthy Choice, Chef Boyardee, Wesson, Orville Redenbachers, PAM, Slim Jim, ACT II, Peter Pan, Van Camps, Guldens, Beanee Weenee, Manwich, Hunts Snack Pack, Swiss Miss, Knotts Berry Farm, La Choy, Gebhardt, DAVID, Wolf, Pemmican, Penrose and Andy Capps.
Frozen food products include dinners, pizzas, turkeys, entrees, snacks, desserts, ice cream, potato products, hand-held dough-based products and seafood for retail and deli customers. Frozen food major brands include Healthy Choice, Golden Cuisine, Banquet, Marie Callenders, Butterball, Kid Cuisine, MaMa Rosas, Rosarita, Morton, Patio, La Choy, Artel and Wolfgang Puck.
Refrigerated food products include hot dogs, bacon, ham, sausages, cold cuts, turkey products, ethnic foods, kosher products, meat alternative products (e.g., soy-based hot dogs and patties), tablespreads, egg alternatives and dessert toppings for retail and deli customers. Refrigerated food major brands include Armour, Butterball, Cooks, Decker, Eckrich, Healthy Choice, Louis Kemp, Ready Crisp, Hebrew National, Brown N Serve, Lightlife, Parkay, Blue Bonnet, Fleischmanns, Egg Beaters and Reddi-wip.
Foodservice Products The Foodservice Products reporting segment includes branded and customized food products, including meals, entrees, prepared potatoes, meats, seafood, sauces, and a variety of custom-manufactured culinary products packaged for sale to restaurants and other foodservice establishments.
Major brands include Armour, Butterball, County Line, Cooks, Decker, Longmont, Eckrich, Margherita, Texas BBQ, Signature, Hebrew National, Parkay, Blue Bonnet, Fleischmanns, Egg Beaters, Reddi-wip, Angela Mia, Hunts, Healthy Choice, Chef Boyardee, Banquet, Gilardis, Lamb Weston, Holly Ridge, Fernandos, Rosarita, The Max, Singleton, Wesson, PAM, Peter Pan, Van Camps, Guldens, J. Hungerford Smith, Manwich, Hunts Snack Pack, Swiss Miss, Knotts Berry Farm, La Choy, Gebhardt and Wolf.
Food Ingredients The Food Ingredients segment includes certain branded and commodity food ingredients, including milled grain ingredients, seasonings, blends and flavorings, which are sold under names such as ConAgra Mills, Gilroy Foods and Spicetec to food processors, as well as certain commodity trading, sourcing and merchandising operations.
Unconsolidated Equity Investments The company has a number of unconsolidated equity investments. The more significant equity investments are involved in barley malting and potato production. The company divested of its minority equity interest investment in a fresh beef and pork joint venture in fiscal 2005. This joint venture was established in fiscal 2003 when the company sold a controlling interest in its fresh beef and pork operations.
Discontinued Operations During fiscal 2005, the company completed the divestitures of its international crop inputs businesses (UAP International) and its Portuguese poultry business. Also in fiscal 2005, the company implemented a plan to exit the specialty meats foodservice business. The company closed a manufacturing facility in Alabama, sold its operations in California and, in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, completed the sale of its operations in Illinois. Upon the sale of the Illinois operations, the company has no further specialty meats operations. During fiscal 2004, the company completed the divestitures of its chicken business, its U.S. and Canadian crop inputs businesses (UAP North America) and its Spanish feed business.
Accordingly, the results of operations of the chicken business, UAP North America, UAP International, the Spanish feed business and Portuguese poultry business, and the specialty meats 3 foodservice business are reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Beginning September 24, 2004, the results of operations of the cattle feeding business are presented in discontinued operations.
General The following comments pertain to each of the companys reporting segments.
ConAgra Foods is a food company that operates in many different areas of the food industry, with a significant focus on the sale of branded and value-added consumer products. ConAgra Foods uses many different raw materials, the bulk of which are commodities. The prices paid for raw materials used in the products of ConAgra Foods generally reflect factors such as weather, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs. Although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors, the company believes such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources. The company uses hedging techniques to minimize the impact of price fluctuations in its principal raw materials. However, it does not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and these strategies may not fully protect the company or its subsidiaries from increases in specific raw material costs.
The company experiences intense competition for sales of its principal products in its major markets. The companys products compete with widely advertised, well-known, branded products, as well as private label and customized products. The company has major competitors in each of its reporting segments.
Quality control processes at principal manufacturing locations emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control. In addition, the company conducts research activities related to the development of new products.
Demand for certain of the companys products may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons or other annual events.
The company manufactures primarily for stock and fills customer orders from finished goods inventories. While at any given time there may be some backlog of orders, such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales, and the changes from time to time are not significant.
Many of ConAgra Foods facilities and products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration and other federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the quality of products, sanitation, safety and environmental control. The company believes that it complies with such laws and regulations in all material respects, and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the company.
At May 29, 2005, ConAgra Foods and its subsidiaries had approximately 38,000 employees, primarily in the United States.
d) Foreign Operations Foreign operations information is set forth in Note20 Business Segments and Related Information to the consolidated financial statements.
e) Available Information The company makes available, free of charge through its Internet web site at http://www.conagrafoods.com, its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as soon as reasonably 4 practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company submitted the annual Chief Executive Officer certification to the NYSE for its 2005 fiscal year as required by Section 303A.12(a) of the NYSE Corporate Governance rules.
The company has also posted on its website its (1) Corporate Governance Principles, (2) Code of Conduct, (3) Code of Ethics for Senior Corporate Officers, (4) charters for the Audit Committee, Corporate Affairs Committee, Corporate Governance Committee, Human Resources Committee and Nominating Committee. Shareholders may also obtain copies of these items at no charge by writing to Assistant Corporate Secretary, ConAgra Foods, Inc., One ConAgra Drive, Omaha, NE, 68102-5001.
Risk Factors The following factors could affect the companys operating results and should be considered in evaluating the company.
The company must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences.
Consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of the companys food products depends on the companys ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences. The company introduces new products and improved products in all of its business segments from time to time and incurs significant development and marketing costs. If the companys products fail to meet consumer preference, then the companys strategy to grow sales and profits with new products will be less successful.
If the company does not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry, its profitability could decrease.
The companys success depends in part on its ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and be efficient in the highly competitive food industry. The company is currently implementing profit-enhancing initiatives that impact its marketing, sales, operations and information systems functions. These initiatives include: elimination of duplicative costs and overhead; consolidation of selected plants and support functions; efforts to streamline and improve the companys ability to do business with its customers, distributors and brokers; and realignment of business organizations. If the company does not continue to manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies, its competitiveness and its profitability could decrease.
Increased competition may result in reduced sales for the company.
The food industry is highly competitive, and increased competition can reduce sales for the company.
The consolidation of the companys customers has resulted in large sophisticated customers with increased buying power.
The companys customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors, have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue. These consolidations have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of resisting price increases and operating with reduced inventories. These customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space, currently used for company products, for their private label products. If the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength or less shelf space for company products, the companys profitability could decline.
The company may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls, which could negatively impact its profitability.
The company sells food products for human consumption, which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage, product tampering and other adulteration of food products. The company may be subject to liability if the 5 consumption of any of its products causes injury, illness or death. In addition, the company will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage. In the past, the company has issued recalls and has from time to time been involved in lawsuits relating to its food products. A significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact the companys profitability for a period of time depending on product availability, competitive reaction and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that company products caused illness or injury could adversely affect the companys reputation with existing and potential customers and its corporate and brand image.
Commodity price increases will increase operating costs and may reduce profits.
The company uses many different commodities including wheat, corn, oats, soybeans, beef, pork, poultry and energy. Commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, and changes in governmental agricultural programs. Commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material costs and operating costs. The company may not be able to increase its product prices to offset these increased costs; and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume and profitability. The company has many years experience in hedging against commodity price increases; however, hedging practices reduce but do not eliminate the risk of increased operating costs from commodity price increases. For example, higher commodity prices in fiscal 2004 and 2005, which were not fully offset by higher selling prices, negatively affected the companys operating profit.
The companys information technology resources must provide efficient connections between its business functions, or its results of operations will be negatively impacted.
Each year the company engages in several billion dollars of transactions with its customers and vendors. Because the amount of dollars involved is so significant, the companys information technology resources must provide connections among its marketing, sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer services and accounting functions. If the company does not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain the related computerized and manual control processes, it could be subject to billing and collection errors, business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches. In 2005, in connection with its implementation of Project Nucleus , the companys information technology-linking initiative, the company had short-term operational challenges during the third quarter of fiscal 2005.
If the company fails to comply with the many laws applicable to its business, it may incur significant fines and penalties.
The companys facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, quality, and safety of food products. The companys failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject it to administrative penalties and injunctive relief, civil remedies, including fines, injunctions and recalls of its products. The companys operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes. Failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES The companys headquarters are located in Omaha, Nebraska. In addition, certain shared service centers are located in Omaha, Nebraska, including a product development facility, customer service center, financial service center and information technology center. The general offices and location of principal operations are set forth in the following summary of ConAgra Foods locations.
The company maintains a number of stand-alone distribution facilities. In addition, there is warehouse space available at substantially all of its manufacturing facilities.
6 Utilization of manufacturing capacity varies by manufacturing plant based upon the type of products assigned and the level of demand for those products. Management believes that the companys manufacturing and processing plants are well maintained and are generally adequate to support the current operations of the business.
The company owns most of the manufacturing facilities. However, a limited number of plants and parcels of land with the related manufacturing equipment are leased. Substantially all of ConAgra Foods transportation equipment and forward-positioned distribution centers containing finished goods are leased.

7 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In fiscal 1991, ConAgra Foods acquired Beatrice Company (Beatrice). As a result of the acquisition and the significant pre-acquisition contingencies of the Beatrice businesses and its former subsidiaries, the consolidated post-acquisition financial statements of the company reflect significant liabilities associated with the estimated resolution of these contingencies. These include various litigation and environmental proceedings related to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to its acquisition by the company. The environmental proceedings include litigation and administrative proceedings involving Beatrices status as a potentially responsible party at 31 Superfund, proposed Superfund or state-equivalent sites; these sites involve locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of Beatrice that used or produced petroleum, pesticides, fertilizers, dyes, inks, solvents, PCBs, acids, lead, sulfur, tannery wastes, and / or other contaminants. Beatrice has paid or is in the process of paying its liability share at 30 of these sites. Reserves for these matters have been established based on the companys best estimate of its undiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required cleanup, the known volumetric contribution of Beatrice and other potentially responsible parties and its experience in remediating sites. The reserves for Beatrice environmental matters totaled $109.5 million as of May 29, 2005, and $115.2 million as of May 30, 2004, a majority of which relates to the Superfund and state equivalent sites referenced above. Expenditures for these matters are expected to occur over a period of 5 to 20 years.
On June 22, 2001, the company filed an amended annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 28, 2000. The filing included restated financial information for fiscal years 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000. The restatement, due to accounting and conduct matters at United Agri Products, Inc. (UAP), a former subsidiary, was based upon an investigation undertaken by the company and the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors. The restatement was principally related to revenue recognition for deferred delivery sales and vendor rebates, advance vendor rebates, and bad debt reserves. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a formal order of nonpublic investigation dated September 28, 2001. The company is cooperating with the SEC investigation, which relates to the UAP matters described above, as well as other aspects of the companys financial statements, including the level and application of certain of the companys reserves.
The company is currently conducting discussions with the SEC Staff regarding a possible settlement of these matters. Based on discussions to date, the company estimates the amount of such settlement and related payments to be approximately $46.5 million. The company recorded charges of $25 million and $21.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and the third quarter of fiscal 2005, respectively, in connection with the expected settlement of these matters. There can be no assurance that the negotiations with the SEC Staff will ultimately be successful or that the SEC will accept the terms of any settlement that is negotiated with the SEC Staff. Accordingly, the terms of any settlement, if reached, could result in charges greater than the amount currently estimated and recognized in the companys financial statements.
On August 10, 2001, a purported class action lawsuit, Gebhardt v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et. al., Case No. 810CV427, was filed in United States District Court for Nebraska against the company and certain of its executive officers alleging violations of the federal securities laws in connection with the events resulting in the companys June 2001 restatement of its financial statements. The complaint sought a declaration that the action was maintainable as a class action and that the plaintiff was a proper class representative, unspecified compensatory damages, reasonable attorneys fees and any other relief deemed proper by the court. The company reached an agreement, which received final approval by the court on May 24, 2005, to settle the lawsuit for $14 million. The settlement, which is largely covered by insurance, is without admission of liability or wrongdoing.
On September 26, 2001, a shareholder derivative action was filed, purportedly on behalf of the company, by plaintiffs Anthony F. Rolfes and Sandra S. Rolfes in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware in New Castle County, Case No. 19130NC. The complaint alleged that the defendants, directors of the company during the relevant times, breached fiduciary duties in connection with events resulting in the companys June 2001 restatement of its financial statements. The action sought, inter alia, recovery to the company, which is named as a nominal defendant in the action, of damages allegedly sustained by the company and a direction to the defendants to establish programs 8 to prevent wrongful and illegal practices. On October 9, 2001, a second shareholder derivative action was filed, purportedly on behalf of the company, by plaintiff Harbor Finance Partners in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska, Case No. 401CV3255. The complaint contained allegations and sought relief similar to the Delaware derivative action. The company has reached agreement to settle the lawsuits for the cost of plaintiffs attorney fees of $300,000, which will be covered by insurance. The settlement includes certain undertakings and is without admission of liability or wrongdoing. The settlement was preliminarily approved by the court on June 13, 2005, and following completion of steps incident to the settlement process, will be submitted to the court for final approval.
On April 29, 2005, the company filed an amended annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 30, 2004 and amended quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended August 29, 2004 and November 28, 2004. The filings included restated financial information for fiscal years 2002, 2003, 2004 and the first two quarters of fiscal 2005. The restatement related to tax matters. In addition, the company is providing information to the SEC Staff relating to the facts and circumstances surrounding the restatement. On June 21, 2005, a purported class action, Berlien v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et. al.
, Case No. 805CV292 was filed in United States District Court for Nebraska, and on June 30, 2005, a purported class action , Calvacca v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et. al ., Case No. 805CV00318 was filed in the same court. On July26, 2005, a purported class action, Woods v. ConAgra Foods,Inc., et. al ., Case No.6707, was filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Each lawsuit is against the company and its chief executive officer. The lawsuits allege violations of the federal securities laws in connection with the events resulting in the companys April 2005 restatement of its financial statements and related matters. Each complaint seeks a declaration that the action is maintainable as a class action and that the plaintiff is a proper class representative, unspecified compensatory damages, reasonable attorneys fees and any other relief deemed proper by the court. The company believes the lawsuits are without merit and plans to vigorously defend the actions.
On July 15, 2005, two derivative actions were filed by shareholder plaintiff Gerald Halpern, Case No. 805CV342, and shareholder plaintiff Shawn Van Hees, Case No. 805CV343, and on July26, 2005, a derivative action was filed by shareholder plaintiff Charles Zimmerman, Case No.405CV3183, purportedly on behalf of the company, in United States District Court for Nebraska. The complaints alleged that the defendants, directors and certain executive officers of the company during the relevant times, breached fiduciary duties in connection with events resulting in the companys April 2005 restatement of its financial statements and related matters. The actions seek, inter alia, recovery to the company, which was named as a nominal defendant in the action, of damages allegedly sustained by the company and for reimbursement and restitution. The officers and directors named as defendants in the action intend to vigorously defend the allegations and believe the actions are without merit.
On July 18, 2005, purported class actions, Rantala v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et. al ., Case No. 805CV349, and Bright v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et. al ., Case No. 805CV348 were filed in United States District Court for Nebraska. The lawsuits are against the company and its directors and its employee benefits committee on behalf of participants in the companys employee retirement income savings plans. The lawsuits allege violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in connection with the events resulting in the companys April 2005 restatement of its financial statements and related matters. Each complaint seeks unspecified amount of damages, injunctive relief, attorneys fees and other equitable monetary relief. The company believes the lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend the actions.
The company is a party to a number of other lawsuits and claims arising out of the operation of its businesses. After taking into account liabilities recorded for all of the foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Several items affect the comparability of results of continuing operations, as discussed in Other Significant Items of Note, below.
Multi-Year Marketing, Operating and Business Process Improvement Initiatives ConAgra Foods is focused on sales and marketing, operating, and business process improvement initiatives that are key to profitable future growth and stronger returns on capital.
Sales and Marketing Initiatives : Growing volumes and improving product mix is essential to long-term success, and requires the company to develop its brands, enhance customer service, find new customers, and go to market with new products that are responsive to consumer preference.
The company is currently implementing fact-based analytical methods for assessing the potential of its brands and products in a disciplined process. This is designed to bring a consistency to the marketing function across retail, foodservice, and ingredients operations. These methods address the fundamentals of the products we sell - taste profile, packaging, product quality, and nutritional statistics - and also help design appropriate consumer communication through advertising and promotion campaigns, store merchandising programs, and appropriate price points.
Operating Initiatives: The company is striving to achieve cost savings by integrating and upgrading the supply chain. The primary areas of emphasis are purchasing, logistics, manufacturing, and the reduction of SKUs (stock keeping units, or individual products).
Purchasing : The company is in the process of consolidating the purchasing activity for major inputs to more effectively and efficiently purchase inputs used across its segments.
Logistics : The company is transitioning from a network of several hundred warehouses across the country to a network defined by 14 mixing centers that will support retail and foodservice operations in strategic locations. This new structure is intended to better utilize truckload shipments and optimize warehouse investment, while also reducing working capital as excess inventory quantities are eliminated.
Manufacturing: The company has been developing plans to consolidate manufacturing facilities, under which 14 inefficient plants will most likely be closed and sold over time. The company expects savings to come from rationalizing plants, and thereby increasing capacity utilization, as well as from implementing best practices relating to overall efficiency throughout all plants.
SKU Rationalization: The company has reduced low-volume, low-margin SKUs over the past few quarters, and plans to continue to do this more aggressively over the next 2-3 years. SKU reduction is expected to reduce complexity and save money throughout the entire supply chain, and also result in an increased focus on the SKUs that have higher profit potential.
General and Administrative Expense and Headcount Reduction : The company is pursuing specific plans for reductions in its anticipated SG&A (selling, general and administrative) cost structure, and those plans include salaried headcount reduction. The reduction of several hundred salaried personnel will be completed by the end of the first quarter in fiscal 2006; those headcount reductions, along with other SG&A expense reduction programs, are expected to save more than $100 million annually once the programs are completed.
Business Process Improvement Initiatives : The company is currently changing its business processes and implementing new information systems so that it has improved connections between the manufacturing, marketing, sales, logistics, customer service and accounting functions. The new processes are intended to improve operating efficiency and relationships with customers and vendors. This is being done through Project Nucleus, which integrates the new information technology platforms and allows the company to better manage important areas such as trade merchandising programs, order management, inventory management, customer payment and collections, and logistics.
Packaged Meats The companys packaged meats operations in the retail and foodservice segments posted weak results in fiscal 2005, resulting primarily from higher input costs and ineffective pricing actions that did not recover the increased costs. The company anticipated aggressive pricing actions scheduled during the second half of fiscal 2005 to improve results, however, those pricing actions were not executed effectively. Also, manufacturing challenges resulting from the installation of new equipment, consolidation of plant locations and transfer of production across plant locations resulted in the disruption of the companys ability to fill customer orders for certain products, primarily in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2005 packaged meats operating profits decreased by approximately $150 million as compared to fiscal 2004. The company has made several changes within the packaged meats operations, including changes to strengthen leadership, and expects these changes, along with better pricing management, aggressive cost-savings initiatives and SKU reduction to improve the packaged meats operations over time.
Cost Reduction Efforts In fiscal 2004, the company identified specific operating efficiency initiatives as part of an effort to improve the companys cost structure, margins and competitive position. As a result of these specific initiatives, the company recognized incremental expenses of $21 million and $62 million during fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. The company does not anticipate additional costs associated with these initiatives.
In addition, the company undertook in fiscal 2005 the general and administrative and headcount reductions described above. The company recognized $43 million of severance expense during fiscal 2005 and does not anticipate significant additional costs in fiscal 2006 related to the headcount reduction. The company created and funded a Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Trust (VEBA) for the purpose of funding benefit payments to participants in the companys postretirement benefit plans and severance payments to employees terminated under the companys salaried headcount reduction. The company contributed $75 million to the VEBA in May 2005.
15 Divestitures During fiscal 2005, the company substantially completed the repositioning of its portfolio to focus on higher-margin, branded and value-added businesses through additional divestitures. Current year dispositions included the companys:  international crop inputs businesses (UAP International),  minority equity investment in Swift Foods and cattle feeding assets,  specialty meats foodservice business, and  Portuguese poultry business.
These divestitures, combined with prior years divestitures of the companys chicken business, U.S. and Canadian crop inputs businesses of United Agri Products (UAP North America), Spanish feed business, fresh beef and pork operations, canned seafood operations and cheese operations, substantially completed the multi-year program aimed at divesting the companys non-core businesses. The results of operations of the chicken business, UAP North America, UAP International, the Spanish feed business and Portuguese poultry business, and the specialty meats foodservice business are reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Beginning September 24, 2004, the results of operations of the cattle feeding business are presented in discontinued operations.
Capital Allocation During fiscal 2005, the company reduced its debt by almost $1.2 billion, reducing its debt to total capital ratio from 54% in fiscal 2004 to 48% in fiscal 2005 (total capital is defined as debt plus common stockholders equity). Included in fiscal 2005 results is a $22 million loss, reflected in selling, general and administrative expense, from the early retirement of certain debt. In addition, as part of the companys previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program, the company repurchased approximately 7 million shares at a total cost of $181 million. In fiscal 2004, the company repurchased 15 million shares at a total cost of $419 million. The company continues to assess its allocation of capital and periodically reviews the appropriateness and timing with respect to the continuation of the share repurchase program. The company paid dividends of $550 million and $537 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Inflation During fiscal 2005 and 2004, the companys commodity and other input costs, on average, were higher than those in prior years, resulting in higher cost of goods sold. For fiscal 2005 and 2004, inflation resulted in increased operating costs of more than $400 million and more than $350 million, respectively. The company was able to recover a portion of these increased costs through increased pricing and operational savings, but gross margins declined in fiscal 2005, particularly in the packaged meats operations.
Other Significant Items of Note The prior year included 53 weeks of operations while the current year includes 52 weeks as a result of the companys year-end being the last Sunday of May. The estimated impact on the companys results of operations due to the extra week in fiscal 2004 was additional net sales of approximately $281 million and additional segment operating profit of approximately $41 million.
During fiscal 2005, the company recognized:  two equity method investment impairment charges totaling $71 million, $66 million after tax,  a charge of $21.5 million in connection with the expected settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),  a benefit of $17 million for legal settlements in the Retail Products segment, 16  asset impairment charges totaling $25 million, $15 million after tax, relating to a Retail Products brand impairment as well as an impairment associated with a plant closure in the companys Food Ingredients segment,  the uninsured portion of a casualty loss of $10 million, $6 million after tax, resulting from a fire at an insured Foodservice Products processing facility, and  a pre-tax gain of approximately $186 million from the sale of ten million shares of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock in December 2004.
Opportunities and Challenges The company believes that its sales and marketing and operating initiatives will favorably influence future profits, profit margins and returns on capital. Because of the scope of change underway, there is risk in successfully implementing these broad change initiatives.
As described above, the company has made several changes to its retail and foodservice packaged meats businesses. The company expects these changes to improve the profitability of these operations over time. However, competitive pressures, input costs and the execution of the operational changes, among other factors, will affect the future profitability of these operations and the timing of any profit recovery.
The company is facing increased costs for many of its significant raw materials, packaging and energy inputs. When appropriate, the company uses long-term purchase contracts, futures and options to reduce the volatility of these costs. The company has also recently implemented sales price increases for certain products and will continue to evaluate further price increases based on raw material cost trends, expected impact on sales volumes and other factors.
Changing consumer preferences may impact sales of certain of the companys products. The company offers a variety of food products which appeal to a range of consumer preferences and utilizes innovation and marketing programs to develop products that fit with changing consumer trends. As part of these programs, the company introduces new products and product extensions.
Consolidation of many of the companys customers continues to result in increased buying power, negotiating strength and complex service requirements for those customers. This trend, which is expected to continue, may negatively impact gross margins, particularly in the Retail Products segment. In order to effectively respond to this customer consolidation, during fiscal 2004 the company consolidated its sales force to more efficiently service its customers. In fiscal 2003, the companys retail customer service centers were consolidated into one specialized facility to service all retail channel customers. The company continues to streamline its distribution network in order to reduce costs and increase its responsiveness to customer needs.
Restatement and Internal Control Remediation Matters During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2005, the company conducted reviews that led to the discovery of errors related to accounting for income taxes in previously reported amounts. To correct the errors discovered, the company restated financial statements for the periods covered in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 30, 2004 and the Forms 10-Q for the first two quarters of fiscal 2005. The company has evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over accounting for income taxes as of May 29, 2005, and has determined that the accounting errors referenced above and the potential for additional misstatements indicate a material weakness in internal control over accounting for income taxes. P rogress has been made in implementing managements plans to remediate the material weakness, including reorganization of the tax department, hiring of a new Vice President of Tax and other tax and tax accounting professionals, design of enhanced control processes over accounting for income taxes, implementation of certain enhanced control processes over accounting for income taxes, including general ledger account reconciliation processes, implementation of dual review procedures, and engagement of third party tax specialists to provide additional quality assurance. The company will continue implementing managements remediation plans and will monitor the improvements in the controls over accounting for income taxes to ensure remediation of the material weakness.
17 SEGMENT REVIEW The companys operations are organized into three reporting segments: Retail Products, Foodservice Products and Food Ingredients. The Retail Products reporting segment includes branded foods which are sold in various retail channels and includes frozen, refrigerated and shelf-stable temperature classes. The Foodservice Products reporting segment includes branded and customized food products, including meals, entrees, prepared potatoes, meats, seafood, sauces and a variety of custom-manufactured culinary products packaged for sale to restaurants and other foodservice establishments. The Food Ingredients reporting segment includes both branded and commodity food ingredients, including milled grain ingredients, seasonings, blends and flavorings, which are sold to food processors, as well as certain commodity trading and merchandising operations.
2005 vs. 2004 Net Sales ($in   millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2005 Net Sales Fiscal 2004 Net Sales % Increase/ (Decrease) Retail Products $ 8,669 $ 8,434 3 % Foodservice   Products 3,227 3,274 (1 )% Food Ingredients 2,671 2,374 13 % Total $ 14,567 $ 14,082 3 % Overall company net sales increased $485 million to $14.6 billion, primarily reflecting favorable results in the Food Ingredients segment and a 2% sales volume increase in the Retail Products segment. Fiscal 2004 results include an estimated $281 million of incremental net sales due to the inclusion of an additional week of operations. The company believes that its sales and marketing initiatives (discussed in the Executive Overview) continue to favorably influence brand growth.
Retail Products net sales increased $235 million for the year to $8.7 billion. Fiscal 2004 results include an estimated $165 million of incremental net sales due to the inclusion of an additional week of operations. Sales volume grew by 2% in fiscal 2005, led by gains in certain key frozen food brands. Sales of the companys top thirty brands, which represent approximately 80% of total segment sales, grew 4% as a group, as sales of some of the companys most significant brands, including Banquet, Chef Boyardee, Marie Callenders, Armour, ACT II, Kid Cuisine, Libbys, Blue Bonnet, PAM, Parkay, Egg Beaters, Swiss Miss, Snack Pack, Hunts, Cooks, Eckrich and Manwich, grew in fiscal 2005, despite the additional week included in results for fiscal 2004. Major brands posting sales declines for the year included Healthy Choice, Butterball, Slim Jim, Hebrew National, LaChoy and County Line. Although the sales and marketing initiatives previously discussed have positively impacted the Retail Products segment net sales for the year, manufacturing challenges resulting from installation of new equipment, consolidation of plant locations and transfer of production across plant locations, and temporary disruptions from the implementation of Project Nucleus , the companys information-based business process initiative, resulted in the disruption of the companys ability to fill customer orders for certain products, primarily in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 .
Net sales in the Foodservice Products segment were $3.2 billion, a decrease of $47 million. Fiscal 2004 results include an estimated $61 million of incremental net sales due to the inclusion of an additional week of operations and $28 million of sales from a business the company divested in fiscal 2004. Sales of specialty potato products increased due to strong volumes during fiscal 2005. However, these increases were more than offset by decreased sales volumes in the culinary and seafood product lines, resulting from manufacturing challenges similar to those discussed in the Retail Products segment discussion, above, as well as the impact of tariffs and related competitive impacts on the seafood product lines.
Food Ingredients net sales increased $297 million to $2.7 billion. Fiscal 2004 results include an estimated $55 18 million of incremental net sales due to the inclusion of an additional week of operations. The increase in sales was primarily driven by the growth in trading and merchandising operations, as well as the inclusion of sales to United Agri Products, Inc. and Pilgrims Pride Corporation subsequent to the companys divestitures of UAP North America and the chicken business in the third quarter of fiscal 2004.
Gross Profit (Net Sales less Cost of Goods Sold) ($in   millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2005 Gross Profit Fiscal 2004 Gross Profit % Increase/ (Decrease) Retail Products $ 2,159 $ 2,289 (6 )% Foodservice   Products 517 569 (9 )% Food Ingredients 426 348 22 % Total $ 3,102 $ 3,206 (3 )% The companys gross profit for fiscal 2005 was $3.1 billion, a decrease of $104 million, or 3%, from the prior year. Fiscal 2004 results include an estimated $60 million of incremental gross profit due to the inclusion of an additional week of operations. Gross profit was reduced by $17 million and $34 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively, due to costs incurred to implement the companys operational efficiency initiatives. Gross profits were negatively impacted by increased input costs, primarily in the packaged meats operations, coupled with ineffective pricing that did not recover the increased costs.
Retail Products gross profit for fiscal 2005 was $2.2 billion, a decrease of $130 million from fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2004 results include an estimated $42 million of incremental gross profit due to the inclusion of an additional week of operations. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives reduced gross profit by $13 million and $20 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Increased sales volume of 2% was more than offset by the impact of the increased input costs and ineffective product pricing, particularly in the retail packaged meats operations. The costs of installation of new equipment, consolidation of plant locations and transfer of production across plant locations also negatively impacted gross profit in fiscal 2005.
Foodservice Products gross profit for fiscal 2005 was $517 million, a decrease of $52 million over the prior fiscal year. Fiscal 2004 results include an estimated $11 million of incremental gross profit due to the inclusion of an additional week of operations. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives reduced gross profit by $4 million and $13 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Improved gross profit in the companys specialty potato products, due to increased sales volumes, was more than offset by increased input costs in the foodservice packaged meats operations, reduced sales volumes and margins in the seafood operations and unfavorable production costs associated with a planned plant consolidation.
The Food Ingredients segment generated gross profit of $426 million in fiscal 2005, an increase of $78 million over the prior fiscal year. Fiscal 2004 results include an estimated $7 million of incremental gross profit due to the inclusion of an additional week of operations. Improvements in gross profit are due to favorable market conditions in the companys commodity trading (including petroleum-based products) and fertilizer merchandising operations. The company does not expect to achieve this level of gross profits in its trading and merchandising operations in fiscal 2006. A difficult cost environment and competitive conditions continued to negatively impact the performance of dehydrated onion, garlic, capsicums, and vegetable-based food ingredients.
Reporting   Segment Fiscal 2005 Gross Margin Fiscal 2004 Gross Margin Retail Products 25 % 27 % Foodservice   Products 16 % 17 % Food Ingredients 16 % 15 % Total 21 % 23 % 19 The companys gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for fiscal 2005 decreased two percentage points as compared to fiscal 2004, which reflects the impact of higher input costs, combined with ineffective product pricing, principally in the packaged meats operations. The costs of installation of new equipment, consolidation of plant locations and transfer of production across plant locations, combined with the resulting disruption of the companys ability to fill customer orders for certain higher-margin products in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, also contributed to the reduced gross margin.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, includes General Corporate Expense (SG&A) SG&A expenses totaled $1.8 billion in both fiscal 2005 and 2004. Fiscal 2004 results include an estimated $34 million in SG&A expense for the inclusion of an additional week of operations. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives increased SG&A expenses by $4 million and $27 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. The company spent significantly less on advertising and promotion in fiscal 2005 than in the prior year. This reduction was more than offset by increased trade spending, which is reflected as a reduction of net sales. The company also incurred lower incentive compensation expense in fiscal 2005 than in the prior year. Included in fiscal 2005 SG&A expenses are:  charges for an impairment of a facility of $15 million in the Food Ingredients segment,  a charge of $22 million on the early redemption of $600 million of 7.5% senior debt,  a charge of $21.5 million in connection with matters related to an ongoing SEC investigation,  a $10 million charge to reflect an impairment of a brand within the Retail Products segment,  a benefit of $17 million for legal settlements in the Retail Products segment,  a fire loss at a Foodservice Products plant of $10 million, and  a charge of $43 million for severance expense in connection with the companys salaried headcount reduction actions.
The results for fiscal 2004 include $25 million of litigation expense related to a former choline chloride joint venture with E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. that was sold in 1997, partially offset by a gain of $21 million recognized upon the sale of the companys cost-method investment in a venture. In fiscal 2004, the company established reserves of $25 million in connection with matters related to an SEC investigation (see Legal Matters discussion).
Advertising and promotion expense was $344 million in fiscal 2005, below the $406 million spent in the prior year. The decline reflects the companys continued implementation of disciplined analyses to evaluate marketing investments as well as overall cost control. The companys marketing activities also include more than $2 billion spent with customers in the form of trade merchandising and trade promotions. Those amounts are reflected as a reduction of net sales in the companys consolidated statements of earnings.
Operating Profit (Earnings before general corporate expense, interest expense, net, gain on the sale of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock, income taxes and equity method investment earnings) ($in   millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2005 Operating Profit Fiscal 2004 Operating Profit % Increase/ (Decrease) Retail Products $ 1,129 $ 1,218 (7 )% Foodservice   Products 277 325 (15 )% Food Ingredients 263 197 34 % Retail Products operating profit decreased $89 million for the fiscal year to $1.1 billion. Fiscal 2004 results include 20 an estimated $28 million of incremental operating profit due to the inclusion of an additional week of operations. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives reduced operating profit by $15 million and $25 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Fiscal 2005 results reflect a $24 million charge in relation to the companys salaried headcount reduction, a benefit of $17 million for favorable legal settlements, and a $10 million charge for an impairment of a brand and related assets. The remaining decline in operating profit is reflective of reduced gross profit, as discussed above, partially offset by reduced expenditures for advertising and promotion.
Foodservice Products operating profit declined $48 million to $277 million. Fiscal 2004 results include an estimated $7 million of incremental operating profit due to the inclusion of an additional week of operations. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives reduced operating profit by $6 million and $29 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Fiscal 2005 results include a $10 million charge for a fire loss at a Canadian production facility and a $4 million charge in connection with the companys salaried headcount reduction. The remaining decrease in operating profit is due to decreased gross profit, as previously discussed.
Food Ingredients operating profit increased $66 million to $263 million, primarily reflecting improved gross profits, as discussed above. Fiscal 2004 results include an estimated $7 million of incremental operating profit due to the inclusion of an additional week of operations. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives reduced operating profit by $1 million and $8 million in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. Fiscal 2005 results include a $15 million charge for the impairment of a facility and a $4 million charge in connection with the companys salaried headcount reduction. The commodity trading and merchandising component of the Food Ingredients segment contributed $186 million and $99 million to operating profit for fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Interest Expense, Net In fiscal 2005, net interest expense was $295 million, an increase of $20 million, or 7%, over the prior fiscal year. Increased interest expense reflects a reduced benefit from the interest rate swap agreements terminated in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. These interest rate swap agreements were previously put in place as a strategy to hedge interest costs associated with long-term debt and were closed out in fiscal 2004 in order to lock-in existing favorable interest rates. For financial statement purposes, the benefit associated with the termination of the interest rate swap agreements continues to be recognized over the term of the debt instruments originally hedged. As a result, the companys net interest expense was reduced by $41 million during fiscal 2005 and $76 million during fiscal 2004. In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the company recognized approximately $14 million of additional interest expense associated with a previously terminated interest rate swap. The company had previously deferred this amount in accumulated other comprehensive income as the interest rate swap was being used to hedge the interest payments associated with the forecasted issuance of debt. During the second quarter, the company determined it was no longer probable such debt would be issued and immediately recognized the entire deferred amount within interest expense. The company also earned less interest income in fiscal 2005 due to the transaction with Swift Foods in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 in which the company took control and ownership of the net assets of the cattle feeding business, thereby terminating the line of credit provided by the company to Swift Foods. These factors have been partially offset by the companys retirement of nearly $1.2 billion of debt during fiscal 2005.
Gain on Sale of Pilgrims Pride Corporation Common Stock During fiscal 2005, the company sold ten million shares of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock for $283 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $186 million.
Equity Method Investment Earnings (Loss) Equity method investment earnings (loss) decreased to a $25 million loss in fiscal 2005 as compared to earnings of $44 million in fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2005, the company determined that the carrying value of its investments in two unrelated joint ventures were other than temporarily impaired and, therefore, recognized pre-tax impairment charges totaling $71 million ($66 million after tax). The extent of the impairments was determined based upon the companys assessment of the recoverability of its investments, including an assessment of the investees ability to sustain earnings which would justify the carrying amount of the investments. In September 2004, the company sold its minority interest equity investment in Swift Foods. Prior year results include approximately $16 million from the 21 companys investment in that joint venture. Income from the companys other equity method investments, which include potato processing and grain merchandising businesses, did not substantially change from their fiscal 2004 amounts.
Results of Discontinued Operations Loss from discontinued operations was $22 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2004, the company recognized income from discontinued operations of $97 million, net of tax. The year-over-year change primarily resulted from:  fiscal 2005 net pre-tax losses of approximately $52 million related to the disposal of the remaining assets of UAP International and a specialty meats facility, and the impairment of the remaining assets of the specialty meats business, partially offset by a $19 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the cattle feeding business,  fiscal 2004 pre-tax impairment charges of $27 million recognized to write-down the long-lived assets of the UAP International and Portuguese poultry operations to net realizable value,  net pre-tax income of $51 million recognized on the sales of the chicken business, UAP North America and the Spanish feed business in fiscal 2004, and  profitable operations at the chicken business and UAP North America during the six-month period of fiscal 2004 prior to the divestitures, versus net operating losses incurred at the UAP International, cattle feeding and specialty meats businesses in fiscal 2005.
The companys UAP North America and UAP International operations had a fiscal year-end of February, while the companys consolidated year-end is May. Historically, the results of UAP North America and UAP International have been reflected in the companys consolidated results on a three-month lag (e.g., UAPs results for December through February are included in the companys consolidated results for the period March through May). Due to the disposition of UAP North America in November 2003, a $24 million net-of-tax loss, representing the results for the three months ending November 2003, was recorded directly to retained earnings. If this business had not been divested, this net-of-tax loss would have been recognized in the companys fiscal 2004 consolidated statement of earnings. Due to the disposition of UAP International in April 2005, $2 million net-of-tax income, representing the results for the three months ending April 2005, was recorded directly to retained earnings. If this business had not been divested, this net-of-tax income would have been recognized in the companys fiscal 2005 and 2006 consolidated statements of earnings.
Income Taxes and Net Income The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 41% for fiscal 2005 and 37% in fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2005, the company increased its estimate of the effective tax rate for state income taxes, resulting in an overall effective tax rate in excess of the statutory rate. The company reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with respect to the IRSs examination of the companys tax returns for fiscal years 2000 through 2002. As a result of the resolution of these matters, the company reduced income tax expense and the related provision for income taxes payable by $5 million during fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2004, the company reached an agreement with the IRS with respect to the IRSs examination of the companys tax returns for fiscal years 1996 through 1999. As a result of the resolution of these matters, the company reduced income tax expense by $27 million in fiscal 2004. This was partially offset by the net tax impact related to the divestiture of certain foreign entities which increased income tax expense by approximately $21 million during fiscal 2004.
Net income was $642 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, in fiscal 2005, compared to $811 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, in fiscal 2004.
Legal Matters On June 22, 2001, the company filed an amended annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 28, 2000. The filing included restated financial information for fiscal years 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000. The restatement, due to accounting and conduct matters at United Agri Products, Inc. (UAP), a former subsidiary, was based upon an investigation undertaken by the company and the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors. The restatement was principally related to revenue recognition for deferred delivery sales and vendor rebates, advance vendor rebates and 22 bad debt reserves. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a formal order of nonpublic investigation dated September 28, 2001. The company is cooperating with the SEC investigation, which relates to the UAP matters described above, as well as other aspects of the companys financial statements, including the level and application of certain of the companys reserves.
The company is currently conducting discussions with the SEC Staff regarding a possible settlement of these matters. Based on discussions to date, the company estimates the amount of such settlement and related payments to be approximately $46.5 million. The company recorded charges of $25 million and $21.5 million in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005, respectively, in connection with these matters. There can be no assurance that the negotiations with the SEC Staff will ultimately be successful or that the SEC will accept the terms of any settlement that is negotiated with the SEC Staff. Accordingly, the terms of any settlement, if reached, could result in charges greater than the amount currently estimated and recognized in the companys financial statements.
On August 10, 2001, a purported class action lawsuit, Gebhardt v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et. al.
, Case No. 810CV427, was filed in United States District Court for Nebraska against the company and certain of its executive officers alleging violations of the federal securities laws in connection with the events resulting in the companys June 2001 restatement of its financial statements. The company reached an agreement, which received final approval by the court on May 24, 2005, to settle the lawsuit for $14 million. The settlement, which is largely covered by insurance, is without admission of liability or wrongdoing.
Derivative actions were filed by three shareholder plaintiffs, purportedly on behalf of the company, on September 26, 2001, in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware in New Castle County, Case No. 19130NC, and on October 9, 2001, in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska, Case No. 401CV3255.

The action sought, inter alia, recovery to the company, which was named as a nominal defendant in the action, of damages allegedly sustained by the company and a direction to the defendants to establish programs to prevent wrongful and illegal practices. The company has reached an agreement to settle the lawsuit for the cost of plaintiffs attorney fees of $0.3 million, which will be covered by insurance. The settlement includes certain undertakings and is without admission of liability or wrongdoing. The settlement was preliminarily approved by the court on June 13, 2005, and following completion of steps incident to the settlement process, will be submitted to the court for final approval.
On April 29, 2005, the company filed an amended annual report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended May 30, 2004 and amended quarterly reports on Form 10-Q/A for the quarters ended August 29, 2004 and November 28, 2004. The filings included restated financial information for fiscal years 2002, 2003, 2004 and the first two quarters of fiscal 2005. The restatement related to tax matters. In addition, the company is providing information to the SEC Staff relating to the facts and circumstances surrounding the restatement. On June 21, 2005, a purported class action, Berlien v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et. al.
, Case No. 805CV292 was filed in United States District Court for Nebraska, and on June 30, 2005, a purported class action, Calvacca v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et. al.
, Case No. 805CV00318 was filed in the same court. On July 26, 2005, a purported class action, Woods v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et. al ., Case No. 6707, was filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Each lawsuit is against the company and its chief executive officer. The lawsuits allege violations of the federal securities laws in connection with the events resulting in the companys April 2005 restatement of its financial statements relating to tax matters. Each complaint seeks a declaration that the action is maintainable as a class action and that the plaintiff is a proper class representative, unspecified compensatory damages, reasonable attorneys fees and any other relief deemed proper by the court. The company believes the lawsuits are without merit and plans to vigorously defend the actions.
On July 15, 2005, two derivative actions were filed by shareholder plaintiff Gerald Halpern, Case No. 805CV342, and shareholder plaintiff Shawn Van Hees, Case No. 805CV343, and on July 26, 2005 a derivative action was filed by shareholder plaintiff Charles Zimmerman, Case No. 405CV3183, purportedly on behalf of the company in United States District Court for Nebraska.

The action seeks, inter alia, recovery to the company, which was named as a nominal defendant in the action, of damages allegedly sustained by the company and for reimbursement and restitution. The officers and directors named as defendants in the action intend to vigorously defend 23 the allegations and believe the actions are without merit.
On July 18, 2005, purported class actions, Rantala v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et. al.
, Case No. 805CV349, and Bright v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et. al.

The lawsuits allege violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in connection with the events resulting in the companys April 2005 restatement of its financial statements and related matters. Each complaint seeks unspecified amount of damages, injunctive relief, attorneys fees and other equitable monetary relief. The company believes the lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend the actions.
2004 vs. 2003 Net Sales ($in   millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2004 Net Sales Fiscal 2003 Net Sales % Increase/ (Decrease) Retail Products $ 8,434 $ 8,668 (3 )% Foodservice   Products 3,274 3,193 3 % Food Ingredients 2,374 2,204 8 % Meat Processing  2,469 (100 )% Total $ 14,082 $ 16,534 (15 )% Overall fiscal 2004 net sales declined $2.5 billion to $14.1 billion, primarily reflecting the impact of the fresh beef and pork divestiture in fiscal 2003 and the sale of the canned seafood and processed cheese-related operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003 sales included approximately $3.1 billion from the divested businesses, while fiscal 2004 sales included none. These decreases were partially offset by the $281 million estimated impact on net sales of one additional week included in the results of operations for fiscal 2004.
Retail Products net sales declined $234 million in fiscal 2004 to $8.4 billion. Included in results for fiscal 2003 were net sales of $493 million from the canned seafood business, which was divested in fiscal 2003. This decrease was partially offset by the estimated impact of one additional week included in the results of operations for fiscal 2004, an increase to net sales of approximately $165 million. Sales of the companys key branded products showed mixed results, as sales of some of the companys most significant brands, including Banquet, Chef Boyardee, Wesson, Slim Jim, PAM, Egg Beaters and Reddi-wip, grew on a comparable fifty-two week basis. Major brands posting sales declines for the year included Healthy Choice, Butterball, Armour, ACT II and Orville Redenbachers. In addition to the sales and marketing initiatives previously discussed, new products and product extensions in the frozen meals and entrees category, such as Banquet Crock-Pot Classics and Life Choice, positively impacted the Retail Products segment net sales for the year. Weak sales volume in popcorn products, driven by intense competition in the category and consumer trends, negatively impacted the segments performance.
Net sales in the Foodservice Products segment were $3.3 billion, an increase of $81 million. Included in results for fiscal 2003 were net sales of $93 million from divested businesses. The estimated impact of the inclusion of one additional week of net sales in fiscal 2004 was an increase of approximately $61 million. Sales of specialty potato products and shelf-stable and specialty meats within the culinary product line achieved increased sales volumes during fiscal 2004. Improved unit pricing within the specialty potato and specialty meats products also contributed to increased net sales.
Food Ingredients net sales increased $170 million to $2.4 billion. The increase in sales was primarily driven by the pass-through of increases in commodity raw material costs, favorable results from commodity trading (including petroleum-based products) and merchandising and approximately $55 million related to the additional week in fiscal 2004.
24 Due to the fresh beef and pork divestiture, the Meat Processing segment includes no sales for fiscal 2004. Net sales in fiscal 2003 were $2.5 billion.
Gross Profit (Net Sales less Cost of Goods Sold) ($in   millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2004 Gross Profit Fiscal 2003 Gross Profit % Increase/ (Decrease) Retail Products $ 2,289 $ 2,455 (7 )% Foodservice   Products 569 558 2 % Food Ingredients 348 291 20 % Meat Processing  83 (100 )% Total $ 3,206 $ 3,387 (5 )% The companys gross profit for fiscal 2004 was $3.2 billion, a decrease of $181 million, or 5%, from the prior year. The decrease reflects $168 million of gross profit in fiscal 2003 related to businesses the company no longer owns and $34 million of costs incurred in fiscal 2004 to implement the companys operational efficiency initiatives and higher input costs, which were not fully offset by higher selling prices, offset by an estimated $60 million of gross profit related to the additional week in fiscal 2004.
Retail Products gross profit for fiscal 2004 was $2.3 billion, a decrease of $166 million from fiscal 2003. Included in the prior year gross profit was $75 million from the divested canned seafood operations. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives reduced gross profit by $20 million. The estimated impact of the inclusion of one extra week in fiscal year 2004 was an increase in gross profit of approximately $42 million. Additionally, the segments gross profit decreased due to a less favorable product mix, increased input costs, which were not fully offset by increased selling prices, primarily in packaged meats products and an extremely competitive environment for popcorn products.
Foodservice Products gross profit for fiscal 2004 was $569 million, an increase of $11 million over the prior fiscal year. Included in the prior year gross profit was $10 million from businesses divested in that year. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives reduced gross profit by $13 million. The estimated impact of the inclusion of one extra week in fiscal year 2004 was an increase of approximately $11 million.
The Food Ingredients segment generated gross profit of $348 million in fiscal 2004, an increase of $57 million over fiscal 2003. The estimated impact of the inclusion of one extra week in fiscal 2004 was an increase of approximately $7 million. Also favorably impacting fiscal 2004 gross profit was improved performance from certain value-added food ingredient businesses, which included a $22 million lower-of-cost or market adjustment to inventory in fiscal 2003 and better results for commodity trading and merchandising operations due to market volatility.
Gross profit in the Meat Processing segment was $83 million in fiscal 2003.
Reporting   Segment Fiscal 2004 Gross Margin Fiscal 2003 Gross Margin Retail Products 27 % 28 % Foodservice   Products 17 % 17 % Food Ingredients 15 % 13 % Meat Processing  3 % Total 23 % 20 % The companys gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for fiscal 2004 increased three percentage points as compared to fiscal 2003, which reflects the companys divestitures of low margin operations and 25 improvement in value-added food ingredient products, offset by the impact of higher input costs, which were not fully offset by selling price increases, principally in the Retail Products segment.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, includes General Corporate Expense SG&A expenses decreased $83 million, or 4%, to $1.8 billion for fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2003 SG&A expenses included approximately $10 million from divested businesses and $38 million of transaction costs related to the fresh beef and pork divestiture. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives increased SG&A expenses by $27 million in fiscal 2004. The estimated impact of the inclusion of one extra week in fiscal 2004 was an increase of approximately $34 million. The results for fiscal 2004 include $25 million of litigation expense related to a former choline chloride joint venture with E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. that was sold in 1997. In addition, in fiscal 2004 the company established a $25 million reserve in connection with matters related to an SEC investigation (see Legal Matters). These items were partially offset by a gain of $21 million recognized upon the sale of the companys cost-method investment in a venture. Lower selling costs, marketing-related costs and various other legal and insurance costs resulted in a favorable comparison with fiscal 2003.
Operating Profit (Earnings before general corporate expense, interest expense, net, income taxes and equity method investment earnings) ($in   millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2004 Operating Profit Fiscal 2003 Operating Profit % Increase/ (Decrease) Retail Products $ 1,218 $ 1,298 (6 )% Foodservice   Products 325 371 (12 )% Food Ingredients 197 125 58 % Meat Processing  99 (100 )% Retail Products operating profit decreased $80 million for fiscal 2004 to $1.2 billion. Included in fiscal 2003 operating profit was $43 million from the divested canned seafood operations. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives decreased operating profit by $25 million. The estimated impact of the inclusion of one extra week in fiscal 2004 was an increase of $28 million. The remaining decline in operating profit is reflective of reduced gross profit, due to increased input costs, which were not fully offset by increased selling prices, primarily in refrigerated meat products, an extremely competitive environment in popcorn products and a less favorable mix of products.
Foodservice Products operating profit declined $46 million to $325 million. Included in fiscal 2003 operating profit was $6 million from businesses divested in that year. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives decreased operating profit by $29 million. The estimated impact of the inclusion of one extra week in fiscal 2004 was an increase of $7 million. Increased gross profits were largely offset by significantly higher SG&A expenses related to information systems implementation costs.
Food Ingredients operating profit increased $72 million to $197 million, primarily reflecting improved gross profits, as discussed above. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives decreased operating profit by $8 million. The estimated impact of the inclusion of one extra week in fiscal 2004 was an increase of $7 million.
The Meat Processing segment generated operating profit of $99 million in fiscal 2003.
Interest Expense, Net In fiscal 2004, net interest expense was $275 million, unchanged from the prior fiscal year. During fiscal 2004, the company closed out all $2.5 billion of its interest rate swap agreements. Of the $2.5 billion interest rate swaps 26 closed out in fiscal 2004, $2.0 billion of the interest rate swaps had been used to effectively convert certain of the companys fixed rate debt into floating rate debt. The remaining $500 million portion of the companys interest rate swaps was used to hedge certain of the companys forecasted interest payments on floating rate debt for the period from 2005 through 2011. For financial statement and tax purposes, the proceeds received upon termination of the interest rate swap agreements will be recognized over the term of the debt instruments originally hedged.
Equity Method Investment Earnings Equity method investment earnings decreased to $44 million in fiscal 2004 from $46 million in fiscal 2003. This reflects decreased earnings from an investment in a South American joint venture, offset by higher profits due to a full year of results of the companys minority ownership in the fresh beef and pork joint venture established following the companys fresh beef and pork divestiture in September 2002. Income from the companys other equity method investments, which includes barley malting, potato processing and grain merchandising, did not substantially change from their fiscal 2003 amounts.
Results of Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations was $97 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2003, the company recognized a net-of-tax loss from discontinued operations of $52 million. The year-over-year change primarily resulted from:  a fiscal 2003 pre-tax charge of approximately $112 million related to lowering asset values in connection with the then pending chicken business sale,  net pre-tax income of $51 million recognized on the sales of the chicken business, UAP North America and the Spanish feed business in fiscal 2004,  a fiscal 2003 charge of $24 million resulting from the reduction of values of certain refrigerated meat inventory,  fiscal 2004 pre-tax impairment charges of $27 million recognized to write-down the long-lived assets of the UAP International and Portuguese poultry operations to net realizable value, and  significantly improved gross margins at the chicken business and UAP North America during the six-month period of fiscal 2004 prior to the divestitures, relative to those generated in fiscal 2003, due to industry-wide improvements in the markets for their products.
The companys UAP North America operations had a fiscal year-end of February, while the companys consolidated year-end is May. Historically, the results of UAP North America have been reflected in the companys consolidated results on a three-month lag (e.g., UAP North Americas results for June through August are included in the companys consolidated results for the period September through November). Due to the disposition of UAP North America on November 23, 2003, UAP North Americas results for the three months ending November 23, 2003, a net-of-tax loss of $24 million, was recorded directly to retained earnings. If this business had not been divested, this net-of-tax loss would have been recognized in the companys fiscal 2004 consolidated statement of earnings. The comparable amount recorded in income (loss) from discontinued operations for the three-month period ended November 24, 2002 was a loss of $20 million.
Income Taxes and Net Income The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 37% for fiscal 2004 and 35% in fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2004, the company reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with respect to the IRSs examination of the companys tax returns for fiscal years 1996 through 1999. As a result of the resolution of these matters, the company reduced income tax expense by $27 million. This was partially offset by the net tax impact related to the divestiture of certain foreign entities which increased income tax expense by approximately $21 million during fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2003, the company divested its fresh beef and pork operations. As a result, the company generated foreign tax credits in excess of the taxable gain generated from the transaction. This resulted in a decrease of approximately 4% in the companys effective tax rate below the statutory tax rate in fiscal 2003.
27 Net income was $811 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, in fiscal 2004, compared to $764 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, in fiscal 2003.
LIQUDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sources of Liquidity and Capital The companys primary financing objective is to maintain a prudent balance sheet that provides the flexibility to pursue its growth objectives. The company currently uses short-term debt to finance increases in its trade working capital (accounts receivable plus inventory, less accounts payable, accrued expenses and advances on sales) needs and a combination of equity and long-term debt to finance both its base trade working capital needs and its noncurrent assets.
Commercial paper borrowings (usually less than 30 days maturity) are reflected in the companys consolidated balance sheets within notes payable. The company maintains a $1.05 billion revolving credit line as a backup to the companys commercial paper program. The company has never used the revolving credit facility. The company is in compliance with the credit agreements financial covenants. Management believes the company will maintain its current commercial paper rating for the foreseeable future, thus allowing the companys continued issuance of commercial paper. If the company were unable to access the short-term commercial paper market, the company could use its bank revolving credit facility to provide liquidity.
The companys $1.05 billion revolving credit facility (expiring in May 2007) is with major domestic and international banks. The interest rates for the revolving credit facilities are generally .30 to .35 percentage points higher than the interest rates for commercial paper.
The company determined that it did not require the availability of its $400 million accounts receivable securitization program and terminated this program in fiscal 2005. Under this program, accounts receivable could be sold without recourse at a discount, and the cost was included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Because these accounts receivable were sold without recourse to unrelated third parties, accounts receivable balances sold were excluded from the companys consolidated financial statements. As of the end of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 the company had no outstanding accounts receivable sold.
The companys overall level of interest-bearing debt totaled $4.5 billion at the end of fiscal 2005, compared to $5.7 billion as of the end of fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2005, the company retired $600 million of 7.5% senior debt and $175 million of preferred securities of a subsidiary company in advance of their respective dates of maturity. The company also made scheduled payments of maturing long-term debt of $385 million. The company also reduced its notes payable borrowings by $22 million during 2005. As of the end of both fiscal 2005 and 2004, the companys senior debt ratings were BBB+ (Fitch), Baa1 (Moodys) and BBB+ (Standard & Poors), all investment grade ratings.
The company also has a shelf registration under which it could issue from time to time up to $4 billion in debt securities.
Over the last three fiscal years, the company has divested its major commodity operations, such as fresh beef and pork, cheese processing, canned seafood, chicken processing and agricultural chemical distribution. The company received debt and equity interests as part of the proceeds for certain of those businesses.
During fiscal 2005, the company sold its equity interest in the fresh beef and pork venture for $194 million. The company also reached an agreement with affiliates of Swift Foods by which the company took control and ownership of the cattle feeding business (including feedlots and live cattle), and on October 15, 2004, the company sold the feedlots to Smithfield Foods, Inc. for approximately $70 million. The company retained live cattle inventory and related derivative instruments of approximately $255 million and liquidated those assets during fiscal 2005.
28 During fiscal 2005, the company sold substantially all of the remaining assets of UAP International for total proceeds of $43 million. Also, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the company implemented a plan to exit the specialty meats foodservice business. The company closed a manufacturing facility in Alabama, sold its operations in California, and in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, finalized a sale of its operations in Illinois. Sales proceeds from the California and Illinois facilities were $14 million and $10 million, respectively.
In fiscal 2005, the company sold the remaining $35 million of the UAP Preferred Securities and accrued dividends for cash. In December 2004, the company sold 10 million shares of Pilgrim's Pride Corporation common stock for $283 million, recognizing a gain of $186 million.
In August 2005 (fiscal 2006), the company sold its remaining 15.4 million shares of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock to that company for $482 million. The company will recognize a pre-tax gain of approximately $333 million, which will be subject to federal and state income tax, in its first quarter of fiscal 2006.
The company continues to evaluate opportunities to sell its $150 million subordinated notes receivable plus accrued interest of $35 million from the fresh beef and pork divestiture (which are reflected at a combined current fair market value of $147 million in the companys balance sheet at May 29, 2005).
Cash Flows In fiscal 2005, the company used $401 million of cash, which was the net impact of $1.1 billion generated from operating activities, $301 million generated from investing activities and $1.8 billion used in financing activities.
Cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled $837 million for fiscal 2005 as compared to $706 million generated in fiscal 2004. The increased cash flow was primarily due to a decrease of $470 million in amounts sold under the accounts receivable securitization program in fiscal 2004, partially offset by an increase in working capital in fiscal 2005. Cash generated from operating activities of discontinued operations was approximately $271 million in fiscal 2005, as compared to cash used of $125 million in fiscal 2004. The increased cash flows from operations of discontinued operations primarily reflect the sale of the inventory of the discontinued cattle feeding business. Cash flow from operating activities is one of the companys primary sources of liquidity.
Cash generated from investing activities totaled $301 million for fiscal 2005, versus cash generated from investing activities of $684 million in fiscal 2004. Investing activities for fiscal 2005 include proceeds from the sale of ten million shares of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock for $282 million, proceeds of $194 million from the sale of the companys remaining interest in Swift Foods, and other proceeds from other asset divestitures, offset by capital expenditures of $453 million. Investing activities for fiscal 2004 consisted primarily of proceeds of approximately $935 million from the divestitures of the chicken business, UAP North America and the Spanish feed business, partially offset by capital expenditures of $349 million.
Cash used in financing activities totaled $1.8 billion in fiscal 2005, as compared to cash used of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2005, the company retired $600 million of 7.5% senior debt and $175 million of preferred securities of a subsidiary company in advance of their respective dates of maturity. The company also made scheduled payments of maturing long-term debt of $385 million. The company also paid dividends of $550 million 29 and repurchased $181 million of its common stock as part of its share repurchase program. During fiscal 2004, the company repaid debt of $515 million, paid dividends of $537 million and repurchased shares of its outstanding common stock for $419 million.
The company estimates its capital expenditures in fiscal 2006 will be approximately $400 million. Management believes that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing credit facilities and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, additional share repurchases and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The company uses off-balance sheet arrangements (e.g., operating leases) where the economics and sound business principles warrant their use. The company periodically enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. These are described further in Obligations and Commitments below.
The company has used off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with the securitization and sale of trade receivables generated in the ordinary course of business. During fiscal 2005, the company terminated its accounts receivable securitization program. As of the end of fiscal 2005 and 2004, the company did not have any outstanding accounts receivable sold.
As a result of adopting FIN 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities , the company has consolidated the assets and liabilities of several entities from which it leases property, plant and equipment. The company also deconsolidated ConAgra Capital, L.C., an indirectly controlled subsidiary of the company, resulting in the removal of the preferred securities of subsidiary company of $175 million and the addition of $221 million of long-term debt and $46 million in other assets in the companys balance sheet as of May 30, 2004. The company redeemed the preferred securities of ConAgra Capital, L.C. in December 2004. Due to the adoption of FIN 46R, the company reflects in its balance sheet: property, plant and equipment, net of $214 million and $221 million, long-term debt of $223 million and $419 million, other noncurrent liabilities of $6 million and $25 million and other assets of $12 million and $46 million, as of May 29, 2005 and May 30, 2004, respectively. The company has no other material obligations arising out of variable interests with unconsolidated entities.
OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS As part of its ongoing operations, the company enters into arrangements that obligate the company to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements, debt agreements and unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as take-or-pay contracts). The unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into by the company in its normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available to the company. Of these items, capital lease and debt obligations, which total $4.5 billion, are currently recognized as liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations, which total $1 billion, are not recognized as liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
30 A summary of the companys contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2005 is as follows (including obligations of discontinued operations): Payments Due   by Period (in millions) Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 Years Long-Term Debt $ 4,512.1 $ 117.3 $ 538.3 $ 36.9 $ 3,819.6 Lease Obligations 740.6 103.4 200.5 125.8 310.9 Purchase Obligations 287.7 77.5 132.4 45.6 32.2 Total $ 5,540.4 $ 298.2 $ 871.2 $ 208.3 $ 4,162.7 The companys total obligations of approximately $5.5 billion reflect a decrease of approximately $1.0 billion from the companys 2004 fiscal year-end. The decrease was primarily a result of the repayment of certain long-term debt during fiscal 2005.
The company is also contractually obligated to pay interest on its long-term debt obligations. The weighted average interest rate of the long-term debt obligations outstanding as of May 29, 2005 was approximately 7.4%.
As part of its ongoing operations, the company also enters into arrangements that obligate the company to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event (e.g., guarantee debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform). In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet. A summary of the companys commitments, including commitments associated with equity method investments, as of the end of fiscal 2005, is as follows (including obligations of discontinued operations): Amount of   Commitment Expiration Per Period (in millions) Other Commercial Commitments Total Less than 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 Years Guarantees $ 57.9 $ 7.9 $ 21.5 $ 10.1 $ 18.4 Other Commitments 5.5 5.1 0.4   Total $ 63.4 $ 13.0 $ 21.9 $ 10.1 $ 18.4 The companys total commitments of approximately $63 million include approximately $38 million in guarantees and other commitments the company has made on behalf of the companys divested fresh beef and pork business.
As part of the fresh beef and pork transaction, the company assigned a hog purchase contract to the divested fresh beef and pork business which has indemnified the company for all liabilities under the contract. The company has guaranteed the performance of the divested fresh beef and pork business with respect to the hog purchase contract. The hog purchase contract requires the divested fresh beef and pork business to purchase a minimum of approximately 1.2 million hogs annually through 2014. The contract stipulates minimum price commitments, based in part on market prices, and in certain circumstances also includes price adjustments based on certain inputs.
31 TRADING ACTIVITIES The company accounts for certain contracts (e.g., physical commodity purchase/sale contracts and derivative contracts) at fair value. The company considers a portion of these contracts to be its trading activities; specifically, those contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , and its related amendment, SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities (collectively SFAS No. 133). The table below summarizes the changes in trading assets and liabilities for fiscal 2005: (in   millions) Net asset   outstanding as of May 30, 2004, at fair value $ 26.6 Contracts   settled during the period 1 (103.7 ) Changes in fair   value of contracts outstanding as of May 29, 2005 2 85.4 Changes   attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions  Net asset   outstanding as of May 29, 2005, at fair value $ 8.3 1 Includes contracts outstanding at May 30, 2004, and contracts entered into and settled during fiscal 2005.
2 Includes option premiums paid and received.
The following table represents the fair value and scheduled maturity dates of contracts outstanding as of May 29, 2005: Fair Value of Contracts as of May 29, 2005 net asset / (liability) (in   millions) Source of Fair Value Maturity less than 1 year Maturity 1 - 3 years Total Fair Value Prices actively   quoted (i.e., exchange-traded contracts) $ (0.7 ) $ 5.2 $ 4.5 Prices provided   by other external sources (i.e., non-exchange-traded contracts) 3.8  3.8 Prices based on   other valuation models (i.e., non-exchange-traded contracts)    Total fair value $ 3.1 $ 5.2 $ 8.3 In order to minimize the risk of loss associated with non-exchange-traded transactions with counterparties, the company utilizes established credit limits and performs ongoing counterparty credit evaluations.
The above tables exclude commodity-based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, including physical contracts to buy or sell commodities at agreed-upon fixed prices, as well as derivative contracts (e.g., futures and options) used primarily to hedge an existing asset or liability (e.g., inventory) or an anticipated transaction (e.g., purchase of inventory). The use of such contracts is not considered by the company to be trading activities as these contracts are considered either normal purchase and sale contracts or hedging contracts.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management. The estimates used by management are based on the companys historical experiences combined with managements understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the companys accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results and require significant or complex 32 judgment on the part of management. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management of the company.
The companys Audit Committee has reviewed the development, selection and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates.
Marketing Costs The company incurs certain costs to promote its products through marketing programs which include advertising, retailer incentives and consumer incentives. The company expenses each of these types of marketing costs in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting literature. The judgment required in determining when marketing costs are incurred can be significant. For volume-based incentives provided to retailers, management must continually assess the likelihood of the retailer achieving the specified targets. Similarly, for consumer coupons, management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future. Estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on the companys historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends. As these factors change, managements estimates could change and the company could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time. Advertising and promotion expenses totaled $344 million and $406 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively.
The company enters into over 150,000 individual marketing programs annually resulting in approximately $3 billion in annual costs. Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any of the individual marketing programs would not result in a material change in the companys results of operations or cash flows.
Income Taxes The company recognizes current tax liabilities and assets based on an estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current year for each of the jurisdictions in which the company transacts business. As part of the determination of its current tax liability, management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating positions taken by the company in its tax returns. The company has established reserves for probable tax exposures. These reserves, included in current tax liabilities, represent the companys estimate of amounts expected to be paid, which the company adjusts over time as more information regarding tax audits becomes available.
The company also recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences (e.g., book depreciation versus tax depreciation). If appropriate, the company recognizes valuation allowances to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be ultimately realized, based on the companys assessment of estimated future taxable income, including the consideration of available tax planning strategies.
The calculation of current and deferred tax assets (including valuation allowances) and liabilities requires management to apply significant judgment related to the application of complex tax laws, changes in tax laws or related interpretations, uncertainties related to the outcomes of tax audits and changes in the companys operations or other facts and circumstances. Further, management must continually monitor changes in these factors. Changes in such factors may result in changes to management estimates and could require the company to adjust its tax assets and liabilities and record additional income tax expense or benefits.
Environmental Liabilities Environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated. Management works with independent third-party specialists in order to effectively assess the companys environmental liabilities. Management estimates the companys environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required cleanup, the known volumetric contribution of the company and other potentially responsible parties and its experience in remediating sites. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup. Managements estimate as to its potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements. Insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims. The company does not discount its environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable. To the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above, managements estimate of environmental liabilities may also change.
33 The company has recognized a reserve of approximately $111 million for environmental liabilities as of May 29, 2005. Historically, the underlying assumptions utilized by the company in estimating this reserve have been appropriate as actual payments have not differed materially from the previously estimated reserve balances, nor have significant adjustments to this reserve balance been necessary. The reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy.
Employment-Related Benefits The company incurs certain employment-related expenses associated with pensions, postretirement health care benefits and workers compensation. In order to measure the expense associated with these employment-related benefits, management must make a variety of estimates including discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities, assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses, compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, anticipated health care costs and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to the company. The estimates used by management are based on the companys historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. The company uses third-party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employment-related benefits. Different estimates used by management could result in the company recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time.
The company recognized pension expense of $71 million, $76 million and $84 million in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which reflected expected returns on plan assets of $131 million, $127 million and $113 million, respectively. The company contributed $9 million, $66 million and $233 million to the companys pension plans in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The company anticipates contributing $37 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2006.
One of the significant assumptions used to account for the companys pension plans is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In developing the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense, the company considers long-term historical returns (arithmetic average) of the plans investments, the asset allocation among types of investments, estimated long-term returns by investment type from external sources, and the current economic environment. Based on this information, the company selected 7.75% for the long-term rate of return on plan assets for determining its fiscal 2005 pension expense. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the companys expected long-term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2005 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for the companys pension plans by approximately $4 million. The company selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% to be used to determine its pension expense for fiscal 2006.
When calculating expected return on plan assets for pension plans, the company uses a market-related value of assets that spreads asset gains and losses (differences between actual return and expected return) over five years. As of May 29, 2005, the amount of unrecognized losses in company pension plans was $213 million. These unrecognized losses included unrecognized losses on plan assets of $127 million and other unrecognized actuarial losses of $86 million. The amount of net unrecognized losses will change each year as the actual return on plan assets varies from the expected rate of return and as other factors vary from actuarial assumptions used to estimate the expense. Assuming no further change in the unrecognized losses in future periods, these losses would be recognized in future years resulting in an increase in pension expense of $9 million in fiscal 2006.
Another significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate. The company selects a discount rate each year for its plans based upon a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the year-by-year, projected benefit cash flows for the companys pension plans. The hypothetical bond portfolio is comprised of high-quality fixed income debt instruments (usually Moodys Aa) available at the measurement date. Based on this information, the discount rates selected by the company for determination of pension expense for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 were 6.0%, 6.5% and 7.25%, respectively. The company selected a discount rate of 5.75% for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2006. This 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate is expected to increase pension expense by $9 million but to result in no incremental company contributions to the pension plans in fiscal 2006. A 25 basis point increase in the companys discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2005 would decrease pension expense for the companys pension plans by 34 $3 million for the year.
A 25 basis point decrease in the companys discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2005 would increase pension expense for the companys pension plans by $7 million for the year. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense by approximately $9 million for fiscal 2006. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately $9 million for fiscal 2006. For its year-end pension obligation determination, the company selected 5.75% and 6.0% for fiscal year 2005 and 2004, respectively.
The rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans. The company determines this assumption based on its long-term plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions. Based on this information, the company selected 4.5% for fiscal 2005 and 2004 as the rate of compensation increase for determining its year-end pension obligation. The company selected 4.5% for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2005. A 25 basis point increase in the companys rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2005 would increase pension expense for the companys pension plans by approximately $3 million for the year. A 25 basis point decrease in the companys rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2005 would decrease pension expense for the companys pension plans by approximately $2 million for the year. The company selected a rate of 4.25% for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine its pension expense for fiscal 2006. The 25 basis point decrease in the fiscal 2006 rate of compensation increase as compared to the fiscal 2005 rate is expected to decrease pension expense by $2 million in fiscal 2006.
The company also provides certain postretirement health care benefits. The postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on the companys assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts. These assumptions include discount rates (discussed above), health care cost trend rates, inflation rates, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. The health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. Assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The discount rate selected by the company for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 was 6.0%, 6.5% and 7.25%, respectively. The company has selected a discount rate of 5.5% for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2006. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the companys discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2006 would decrease/increase postretirement expense for the companys plans by $1 million. The company has assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 10%, with the trend rate decreasing to 5% by 2011. A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effect: ($in   millions) One Percent Increase One Percent Decrease Effect on total   service and interest cost $ 2.7 $ (2.8 ) Effect on   postretirement benefit obligation 32.7 (29.2 ) The company provides workers compensation benefits to its employees. The measurement of the liability for the companys cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs. One significant assumption made by the company is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of its obligation. The discount rate used at May 29, 2005 was 5.5%. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers compensation expense.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (including property, plant and equipment), Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets The company reduces the carrying amounts of long-lived assets, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts (i.e., assets are deemed to be impaired). Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires the company to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset(s) being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, the company considers historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by the company in such 35 areas as future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions, product pricing and necessary capital expenditures. The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts (or none at all) for long-lived assets, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.
The company utilizes a relief from royalty methodology in evaluating impairment of its brands/trademarks. The methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate the company would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand. As the calculated fair value of the companys goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets significantly exceeds the carrying amount of these assets, a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the companys goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets would not result in a material impairment charge.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share-Based Payment . SFAS No. 123R will require the company to measure the cost of all employee stock-based compensation awards based on the grant date fair value of those awards and to record that cost as compensation expense over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award (generally over the vesting period of the award). Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have an impact on the companys results of operations, although it will have no impact on the companys overall financial position. SFAS No. 123R is effective beginning in the companys first quarter of fiscal 2007. Management is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this statement will have on the companys consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 . SFAS No. 151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Inventory Pricing , for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage), requiring that those items be recognized as current-period expenses. This statement also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The statement is effective for inventory costs incurred beginning in the companys fiscal 2007. Management is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this statement will have on the companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29 . APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions , is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. SFAS No. 153 amends APB Opinion No. 29, eliminating the exception to fair value accounting for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets, and replaces it with a general exception to fair value accounting for nonmonetary exchanges that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. The statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. Management does not expect this statement to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS ConAgra Foods enters into many lease agreements for land, buildings and equipment at competitive market rates, and some of the lease arrangements are with Opus Corporation or its affiliates. A director of ConAgra Foods is a beneficial owner, officer and director of Opus Corporation. The agreements relate to the leasing of land and buildings for ConAgra Foods. ConAgra Foods occupies the buildings pursuant to long-term leases with Opus Corporation and its affiliates, some of which contain various termination rights and purchase options. Leases effective in fiscal 2005 required annual lease payments by ConAgra Foods of $19.8 million. As a result of adopting FIN 46R, the company has consolidated certain of the Opus affiliates from which it leases property, plant and equipment.These leases were previously accounted for as operating leases. Opus Corporation or its affiliates were paid $52.9 million for construction work during fiscal 2005 on properties leased by ConAgra Foods from third parties. Opus Corporation had revenues in 36 excess of $1.25 billion in 2004.

ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The principal market risks affecting the company are exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs, interest rates and foreign currencies. These fluctuations impact raw material costs of all reporting segments, as well as the companys trading activities.
Commodities The company purchases commodity inputs such as wheat, corn, oats, soybean meal, soybean oil, meat, dairy products, sugar, energy and packaging materials to be used in its operations. These commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create gross margin risk. The company enters into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments. ConAgra Foods has policies governing the hedging instruments its businesses may use. These policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of its businesses. The company also monitors the amount of associated counter-party credit risk for all non-exchange-traded transactions. In addition, the company purchases and sells certain commodities, such as wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, oats and energy, in its trading operations. The companys trading activities are limited in terms of maximum dollar exposure, as measured by a dollar-at-risk methodology and monitored to ensure compliance.
The following table presents one measure of market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis is the measurement of potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in market prices. Actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes. In practice, as markets move, the company actively manages its risk and adjusts hedging strategies as appropriate. Fair value was determined using quoted market prices and was based on the companys net derivative position by commodity at each quarter-end during the fiscal year. The market risk exposure analysis excludes the underlying commodity positions that are being hedged. The commodities hedged have a high inverse correlation to price changes of the derivative commodity instrument.
37 Effect of 10% change in market prices: (in   millions) 2005 2004 Processing   Activities Grains High $ 16.3 $ 18.3 Low 9.5 2.1 Average 12.3 11.3 Meats High 22.8 1.0 Low 0.3  Average 7.2 0.6 Energy High 32.3 9.7 Low 18.6  Average 24.8 3.9 Trading   Activities Grains High 22.6 35.7 Low 14.8 21.0 Average 17.5 28.9 Meats High 16.3 3.0 Low 0.9 1.5 Average 5.4 2.2 Energy High 80.9 7.5 Low   Average 20.8 1.9 Interest Rates The company may use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on its existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of debt. At the end of fiscal 2005 and 2004, the company did not have any interest rate swap agreements outstanding, as all of the companys interest rate swap agreements were terminated in the second quarter of fiscal 2004.
As of May 29, 2005 and May 30, 2004, the fair value of the companys fixed rate debt was estimated at $5.2 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively, based on current market rates primarily provided by outside investment advisors. As of May 29, 2005 and May 30, 2004, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the companys fixed rate debt by approximately $344 million and $336 million, respectively, while a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the companys fixed rate debt by approximately $394 million and $387 million, respectively. With respect to floating rate debt, a one percentage point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the companys reported interest expense.
Foreign Operations In order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the company may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of its processing and trading operations. This activity primarily relates to hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory, capital equipment, sales of finished goods and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
The following table presents one measure of market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis for the companys processing and trading operations. Sensitivity analysis is the measurement of potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in exchange rates. Actual changes in exchange rates may differ from 38 hypothetical changes. Fair value was determined using quoted exchange rates and was based on the companys net foreign currency position at each quarter-end during the fiscal year. The market risk exposure analysis excludes the underlying foreign denominated transactions that are being hedged. The currencies hedged have a high inverse correlation to exchange rate changes of the foreign currency derivative instrument.

44 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Fiscal years ended May 29, 2005, May 30, 2004 and May 25, 2003 Columnar Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Fiscal Year The fiscal year of ConAgra Foods, Inc. (ConAgra Foods or the company) ends the last Sunday in May. The fiscal years for the consolidated financial statements presented consist of a 52-week period for fiscal year 2005, a 53-week period for fiscal year 2004 and a 52-week period for fiscal year 2003.
Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ConAgra Foods and all majority-owned subsidiaries. In addition, the accounts of all variable interest entities for which the company is determined to be the primary beneficiary are included in the companys consolidated financial statements from the date such determination is made. All significant intercompany investments, accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries - The investments in and the operating results of 50%-or-less-owned entities not required to be consolidated are included in the financial statements on the basis of the equity method of accounting or the cost method of accounting, depending on specific facts and circumstances.
Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition, including short-term time deposits, government agency and corporate obligations, are classified as cash and cash equivalents.
Inventories The company principally uses the lower of cost (determined using the first-in, first-out method) or market for valuing inventories not hedged. Grain, flour and major feed ingredient inventories are hedged to the extent practicable and are principally stated at market, including adjustment to market of open contracts for purchases and sales.
Property, Plant and Equipment - Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation has been calculated using primarily the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective classes of assets as follows: Land   improvements 1 - 40 years Buildings 15 - 40 years Machinery and   equipment 3 - 20 years Furniture,   fixtures, office equipment and other 5 - 15 years The company reviews property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability of an asset considered held-and-used is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the asset. If the carrying amount is greater than the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, the assets carrying amount is reduced to its estimated fair value. An asset considered held-for-sale is reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets Goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives (e.g., brands or trademarks) are not amortized and are tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired. Impairment occurs when the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. If impaired, the assets carrying amount is reduced to its fair value. The companys annual impairment testing is performed during the fourth quarter using a discounted cash flow-based methodology.
Identifiable intangible assets with definite lives (e.g., licensing arrangements with contractual lives or customer lists) are 45 amortized over their estimated useful lives and tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired. Impairment occurs when the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. If impaired, the asset is written down to its fair value.
Derivative Instruments The company uses derivatives (e.g., futures and options) for the purpose of hedging exposure to changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The fair value of each derivative is recognized in the balance sheet within current assets or current liabilities. For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized immediately in the statement of earnings. For derivatives designated as a hedge of an existing asset or liability (e.g., inventory), both the derivative and hedged item are recognized at fair value within the balance sheet with the changes in both of these fair values being recognized immediately in the statement of earnings. For derivatives designated as a hedge of an anticipated transaction (e.g., future purchase of inventory), changes in the fair value of the derivatives are deferred in the balance sheet within accumulated other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effective in mitigating the exposure to the related anticipated transaction. Any ineffectiveness associated with the hedge is recognized immediately in the statement of earnings. Amounts deferred within accumulated other comprehensive income are recognized in the statement of earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings (e.g., when hedged inventory is sold).
Fair Values of Financial Instruments Unless otherwise specified, the company believes the carrying value of financial instruments approximates their fair value.
Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Liabilities  The company records liabilities for the costs the company is legally obligated to incur in order to retire a long-lived asset at some point in the future. The fair values of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, and the cost associated with these liabilities is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related assets. Over time, the liability will increase, reflecting the accretion of the obligation from its present value to the amount the company will pay to extinguish the liability and the capitalized asset retirement costs will be depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets.
Environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change. The company does not discount its environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable. Managements estimate of its potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements. The company has not reduced its environmental liabilities for potential insurance recoveries.
Employment-Related Benefits  Employment-related benefits associated with pensions, postretirement health care benefits and workers compensation are expensed as such obligations are incurred by the company. The recognition of expense is impacted by estimates made by management, such as discount rates used to value certain liabilities, future health costs and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported. The company uses third-party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with employment-related benefits.
Revenue Recognition  Revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss are transferred to customers upon delivery based on terms of sale. Revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received after deducting estimated amounts for discounts, trade allowances and product returns. The company, principally in its Food Ingredients segment, receives cash advances on sales from customers in the ordinary course of business. These advances on sales are reflected in current liabilities until inventory is delivered to the customer based on terms of sale, at which time revenue is recognized.
Net Sales Gross profits earned from commodity trading activities, which are included in net sales, total $264.4 million, $166.6 million and $194.9 million for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Net sales and cost of goods sold, if reported on a gross basis for these activities, would be increased by $17.9 billion, $14.0 billion and $14.3 billion for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
46 Marketing Costs The company incurs various types of marketing costs in order to promote its products, including retailer incentives and consumer incentives. The company expenses each of these types of marketing costs as incurred. In addition, the company incurs advertising costs, which are expensed in the year incurred. Advertising and promotion expenses totaled $343.8 million, $406.2 million and $436.0 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation The company has stockholder approved stock option plans which provide for granting of options to employees for purchase of common stock at prices equal to the fair value at the time of grant. The company accounts for its employee stock option plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Accordingly, no stock-based compensation expense is reflected in net income for stock options granted, as options granted under these plans have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The company issues stock under various stock-based compensation arrangements approved by stockholders, including restricted stock, phantom stock and stock issued in lieu of cash bonuses. The value of restricted and phantom stock, equal to fair value at the time of grant, is amortized as compensation expense over the vesting period. Stock issued in lieu of cash bonuses is recognized as compensation expense as earned. In addition, the company grants restricted share equivalents. The restricted share equivalents are credited with appreciation or depreciation in the companys stock during the restriction period and will be settled in cash when the restriction period ends. The company amortizes the expense associated with the restricted share equivalents over the period of restriction.
The following table illustrates the required pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share assuming the company had followed the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation , for all outstanding and unvested stock options and other stock-based compensation for the years ended May 29, 2005, May 30, 2004 and May 25, 2003.
2005 2004 2003 Net income, as   reported $ 641.5 $ 811.3 $ 763.8 Add: Stock-based   employee compensation included in reported net income, net of related tax   effects 15.3 13.5 11.3 Deduct: Total   stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based   method, net of related tax effects (32.9 ) (31.8 ) (31.5 ) Pro forma net   income $ 623.9 $ 793.0 $ 743.6 Earnings per   share: Basic earnings   per share - as reported $ 1.24 $ 1.54 $ 1.44 Basic earnings   per share - pro forma $ 1.21 $ 1.50 $ 1.41 Diluted earnings   per share - as reported $ 1.23 $ 1.53 $ 1.44 Diluted earnings   per share - pro forma $ 1.20 $ 1.50 $ 1.41 The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used: 2005 2004 2003 Dividend yield 4.0 % 4.0 % 3.9 % Expected   volatility 21.4 % 27.9 % 30.0 % Risk-free   interest rate 3.48 % 3.08 % 4.30 % Expected life of   stock option 6 years 6 years 6 years The weighted average fair value per option was $4.14, $4.22 and $5.88 for options granted during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
47 Income Taxes The company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes . The company recognizes current tax liabilities and assets based on an estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current year for each of the jurisdictions in which the company transacts business. As part of the determination of its current tax liability, management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating positions taken by the company in its tax returns. The company has established reserves for probable tax exposures. These reserves, included in current liabilities, represent the companys estimate of amounts expected to be paid, which the company adjusts over time as more information regarding tax audits becomes available.
The company also recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences (e.g., book depreciation versus tax depreciation). If appropriate, the company recognizes valuation allowances to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be ultimately realized, based on the companys assessment of estimated future taxable income, including the consideration of available tax planning strategies.
Comprehensive Income  Comprehensive income includes net income, currency translation adjustments, certain derivative-related activity, changes in the value of the companys available-for-sale investments and changes in the minimum pension liability. When the company deems its foreign investments to be permanent in nature, it does not provide for taxes on currency translation adjustments arising from converting the investment in a foreign currency to U.S. dollars. The company reclassified $14.3 million of foreign currency translation gains, and $7.1 million and $7.2 million of foreign currency translation losses to net income due to the disposal of foreign subsidiaries in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The following is a rollforward of the balances in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax (except for currency translation adjustment): Currency Translation Adjustment Net Derivative Adjustment Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Securities, net Minimum Pension Liability Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) Balance at May   26, 2002 $ (117.7 ) $ (21.4 ) $  $ (13.4 ) $ (152.5 ) Current-period   change 60.1 (2.1 )  (64.9 ) (6.9 ) Balance at May   25, 2003 (57.6 ) (23.5 )  (78.3 ) (159.4 ) Current-period   change 44.6 31.5 90.5 12.7 179.3 Balance at May   30, 2004 (13.0 ) 8.0 90.5 (65.6 ) 19.9 Current-period   change 26.6 (0.8 ) (0.5 ) (1.2 ) 24.1 Balance at May   29, 2005 $ 13.6 $ 7.2 $ 90.0 $ (66.8 ) $ 44.0 The following details the income tax expense (benefit) on components of other comprehensive income (loss): 2005 2004 2003 Net derivative   adjustment $ (0.5 ) $ 19.3 $ (1.3 ) Unrealized gain   (loss) on available-for-sale securities (0.3 ) 55.4  Minimum pension   liability (0.8 ) 7.8 (39.8 ) Use of Estimates Preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as reflected in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Reclassifications  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the company completed the disposition of the remaining 48 businesses of its Agricultural Products segment (UAP International). The company had completed the sale of the U.S. and Canadian crop inputs business (UAP North America) in November 2003. Accordingly, the company reflects the results of the entire former Agricultural Products segment as discontinued operations.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the company implemented a plan to exit its specialty meats foodservice business. The company closed a manufacturing facility in Alabama, sold its operations in California and is negotiating a sale of its operations in Illinois. Upon the sale of the Illinois operations in July 2005, the company has no remaining specialty meats operations. Accordingly, the company removed the results of these businesses from the Foodservice Products reporting segment and now reflects the results of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
In May 2004, the company completed the sale of its animal feed business located in Spain and Portugal (Spanish feed business). The company completed the sale of a related poultry business in Portugal (Portuguese poultry business) in June 2004. Accordingly, the company removed the results of these businesses from the Food Ingredients reporting segment and reflects the results of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
In November2003, the company completed the sale of its chicken business. The company removed the chicken business results from the Meat Processing reporting segment and reflects the chicken business results as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
In September 2002, the company sold a controlling interest in its fresh beef and pork operations to a joint venture led by outside investors. In the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the company sold its remaining minority interest investment in the fresh meat processing component of this business. Also in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the company, through a series of transactions, disposed of its remaining interest in the cattle feeding component of this business. Certain cattle feeding related inventory balances were retained by the company and were sold in the ordinary course of business throughout the remainder of fiscal 2005. The company reports the results of the cattle feeding operations in discontinued operations from September 2004 through the end of fiscal 2005. The company reports its share of the results of the fresh meat processing and cattle feeding operations from September 2002 through September 2004 as equity method investment earnings. The results of the fresh meat processing and cattle feeding operations prior to September 2002 are reported in the Meat Processing reporting segment.
Accounting Changes Effective February22, 2004, the company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities , as revised December2003 (FIN 46R). As a result of adopting FIN 46R, the company has consolidated the assets and liabilities of several entities from which it leases property, plant and equipment, resulting in a cumulative effect of accounting change that reduced net income by $1.4 million (net of taxes of $0.9 million) in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. Certain of the entities from which the company leases various buildings are partnerships (the partnerships), the beneficial owners of which are Opus Corporation or its affiliates (Opus). A member of the companys board of directors is a beneficial owner, officer and director of Opus. Financing costs related to these leases were previously included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Effective with the adoption of FIN 46R, these financing costs are included in interest expense, net. The company also deconsolidated ConAgra Capital, L.C., an indirectly controlled subsidiary of the company. The company removed the preferred securities of a subsidiary company of $175.0 million upon the deconsolidation of ConAgra Capital, L.C., which securities are included in the long-term debt balance as of May 30, 2004. During the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the company redeemed these securities. The company has no other material obligations arising out of variable interests with unconsolidated entities.
Effective May 26, 2003, the company adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations , which requires the company to recognize the fair value of a liability associated with the cost the company is legally obligated to incur in order to retire an asset at some point in the future. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the associated long-lived asset. Over time, the liability increases, reflecting the accretion of the obligation from its present value to the amount the company estimates it will pay to extinguish the liability, and the capitalized asset retirement costs are depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Application of this accounting standard resulted in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting that decreased net income by $11.7 million (net of taxes of $7.2 million), or $0.02 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Asset retirement obligations of 49 $12.7 million and $18.5 million are reflected in the companys balance sheets at May 29, 2005 and May 30, 2004, respectively. The majority of the companys asset retirement obligations relate to various contractual obligations for restoration of leased assets at the end of lease terms.
The company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , at the beginning of fiscal 2003. The companys adoption of SFAS No. 142 resulted in a cumulative effect of an accounting change that increased net income by $3.9 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended May 25, 2003. Amortization of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives was discontinued as of the adoption date.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share-Based Payment . SFAS No. 123R will require the company to measure the cost of all employee stock-based compensation awards based on the grant date fair value of those awards and to record that cost as compensation expense over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award (generally over the vesting period of the award). Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have an impact on the companys results of operations, although it will have no impact on the companys overall financial position. SFAS No. 123R is effective beginning in the companys first quarter of fiscal 2007. Management is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this statement will have on the companys consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 . SFAS No. 151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Inventory Pricing , for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage), requiring that those items be recognized as current-period expenses. This statement also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The statement is effective for inventory costs incurred beginning in the companys fiscal 2007. Management is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this statement will have on the companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29 . APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions , is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. SFAS No. 153 amends APB Opinion No. 29, eliminating the exception to fair value accounting for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets, and replaces it with a general exception to fair value accounting for nonmonetary exchanges that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. The statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. Management does not expect this statement to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.
50 2.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND DIVESTITURES Chicken Business Divestiture On November 23, 2003, the company completed the sale of its chicken business to Pilgrims Pride Corporation (the chicken business divestiture). The company has reflected the results of operations, cash flows, assets and liabilities of the chicken business as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
As part of the divestiture, the company received $301.0 million of cash and 25.4 million shares of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock valued at $246.1 million. The fair value of the Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock was based on an independent valuation as of the date of the transaction and was reflective of the common stocks trading restrictions.
The final sales price of the chicken business was subject to a purchase price adjustment based on determination of the final net assets sold, which occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. As part of the final purchase price adjustment, the company paid $34 million to Pilgrims Pride. The company recognized a pre-tax loss of $11.7 million ($7.1 million after tax) for this final settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the company recognized an impairment charge of $69.4 million (net of an income tax benefit of $42.6 million) to reduce the carrying amount of the chicken business goodwill to zero and to reflect a reduction in the carrying values of long-lived assets of the chicken business to their fair value, less cost to sell.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the company sold ten million shares of the Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock for $282.5 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $185.7 million and a net-of-tax reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income of $115.2 million.
Subsequent Event In August 2005, the company sold the remaining 15.4 million shares of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock to that company for $482 million. The company will recognize a pre-tax gain of approximately $333 million, which will be subject to federal and state income tax, in its first quarter of fiscal 2006. This gain included the following: Amounts included   in accumulated other comprehensive income at May 29, 2005 for 6.96 million   shares classified as available-for-sale $ 181 Reduction in   value (including sales commission) associated with shares classified as   available-for-sale from May29, 2005 to August 3, 2005 (30 ) Gain realized on   the additional 8.48 million shares not classified as available-for-sale 182 Total pre-tax   gain $ 333 UAP North America and UAP International Divestitures On November23, 2003, the company completed the sale of UAP North America to Apollo Management, L.P. (Apollo). In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the company completed the disposition of the remaining businesses of its Agricultural Products segment (UAP International). Accordingly, the company reflects the results of the entire Agricultural Products segment as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
As part of its disposition of UAP North America, the company initially received $503 million of cash, $60 million of SeriesA redeemable preferred stock of UAP Holdings (the UAP Preferred Securities) and $61 million in the form of a receivable from Apollo. The company collected the receivable balance in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. As of May29, 2005, UAP Holdings had repurchased all of the preferred securities for cash.
As a result of the UAP North America divestiture, the company recognized during fiscal 2004 a loss on disposition of businesses of $14.6 million and $43.8 million of income resulting from rebates UAP North America received from its suppliers subsequent to the divestiture date that relate to pre-divestiture operations. These amounts are included in the companys results from discontinued operations.
The company sold substantially all of the remaining assets of UAP International during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2005 for total proceeds of $43.3 million, resulting in a loss of $2.4 million. The company had previously recognized impairment charges of $9.7 million and $28.6 million in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005, respectively, in order to reflect the assets of UAP International at their estimated fair value, less cost to sell, in accordance with SFAS No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets . Through the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the company had not recognized any tax benefit in relation to these impairment charges, as management believed that the ultimate realization of these losses would not be tax deductible. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the company implemented a tax planning strategy, concurrent with the disposition of the assets of UAP International, which effectively allowed the company to reduce its taxable income in the United States by the amount of losses realized on the sale of a portion of UAP International. As such, the company recognized a tax benefit of $20.8 million within results of discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.
51 The companys UAP North America and UAP International operations had a fiscal year-end of February, while the companys consolidated year-end is May. Historically, the results of UAP North America and UAP International have been reflected in the companys consolidated results on a three-month lag (e.g., UAPs results for Decemberthrough Februaryare included in the companys consolidated results for the period Marchthrough May). Due to the disposition of UAP North America in November2003, a $23.8 million net-of-tax loss, representing the results for the three months ending November2003, was recorded directly to retained earnings. If this business had not been divested, this net-of-tax loss would have been recognized in the companys fiscal 2004 consolidated statement of earnings. Due to the disposition of UAP International in April2005, $2.2 million net-of-tax income, representing the results for the three months ending April2005, was recorded directly to retained earnings. If this business had not been divested, this net-of-tax income would have been recognized in the companys fiscal 2005 and 2006 consolidated statements of earnings.
Spanish Feed and Portuguese Poultry Divestitures On May 26, 2004, the company completed the sale of its Spanish feed business to the Carlyle Group for cash proceeds of $82.6 million, resulting in a gain from disposal of businesses of $33.6 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the company wrote-down certain assets of the Portuguese poultry business by $17.2 million in order to reflect these assets at their fair value. The company completed the sale of the Portuguese poultry business for cash proceeds of $3.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The company removed the results of these businesses from the Food Ingredients reporting segment and reflects the results of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Specialty Meats Divestiture In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the company implemented a plan to exit the specialty meats foodservice business. The company closed a manufacturing facility in Alabama, sold its operations in California and, in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, completed the sale of its operations in Illinois. Upon the sale of the Illinois operations, the company has no remaining specialty meats operations. Accordingly, the company removed the results of these businesses from the Foodservice Products reporting segment and now reflects the results of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
The company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $22.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 upon the decision to close the manufacturing facility in Alabama, thereby reducing the carrying value of the assets to their expected salvage value, and recognized an additional $4.4 million charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 for shut down-related costs. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Board of Directors approved a plan to dispose of the manufacturing facilities in California and Illinois. The sale of the facility in California resulted in a pre-tax loss of $2.9 million. The company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $8.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 to reduce the carrying value of the Illinois facility to its estimated fair value.
Fresh Beef & Pork Divestiture In September 2002, the company sold a controlling interest in its fresh beef and pork operations to a joint venture led by Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst Incorporated (Hicks Muse). Outside investors purchased 55% of the joint venture and the company continued to own the remaining 45%. The fresh beef operations sold to the joint venture included a beef processing business as well as a cattle feeding business.
The purchase price associated with the cattle feeding business was financed entirely by the company with cattle feeding-related notes receivable maturing in September 2004. These notes were collateralized by the cattle, feedlots and other assets of the cattle feeding business. Due to the purchase price of the cattle feeding business being entirely financed by the company, the legal divestiture of the cattle feeding operation was not recognized as a divestiture for accounting purposes, and the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the cattle feeding business were reflected in the companys financial statements prior to October 15, 2004.
52 In August 2004, Hicks Muse exercised its option to acquire the companys minority interest investment in the fresh beef and pork business (Swift Foods), and as a consequence, on September 24, 2004, the company sold its minority interest investment in Swift Foods to Hicks Muse for $194.1 million, resulting in no significant gain or loss to the company. The company continues to hold subordinated notes in the original principal amount of $150 million plus accrued interest of $35.2 million from Swift Foods. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, Swift Foods effected changes in its capital structure. As a result of those changes, the company determined that the fair value of the subordinated notes was impaired. The company believes this impairment of an available-for-sale security is temporary. As such, the company has reduced the carrying value of the note by $38.6 million and recorded an after-tax charge of $24.0 million in accumulated other comprehensive income.
On September 24, 2004, the company reached an agreement with affiliates of Swift Foods by which the company took control and ownership of approximately $300 million of the net assets of the cattle feeding business, including feedlots and live cattle. On October 15, 2004, the company sold the feedlots to Smithfield Foods for approximately $70 million. These transactions resulted in a gain of approximately $19.0 million (net of taxes of $11.6 million). The company retained live cattle inventory and related derivative instruments and liquidated those assets in an orderly manner over the succeeding several months. The company completed the sale of the live cattle inventory by the end of fiscal 2005. Beginning September 24, 2004, the assets, liabilities and results of operations, including the gain on sale, of the cattle feeding business are classified as discontinued operations.
Summary results of operations of the former Agricultural Products segment, the chicken business, the Spanish feed and Portuguese poultry businesses, the cattle feeding business and the specialty meats foodservice business included within discontinued operations are as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Net sales $ 948.8 $ 4,096.9 $ 5,666.1 Long-lived asset   impairment charge (59.4 ) (26.9 ) (112.0 ) Income (loss)   from operations of discontinued operations before income taxes (12.9 ) 137.5 27.8 Net gain from   disposal of businesses 26.3 51.1 - Income (loss)   before income taxes (46.0 ) 161.7 (84.2 ) Income tax   (expense) benefit 24.4 (64.4 ) 32.0 Income (loss)   from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (21.6 ) $ 97.3 $ (52.2 ) The assets and liabilities of the former Agricultural Products segment, the Spanish feed and Portuguese poultry businesses and the specialty meats foodservice business as of May 29, 2005 and May 30, 2004 are as follows: 2005 2004 Receivables,   less allowances for doubtful accounts $ 0.9 $ 102.6 Inventories 28.5 112.8 Prepaid expenses   and other current assets  5.7 Current assets of discontinued operations $ 29.4 $ 221.1 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 3.9 $ 51.3 Goodwill and other intangibles  8.0 Other assets  1.3 Noncurrent assets of discontinued operations $ 3.9 $ 60.6 Notes payable $  $ 23.2 Accounts payable 6.1 97.6 Other accrued liabilities and advances on sales 4.1 22.0 Current liabilities of discontinued operations $ 10.2 $ 142.8 53 3.
GOODWILL AND OTHER IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill by reporting segment is as follows: 2005 2004 Retail Products $ 3,477.7 $ 3,476.9 Foodservice Products 283.2 277.1 Food Ingredients 36.8 34.6 Total $ 3,797.7 $ 3,788.6 Other identifiable intangible assets are as follows: 2005 2004 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Non-amortizing   intangible assets $ 790.5 $  $ 798.1 $  Amortizing   intangible assets 42.1 12.9 38.7 9.9 Total $ 832.6 $ 12.9 $ 836.8 $ 9.9 Non-amortizing intangible assets are comprised of the following balances: 2005 2004 Brands/Trademarks $ 769.6 $ 776.4 Pension Intangible Asset 19.5 20.3 Miscellaneous 1.4 1.4 Total non-amortizing intangible assets $ 790.5 $ 798.1 Amortizing intangible assets, carrying a weighted average life of approximately 16 years, are principally composed of licensing arrangements and customer lists. For fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, the company recognized $2.1 million, $2.8 million and $3.8 million, respectively, of amortization expense. Based on amortizing assets recognized in the companys balance sheet as of May 29, 2005, amortization expense is estimated to be approximately $3 million for each of the next five years.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of approximately $9 million to reflect a reduction in value of one of its brands, due to changes in the companys strategy for the future use of the brand.
54 4. EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated on the basis of weighted average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of basic weighted average outstanding common shares adjusted for the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock awards and other dilutive securities.
The following table reconciles the income and average share amounts used to compute both basic and diluted earnings per share: 2005 2004 2003 Net   Income: Income from   continuing operations before cumulative effect of changes in accounting $ 663.1 $ 727.1 $ 812.1 Income (loss) from discontinued operations (21.6 ) 97.3 (52.2 ) Cumulative   effect of changes in accounting  (13.1 ) 3.9 Net income $ 641.5 $ 811.3 $ 763.8 Weighted Average Shares   Outstanding: Basic weighted average shares outstanding 516.2 527.2 528.6 Add: Dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock   awards and other dilutive securities 4.0 3.5 2.1 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 520.2 530.7 530.7 At the end of fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, there were 6.9 million, 12.2 million and 15.4 million stock options outstanding, respectively, that were excluded from the computation of shares contingently issuable upon exercise of the stock options because exercise prices exceeded the annual average market value of common stock.
5. RECEIVABLES SECURITIZATION The company had previously entered into agreements to sell interests in pools of receivables, in an amount not to exceed $400 million at any one time. During fiscal 2005, the company effectively terminated these agreements. There were no interests in pools of receivables sold at fiscal year-end 2005 and 2004.
6. COST REDUCTION EFFORTS In fiscal 2004, the company identified specific operating efficiency initiatives as part of an effort to improve the companys cost structure, margins and competitive position. As a result of these specific initiatives, the company recognized certain expenses during fiscal 2004 and 2005, including employee termination costs, accelerated depreciation on fixed assets, equipment/employee relocation costs, asset impairments and other related costs. The company recognized $21.1 million and $61.8 million of expenses in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively, for these initiatives. These costs were incurred primarily in the Retail Products segment in fiscal 2005 and in the Retail Products and Foodservice Products segments in fiscal 2004. The company does not anticipate additional costs associated with these initiatives.
In addition to the above, as part of the companys ongoing efforts to reduce general and administrative expenses, including salaried headcount, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the company announced it was in the process of eliminating several hundred salaried jobs across the organization. The headcount reductions will be largely complete by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The company recognized $42.7 million of severance expense during fiscal 2005 primarily within its Retail Products segment and Corporate. As of the end of fiscal 2005, $42.4 million was reflected in other accrued liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet.
55 7.
ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND CASUALTY LOSS During fiscal 2005, the company determined that it would close a manufacturing facility within its Food Ingredients segment and recognized a charge of $15.0 million to reduce the carrying amounts of the related long-lived assets to their fair values.
As a result of a fire at a manufacturing facility in fiscal 2005, the company recognized a charge, net of insurance recoveries, of $10.0 million in the Foodservice Products segment for the loss of inventory and property, plant and equipment.
In fiscal 2005, the company determined the carrying values of its investments in two unrelated joint ventures were other than temporarily impaired and therefore recognized pre-tax impairment charges totaling $71.0 million ($65.6 million after tax). The pre-tax charges are reflected in equity method investment earnings (loss) in the statement of earnings. The extent of the impairments was determined based upon the companys assessment of the recoverability of its investments, including an assessment of the investees ability to sustain earnings which would justify the carrying amount of the investments.
During fiscal 2005, the company recorded a pre-tax charge of $10.0 million for an impairment of a brand and related assets in the Retail Products segment.
8. INVENTORIES The major classes of inventories are as follows: 2005 2004 Raw materials   and packaging $ 1,013.0 $ 1,104.0 Work in progress 79.7 70.6 Finished goods 1,382.4 1,170.6 Supplies and other 139.4 171.3 $ 2,614.5 $ 2,516.5 9. CREDIT FACILITIES AND BORROWINGS At May 29, 2005, the company had credit lines from banks that totaled approximately $1.4 billion, including $1.05 billion of long-term revolving credit facilities maturing in May 2007 and short-term loan facilities approximating $345 million. The company has not drawn upon the long-term revolving credit facilities. Borrowings under the long-term revolver agreements bear interest at or below prime rate and may be prepaid without penalty. As of May 29, 2005, the company had $8.5 million drawn under the short-term loan facilities.
The company finances its short-term liquidity needs with bank borrowings, commercial paper borrowings and bankers acceptances. The average consolidated short-term borrowings outstanding under these facilities were $118.6 million and $121.1 million for fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. The highest period-end, short-term indebtedness during fiscal 2005 and 2004 was $270.5 million and $295.0 million, respectively. The weighted average interest rate was 1.15% and 2.33% for fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively.

As of the end of fiscal 2005, the companys consolidated funded debt was approximately 45% of its consolidated capital base and the fixed charges ratio was approximately 3.9 to 1.0.
Net interest expense consists of: 2005 2004 2003 Long-term debt $ 349.1 $ 335.1 $ 328.4 Short-term debt 0.8 7.2 19.2 Interest income (27.0 ) (49.6 ) (53.7 ) Interest   included in cost of goods sold (19.3 ) (13.4 ) (15.3 ) Interest   capitalized (8.6 ) (4.4 ) (3.9 ) $ 295.0 $ 274.9 $ 274.7 As noted in the above table, interest expense incurred to finance hedged inventories has been reflected in cost of goods sold.
Net interest paid was $360.3 million, $334.2 million and $293.5 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
In fiscal 2004, the company received approximately $134 million from the termination of all of its interest rate swaps (see Note 18). The proceeds are not included in the net interest paid amount for fiscal 2004. The companys net interest expense was reduced by $27.5 million in fiscal 2005 due to the net impact of previously closed interest rate swap agreements, as compared to $76.1 million in fiscal 2004.
The carrying amount of long-term debt (including current installments) was $4.5 billion and $5.7 billion as of May 29, 2005 and May 30, 2004, respectively. Based on current market rates provided primarily by outside investment bankers, the fair value of this debt at May 29, 2005, and May30, 2004 was estimated at $5.2 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the company retired $600 million of 7.5% senior debt that was due September 2005. This early retirement of debt resulted in a pre-tax loss of $22 million, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Also in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the company redeemed the preferred securities of ConAgra Capital, L.C., an indirectly controlled subsidiary of the company, held by third parties in the amount of $175 million. Due to the adoption of FIN 46R, ConAgra Capital, L.C. was deconsolidated, and therefore the loan between the company and ConAgra Capital, L.C. was reflected in the companys consolidated balance sheet as $221 million of long-term debt and the amount of the companys investment in ConAgra Capital, L.C. of $46 million was reflected as other assets as of May 30, 2004.
In addition to these early retirements of debt, the company made scheduled principal payments during fiscal 2005, reducing long-term debt by $385 million.
58 11. OTHER NONCURRENT LIABILITIES Other noncurrent liabilities consist of: 2005 2004 Legal and   environmental liabilities primarily associated with the companys acquisition   of Beatrice Company (see Note 17) $ 111.3 $ 132.2 Postretirement   health care and pensions 615.8 578.9 Deferred taxes 477.8 377.5 Liabilities of   divested cattle feeding operations (see Note 2)  34.8 Other 77.2 97.1 1,282.1 1,220.5 Less current   portion (87.5 ) (77.4 ) $ 1,194.6 $ 1,143.1 12.

On December 4, 2003, the company announced a share repurchase program of up to $1 billion. During fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, the company repurchased approximately 6.8 million shares at a total cost of $181.4 million and 15.3 million shares at a total cost of $418.6 million, respectively.
13. EMPLOYEE EQUITY FUND In fiscal 1993, the company established a $700 million Employee Equity Fund (EEF), a grantor trust, to pre-fund future stock-related obligations of the companys compensation and benefit plans. The EEF supported employee plans that used ConAgra Foods common stock.
For financial reporting purposes, the EEF was consolidated with ConAgra Foods. The fair value of the shares held by the EEF was shown as a reduction to common stockholders equity in the companys consolidated balance sheets. All dividends and interest transactions between the EEF and ConAgra Foods were eliminated. Differences between cost and fair value of shares held and/or released were included in consolidated additional paid-in capital.
During fiscal 2005, all remaining shares held by the EEF were issued, and the EEF was terminated. At May 30, 2004, the EEF held 1.1 million shares at a cost per share of $14.55 and a fair value per share of $28.12.
59 14. STOCK PLANS Stock option plans approved by the stockholders provide for granting of options to employees for purchase of common stock at prices equal to fair value at the time of grant. Options become exercisable under various vesting schedules (typically three to five years) and generally expire 10 years after the date of grant.
A summary of the outstanding and exercisable stock options during the three years ended May 29, 2005 is presented below: 2005 2004 2003 (Shares in millions) Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding at   beginning of year 28.8 $ 23.98 35.2 $ 23.76 31.9 $ 22.97 Granted 3.8 $ 27.43 3.7 $ 21.90 7.5 $ 25.58 Exercised (5.2 ) $ 21.94 (5.8 ) $ 20.47 (2.3 ) $ 17.71 Forfeited/Expired (3.2 ) $ 26.10 (4.3 ) $ 25.19 (1.9 ) $ 24.82 Outstanding at   end of year 24.2 $ 24.71 28.8 $ 23.98 35.2 $ 23.76 Options   exercisable at end of year 18.1 $ 24.73 18.9 $ 24.46 21.1 $ 23.83 The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding as of May 29, 2005: Options Outstanding Options Exercisable (Shares in millions) Range of Exercise Prices Number Outstanding Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life Weighted Average Exercise Price Number Exercisable Weighted Average Exercise Price $ 4.87 - $ 20.75 1.9 4.2 $ 19.63 1.9 $ 19.63 $ 20.76 - $ 22.00 7.6 6.6 $ 21.60 5.2 $ 21.64 $ 22.01 - $ 25.36 4.7 5.0 $ 24.40 4.0 $ 24.27 $ 25.37 - $ 28.31 8.1 7.2 $ 26.98 5.1 $ 26.95 $ 28.32 - $ 36.81 1.9 2.8 $ 33.28 1.9 $ 33.37 $ 4.87 - $ 36.81 24.2 6.0 $ 24.71 18.1 $ 24.73 In accordance with stockholder-approved plans, the company grants stock under various stock-based compensation arrangements including restricted stock, phantom stock and stock issued in lieu of cash bonuses. Under each arrangement, stock is issued without direct cost to the employee. In addition, the company grants restricted share equivalents. The restricted share equivalents are credited with appreciation or depreciation in the companys stock during the restriction period and will be settled in cash when the restriction period ends. During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, the company granted shares and share equivalents totaling 1.9 million, 2.1 million and 1.1 million, respectively, with a weighted average grant date value of $27.50, $23.95 and $25.15, respectively, under these arrangements. The compensation expense for the companys stock-based awards totaled $25.1 million, $21.8 million and $18.2 million for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. At May 29, 2005, the amount of deferred stock-based compensation granted, but to be recognized over future periods, was estimated to be $69.9 million.
60 At May 29, 2005, approximately 13.9 million shares were reserved for granting additional options and restricted, phantom or bonus stock awards.

At May 29, 2005 and May 30, 2004, net deferred tax liabilities of $477.8 million and $377.5 million, respectively, are included in other noncurrent liabilities.
The reserve for tax contingencies related to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) exams, state and local exams and international tax matte rs was $41.4 million at May 29, 2005 and $43.1 million at May 30, 2004. The company reached an agreement with the IRS with respect to the IRSs examination of the companys tax returns for fiscal years 2000 through 2002. As a result of the resolution of these matters, the company reduced income tax expense and income taxes payable by $4.6 million during fiscal 2005.
Certain tax authorities have proposed adjustments for later years, some of which are being contested by the company. The company believes that it has made adequate provisions for income taxes payable.
The company has approximately $37 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards ($25 million expire between 2006 and 2014 and $12 million have no expiration dates). The company also has $40 million of foreign tax credits which will expire in 2013.
The company has recorded a valuation allowance for the portion of the net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and other deferred tax assets it believes will not be realized. The net impact on income tax expense related to changes in the valuation allowance for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $9.1 million, $0 and $19.2 million, respectively.
The company has not provided U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative earnings of non-U.S. affiliates and associated companies that have been reinvested indefinitely. Deferred taxes are provided for earnings of non-U.S. federal affiliates and associated companies when the company plans to remit those earnings.
62 16. COMMITMENTS The company leases certain facilities and transportation equipment under agreements that expire at various dates. Rent expense under all operating leases for continuing operations was $188.8 million, $183.4 million and $207.0 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Rent expense under operating leases for discontinued operations was $5.0 million, $36.9 million and $73.3 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
A summary of noncancelable operating lease commitments for fiscal years following May 29, 2005, is as follows: 2006 $ 103.4 2007 122.1 2008 78.4 2009 66.7 2010 59.1 Later years 310.9 $ 740.6 The company had performance bonds and other commitments and guarantees outstanding at May 29, 2005, aggregating to $63.4 million. This amount includes approximately $38 million in guarantees and other commitments the company has made on behalf of the divested fresh beef and pork business.
ConAgra Foods enters into many lease agreements for land, buildings and equipment at competitive market rates, and some of the lease arrangements are with Opus Corporation or its affiliates. A director of ConAgra Foods is a beneficial owner, officer and director of Opus Corporation. The agreements relate to the leasing of land and buildings for ConAgra Foods. ConAgra Foods occupies the buildings pursuant to long-term leases with Opus Corporation and its affiliates, some of which contain various termination rights and purchase options. Leases effective in fiscal 2005 required annual lease payments by ConAgra Foods of $19.8 million. As a result of adopting FIN 46R, the company has consolidated certain of the Opus affiliates from which it leases property, plant and equipment.These leases were previously accounted for as operating leases. Opus Corporation or its affiliates were paid $52.9 million for construction work during fiscal 2005 on properties leased by ConAgra Foods from third parties. Opus Corporation had revenues in excess of $1.25 billion in 2004.
17. CONTINGENCIES In fiscal 1991, the company acquired Beatrice Company (Beatrice). As a result of the acquisition and the significant pre-acquisition contingencies of the Beatrice businesses and its former subsidiaries, the consolidated post-acquisition financial statements of the company reflect significant liabilities associated with the estimated resolution of these contingencies. These include various litigation and environmental proceedings related to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to its acquisition by the company. The environmental proceedings include litigation and administrative proceedings involving Beatrices status as a potentially responsible party at 31 Superfund, proposed Superfund or state-equivalent sites; these sites involve locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of Beatrice that used or produced petroleum, pesticides, fertilizers, dyes, inks, solvents, PCBs, acids, lead, sulfur, tannery wastes and/or other contaminants. Beatrice has paid or is in the process of paying its liability share at 30 of these sites. Reserves for these matters have been established based on the companys best estimate of its undiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required cleanup, the known volumetric contribution of Beatrice and other potentially responsible parties and its experience in remediating sites. The reserves for Beatrice environmental matters totaled $109.5 million as of May 29, 2005 and $115.2 million as of May 30, 2004, a majority of which relates to the Superfund and state equivalent sites referenced above. Expenditures for these matters are expected to occur over a period of 5 to 20 years.
In certain limited situations, the company will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity. Currently, the company guarantees certain obligations primarily associated with leases entered into by several of its equity method 63 investees. Under these arrangements, the company is obligated to perform under these leases (i.e., make the lease payments) should the equity method investees be unable to perform. Most of these guarantees resulted from the companys fresh beef and pork divestiture. The leases have terms not exceeding 10 years and the maximum amount of future payments the company has guaranteed is approximately $45.7 million. The company has also assigned a hog purchase contract to the beef and pork business, and the fresh beef and pork business has indemnified the company for all liabilities under the contract. The company has guaranteed the performance of the fresh beef and pork business with respect to the hog purchase contract. The hog purchase contract requires the fresh beef and pork business to purchase a minimum of approximately 1.2 million hogs annually through 2014. The contract stipulates minimum price commitments, based in part on market prices and, in certain circumstances, also includes price adjustments based on certain inputs. The company does not have a liability established in its balance sheet for these arrangements as the company has determined that performance under the guarantees is not probable.
The results for fiscal 2004 include litigation expense related to a choline chloride joint venture with E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. (DuPont) that was sold in 1997. Subsequent to the sale, civil antitrust lawsuits against DuPont, the company and the venture were filed in various federal and state courts. In connection with the settlement of certain of these cases and the remaining civil actions, the company recorded a $25 million pre-tax charge against earnings in fiscal 2004 as an additional reserve for these matters. The litigation expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.
On June 22, 2001, the company filed an amended annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 28, 2000. The filing included restated financial information for fiscal years 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000. The restatement, due to accounting and conduct matters at United Agri Products, Inc. (UAP), a former subsidiary, was based upon an investigation undertaken by the company and the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors. The restatement was principally related to revenue recognition for deferred delivery sales and vendor rebates, advance vendor rebates and bad debt reserves. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a formal order of nonpublic investigation dated September 28, 2001. The company is cooperating with the SEC investigation, which relates to the UAP matters described above, as well as other aspects of the companys financial statements, including the level and application of certain of the companys reserves.
The company is currently conducting discussions with the SEC Staff regarding a possible settlement of these matters. Based on discussions to date, the company estimates the amount of such settlement and related payments to be approximately $46.5 million. The company recorded charges of $25 million and $21.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and the third quarter of fiscal 2005, respectively, in connection with the expected settlement of these matters. There can be no assurance that the negotiations with the SEC Staff will ultimately be successful or that the SEC will accept the terms of any settlement that is negotiated with the SEC Staff. Accordingly, the terms of any settlement, if reached, could result in charges greater than the amount currently estimated and recognized in the companys financial statements.
The company is a party to a number of lawsuits and claims arising out of the operation of its businesses. After taking into account liabilities recorded for all of the foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
18. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The company is exposed to market risks, such as changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. To manage volatility associated with these exposures, the company may enter into various derivative transactions (e.g., futures and options) pursuant to established company policies.
Commodity Price Management - The company is subject to raw material price fluctuations caused by supply conditions, weather, economic conditions and other factors. Generally, the company utilizes commodity futures and options contracts to reduce the volatility of commodity input prices on items such as vegetable oils, proteins, dairy, grains and energy.
64 Foreign Currency Management - In order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the company may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the applicable functional currency. This includes, but is not limited to, hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment, sales of finished goods and future settlement of foreign-denominated assets and liabilities.
Hedges of anticipated foreign currency-denominated transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The gains and losses associated with these hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction impacts earnings. Forward exchange and option contracts are also used to hedge firm commitment transactions denominated in a currency other than the applicable functional currency. The firm commitments and foreign currency hedges are both recognized at fair value within prepaid expenses and other current assets or other accrued liabilities. Gains and losses associated with firm commitment and foreign currency hedges are recognized within net sales, cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the nature of the transaction. Foreign currency derivatives that the company has elected not to account for under hedge accounting are recorded immediately in earnings within sales, cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the nature of the transaction.
Interest Rate Management - In order to reduce exposures related to changes in interest rates, the company may use derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps. During fiscal 2004, the company closed out all $2.5 billion of its interest rate swap agreements in order to lock-in existing favorable interest rates. These interest rate swap agreements were previously put in place as a strategy to hedge interest costs associated with long-term debt. For financial statement and tax purposes, the proceeds received upon termination of the interest rate swap agreements will be recognized over the term of the debt instruments originally hedged.
Of the $2.5 billion interest rate swaps closed out in fiscal 2004, $2 billion of the interest rate swaps had been used to effectively convert certain of the companys fixed rate debt into floating rate debt. These interest rate swaps were accounted for as fair value hedges and resulted in no recognition of ineffectiveness in the statement of earnings as the interest rate swaps provisions matched the applicable provisions of the hedged debt. The remaining $500 million portion of the companys interest rate swaps was used to hedge certain of the companys forecasted interest payments on floating rate debt for the period from 2005 through 2011. These interest rate swaps were accounted for as cash flow hedges with gains and losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income, to the extent the hedge was effective. During fiscal 2005, the company determined it was no longer probable that the related floating rate debt would be issued and therefore the company recognized approximately $13.6 million of additional interest expense associated with this interest rate swap. Overall, the companys net interest expense was reduced by $27.5 million in fiscal 2005 due to the net impact of previously closed interest rate swap agreements, as compared to $76.1 million in fiscal 2004.
The fair value of derivative assets is recognized within prepaid expenses and other current assets, while the fair value of derivative liabilities is recognized within other accrued liabilities. As of May 29, 2005 and May 30, 2004, the fair value of derivatives recognized within prepaid expenses and other current assets was $49.1 million and $128.1 million, respectively, while the amount recognized within other accrued liabilities was $15.8 million and $10.3 million, respectively. As of May 29, 2005 and May 30, 2004, there were no significant derivative-related amounts recognized in discontinued operations.
For fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, the ineffectiveness associated with derivatives designated as cash flow and fair value hedges from continuing operations was a loss of $0.1 million, gain of $4.1 million, and a loss of $1.6 million, respectively. Hedge ineffectiveness is recognized within net sales, cost of goods sold or interest expense, depending on the nature of the hedge. The company does not exclude any component of the hedging instruments gain or loss when assessing effectiveness.
65 Generally, the company hedges a portion of its anticipated consumption of commodity inputs for periods ranging from 12 to 36 months. The company may enter into longer-term hedges on particular commodities if deemed appropriate. As of May 29, 2005, the company had hedged certain portions of its anticipated consumption of commodity inputs through March 2008.
As of May 29, 2005 and May 30, 2004, the net deferred gain or loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income was a $5.4 million gain and an $8.0 million gain, net of tax, respectively. The company anticipates a gain of $4.4 million, net of tax, will be transferred out of accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized within earnings over the next 12 months. The company anticipates a gain of $1.0 million, net of tax, will be transferred out of accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized within earnings subsequent to the next 12 months.
A $1.8 million gain and a $9.6 million gain, net of tax, were transferred from accumulated other comprehensive income into income from continuing operations in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. For fiscal 2005 and 2004, no significant gains/losses were transferred from accumulated other comprehensive income into income (loss) from discontinued operations. Other than the discontinued interest rate cash flow hedge cited above, the company did not discontinue any cash flow or fair value hedges in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2004, the company recognized a $4.2 million net-of-tax gain within discontinued operations related to discontinued cash flow hedges that were no longer probable of occurring as a result of the chicken business divestiture.
19. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS The company and its subsidiaries have defined benefit retirement plans (plans) for eligible salaried and hourly employees. Benefits are based on years of credited service and average compensation or stated amounts for each year of service. The company uses February 28 as its measurement date for its plans. The company also sponsors postretirement plans which provide certain medical and dental benefits (other benefits) to qualifying U.S. employees.
The changes in benefit obligations and plan assets at February 28, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2005 2004 2005 2004 Change   in Benefit Obligation Benefit   obligation at beginning of year $ 2,111.2 $ 1,900.0 $ 527.7 $ 514.3 Service cost 58.7 61.7 2.8 3.8 Interest cost 123.2 119.7 26.1 31.9 Plan   participants contributions   6.3 4.6 Amendments 4.0 10.0 (87.0 ) 0.4 Actuarial (gain)   loss 52.0 134.4 (10.6 ) 26.1 Dispositions  (12.8 )  (2.0 ) Other 0.3 0.6 0.2 (2.6 ) Benefits paid (111.9 ) (102.4 ) (53.8 ) (48.8 ) Benefit   obligation at end of year $ 2,237.5 $ 2,111.2 $ 411.7 $ 527.7 Change   in Plan Assets Fair value of   plan assets at beginning of year $ 1,875.0 $ 1,540.9 $ 6.6 $ 4.4 Actual return on   plan assets 139.7 396.5 0.1 3.0 Dispositions  (7.8 )   Employer   contributions 9.2 65.8 46.7 43.4 Plan   participants contributions   6.3 4.6 Investment and   administrative expenses (19.6 ) (18.4 )   Other 0.1 0.4   Benefits paid (111.9 ) (102.4 ) (53.8 ) (48.8 ) Fair value of   plan assets at end of year $ 1,892.5 $ 1,875.0 $ 5.9 $ 6.6 66 The funded status and amounts recognized in the companys consolidated balance sheets at May 29, 2005 and May 30, 2004 were: Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2005 2004 2005 2004 Funded   status $ (345.0 ) $ (236.2 ) $ (405.9 ) $ (521.1 ) Unrecognized   actuarial loss 213.1 160.0 108.2 136.1 Unrecognized   prior service cost 17.2 15.7 (81.3 ) (3.9 ) Unrecognized   transition amount (0.3 ) (0.4 )   Fourth quarter   employer contribution 1.5 1.4 10.3  Accrued   benefit cost $ (113.5 ) $ (59.5 ) $ (368.7 ) $ (388.9 ) Amounts   Recognized in Consolidated Balance Sheets Accrued benefit   cost $ (248.1 ) $ (190.0 ) $ (368.7 ) $ (388.9 ) Intangible asset 19.5 20.2   Accumulated   other comprehensive loss 115.1 110.3   Net   amount recognized $ (113.5 ) $ (59.5 ) $ (368.7 ) $ (388.9 ) Weighted-Average   Actuarial Assumptions Used to Determine Benefit Obligations At February 28 Discount rate 5.75 % 6.00 % 5.50 % 6.00 % Long-term rate   of compensation increase 4.25 % 4.50 % N/A N/A The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion at February 28, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at February 28, 2005 and 2004 were: 2005 2004 Projected   benefit obligation $ 2,237.5 $ 610.7 Accumulated   benefit obligation 2,132.2 601.9 Fair value of   plan assets 1,892.5 440.6 67 Components of pension benefit and other postretirement benefit costs are: Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Service cost $ 58.7 $ 61.7 $ 62.1 $ 2.8 $ 3.8 $ 3.1 Interest cost 123.2 119.7 120.6 26.1 31.9 26.5 Expected return   on plan assets (131.1 ) (127.1 ) (113.1 ) (0.3 ) (0.6 ) (0.6 ) Amortization of   prior service costs 2.5 2.3 3.6 (9.6 ) (0.8 ) (0.7 ) Amortization of   transition asset (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.4 )    Recognized net   actuarial (gain) loss 10.1 5.3 2.5 8.1 2.4 (0.1 ) Curtailment   (gain) loss  5.0 1.2  (2.8 ) (1.1 ) Benefit cost    company plans 63.2 66.7 76.5 27.1 33.9 27.1 Pension benefit   cost  multi-employer plans 8.0 9.0 7.9    Total benefit   cost $ 71.2 $ 75.7 $ 84.4 $ 27.1 $ 33.9 $ 27.1 Weighted-Average   Actuarial Assumptions Used to Determine Net Expense Discount rate 6.00 % 6.50 % 7.25 % 6.00 % 6.50 % 7.25 % Long-term rate   of return on plan assets 7.75 % 7.75 % 7.75 % 4.50 % 13.7 % 13.7 % Long-term rate   of compensation increase 4.50 % 4.50 % 5.50 % N/A N/A N/A The company amortizes prior service costs and amortizable gains and losses in equal annual amounts over the average expected future period of vested service. For plans with no active participants, average life expectancy is used instead of average expected useful service.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for the pension plan, the company considers the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class is then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
Included in the companys postretirement plan assets are guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) entered into in 1981. In fiscal 2004, the company changed its estimate of fair value of the GICs and modified the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets from 13.7% (the stated yield of the contracts) to 4.5% (the effective yield on the contracts when stated at fair value). These changes did not have a material impact on amounts recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements.
In May 2005, the company created and funded a Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Trust (VEBA) for the purpose of funding benefit payments to participants in the companys postretirement benefit plans and severance payments to employees terminated under the companys current salaried headcount reduction. The company contributed $75.0 million to the VEBA in May 2005 and reflects this amount in prepaid and other current assets at May 29, 2005.
On December8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Part D) was signed into law. The law allows for a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the benefits established by the law. The company provides retiree drug benefits that exceed the value of the benefits that will be provided by Medicare PartD, and the retirees out-of-pocket costs are less than they would be under Medicare PartD. Therefore, the company has concluded that its plan is at least actuarially equivalent to the Medicare PartD plan and that it will be eligible for the subsidy. The company has reflected the impact of the subsidy by reducing its expense by $11.5million and $2.1 million in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. The company also reflected an unrecognized gain, which reduced its projected benefit 68 obligation by $51.6million at May 30, 2004.
The increase (decrease) in the minimum pension liability included in other comprehensive income was $4.8 million and $(17.6) million for the fiscal years ended May 29, 2005 and May 30, 2004, respectively.
The companys pension plan weighted-average asset allocations and the companys target asset allocations at February 28, 2005 and 2004, by asset category are as follows: 2005 2004 Target Allocation Equity   Securities 59 % 60 % 50-80 % Debt Securities 28 % 25 % 20-30 % Real Estate 5 % 5 % 0-8 % Other 8 % 10 % 0-20 % Total 100 % 100 % The companys investment strategy reflects the expectation that equity securities will outperform debt securities over the long term. Assets are invested in a prudent manner to maintain the security of funds while maximizing returns within the companys Investment Policy guidelines. The strategy is implemented utilizing indexed and actively managed assets from the categories listed.
The investment goals are to provide a total return that, over the long term, increases the ratio of plan assets to liabilities subject to an acceptable level of risk. This is accomplished through diversification of assets in accordance with the Investment Policy guidelines. Investment risk is mitigated by periodic rebalancing between asset classes as necessitated by changes in market conditions within the Investment Policy guidelines.
Equity securities include common stock of the company in the amounts of $134.8 million (7.1% of total pension plan assets) and $134.1 million (7.2% of total pension plan assets) at February 28, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The companys Investment Policy limits the investment in common stock of the company to 10% of the fair value of plan assets.
Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the benefit obligation of the postretirement plans.
Assumed   Health Care Cost Trend Rates at February 28 2005 2004 Initial health   care cost trend rate 9.0 % 10.0 % Ultimate health   care cost trend rate 5.0 % 5.0 % Year that the   rate reaches the ultimate trend rate 2011 2011 A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost rates would have the following effect: One Percent Increase One Percent Decrease Effect on total   service and interest cost $ 2.7 $ (2.8 ) Effect on   postretirement benefit obligation 32.7 (29.2 ) The company currently anticipates making contributions of $37.3 million to the pension plans in fiscal year 2006. This estimate is based on current tax laws, plan asset performance and liability assumptions, which are subject to change. The company anticipates making contributions of $42.8 million to the postretirement plan in fiscal 2006.
69 The following table presents estimated future gross benefit payments and Medicare Part D subsidy receipts for the companys plans: Health Care and Life Insuranc e Pension Benefits Benefit Payments Subsidy Receipts 2006 $ 107.6 $ 42.8 $ (1.0 ) 2007 111.1 42.1 (5.0 ) 2008 115.4 42.2 (5.0 ) 2009 120.4 41.7 (5.1 ) 2010 125.5 41.1 (5.0 ) Succeeding 5   years 719.4 184.3 (21.3 ) Certain employees of the company are covered under defined contribution plans. The expense related to these plans was $30.8 million, $31.6 million and $37.2 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
20. BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION The companys operations are organized into three reporting segments: Retail Products, Foodservice Products and Food Ingredients. The Retail Products reporting segment includes branded foods which are sold in various retail channels and include frozen, refrigerated and shelf-stable temperature classes. The Foodservice Products reporting segment includes branded and customized food products, including meals, entrees, prepared potatoes, meats, seafood, sauces and a variety of custom-manufactured culinary products packaged for sale to restaurants and other foodservice establishments. The Food Ingredients reporting segment includes both branded and commodity food ingredients, including milled grain ingredients, seasonings, blends and flavorings, which are sold to food processors, as well as certain commodity trading, sourcing and merchandising operations.
The companys fiscal year ends the last Sunday in May. The fiscal years for the consolidated financial statements presented consist of a 52-week period for fiscal year 2005, a 53-week period for fiscal year 2004 and a 52-week period for fiscal year 2003. The estimated impact on the companys results of operations due to the extra week in fiscal 2004 is additional net sales of approximately $281 million and additional segment operating profit of approximately $41 million.
On September 19, 2002 (during the companys second quarter of fiscal 2003), the company sold a controlling interest in its fresh beef and pork operations to a joint venture led by outside investors. As a result, the Meat Processing reporting segment information included beef and pork operating activity for fiscal 2003, but no activity for fiscal 2004 and 2005. Fiscal 2003 activity includes the settlement of an insurance claim related to a fire at a beef plant previously owned by the company in Garden City, Kansas. The insurance proceeds represented a recovery for the loss of facilities, inventory and related items. As a result of the settlement, the company recognized approximately $50 million in increased operating profit within the Meat Processing reporting segment for fiscal 2003.
Intersegment sales have been recorded at amounts approximating market. Operating profit for each segment is based on net sales less all identifiable operating expenses. General corporate expense, net interest expense, equity method investment earnings (loss) and income taxes have been excluded from segment operations.
During fiscal 2004, the company divested a minority share in a venture, receiving approximately $31.4 million. The company recognized a gain of approximately $21.2 million upon the divestiture, which is recognized as a reduction of corporate expenses.
Operating profit for fiscal 2005 at the Retail Products segment includes a $17.0 million benefit for favorable legal settlements partially offset by a $10.0 million charge for an impairment of a brand and related assets.
70 Operating profit for fiscal 2005 at the Foodservice Products segment includes a $10.0 million casualty loss from a fire at a production facility.
Operating profit for fiscal 2005 at the Food Ingredients segment includes a $15.0 million charge for the impairment of a manufacturing facility.

Foreign net sales were $1.3 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net sales are attributed to countries based on location of the customer. The companys long-lived assets located outside of the United States are not significant.
The companys largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores,Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 11% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2005, primarily in the Retail Products segment.

73 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of ConAgra Foods, Inc.
Omaha, Nebraska We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ConAgra Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of May 29, 2005 and May 30, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, common stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended May 29, 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ConAgra Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 29, 2005 and May 30, 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended May 29, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its methods of accounting for variable interest entities and asset retirement obligations in 2004 and changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in 2003.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of May 29, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 11, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting because of a material weakness.
/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Omaha, Nebraska August 11, 2005 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE On July 15, 2005, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of ConAgra Foods, Inc. determined it will dismiss Deloitte & Touche LLP (Deloitte & Touche) as the companys independent registered public accounting firm effective August 11, 2005, coinciding with the completion of the audit for the companys fiscal year ended May 29, 2005.
During the 2004 and 2005 fiscal years, there were no disagreements with Deloitte & Touche on any matter of accounting principle or practice, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to Deloitte & Touches satisfaction, would have caused Deloitte & Touche to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its report on the companys consolidated financial statements for such years.
74 There were no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K except for a material weakness in internal control with respect to accounting for income taxes as reported by the company in its Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2005, incorporated herein by reference.
On July 15, 2005, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of KPMG LLP (KPMG) to audit the Companys financial statements for the fiscal year ending May 28, 2006.
During the 2004 and 2005 fiscal years, and through July 15, 2005 the company has not consulted with KPMG with respect to any of the matters or reportable events set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
75 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures The companys management, with the participation of the companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the companys disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act as of May 29, 2005. Based on that evaluation, the companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, because of the material weakness in internal control discussed below, the companys disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of May 29, 2005.
During fiscal 2005, the company systematically conducted reviews of financial controls as part of its Sarbanes-Oxley 404 certification process and in connection with pending tax audits, as well as part of operational improvement efforts by new financial management. During the third and fourth quarters, those reviews resulted in the discovery of errors related to accounting for income taxes in previously reported amounts. To correct the errors discovered as a part of that process, and as announced in its Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 24, 2005, the company restated financial statements for the periods covered in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 30, 2004 and the Forms 10-Q for the first two quarters of fiscal 2005.
In connection with those restatements, the company concluded that a material weakness in internal control over accounting for income taxes existed as of February 27, 2005.
A material weakness in internal control is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company.
The principal factors contributing to the material weakness in accounting for income taxes were (1) inadequate levels of staffing and technical expertise within the companys tax department, (2) insufficient or ineffective tax-related review and approval practices , (3) inadequate processes to establish and effectively reconcile income tax accounts , and (4) inadequate analysis and application of tax planning strategies pursuant to SFAS No. 109.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Remediation Plans Progress has been made in implementing managements remediation plans including reorganization of the tax department, hiring of a new Vice President of Tax and other tax and tax accounting professionals, design of enhanced control processes over accounting for income taxes, implementation of certain enhanced control processes over accounting for income taxes, including general ledger account reconciliation processes, implementation of dual review procedures, and engagement of third party tax specialists to provide additional quality assurance.
In connection with the companys overall assessment of its internal control over financial reporting, the company has evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over accounting for income taxes as of May 29, 2005, and has concluded that, while progress has been made in implementing managements remediation plans, the material weakness in internal controls with respect to accounting for income taxes was not remediated as of May 29, 2005. T he companys management believes that further additions to its tax staff are necessary and further enhancements and refinements to its processes are necessary in order to remediate the material weakness.
The company will continue implementing managements remediation plans and will monitor the improvements in the controls over accounting for income taxes to ensure remediation of the material weakness.
Except for changes related to the material weakness described above, there has been no change during the companys fiscal quarter ended May 29, 2005 in the companys internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the companys internal control over financial reporting.
Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of ConAgra Foods is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. ConAgra Foods 76 internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. ConAgra Foods internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of ConAgra Foods; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of ConAgra Foods are being made only in accordance with the authorization of management and directors of ConAgra Foods; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of ConAgra Foods assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluations of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of the changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Boards Auditing Standard No. 2, a material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements would not be prevented or detected.
With the participation of ConAgra Foods Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management assessed the effectiveness of ConAgra Foods internal control over financial reporting as of May 29, 2005. In making this assessment, management used criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). As a result of this assessment, management determined that a material weakness related to accounting for income taxes existed as of May 29, 2005.
In connection with the companys overall assessment of its internal control over financial reporting, the company has evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over accounting for income taxes as of May 29, 2005, and has concluded that a material weakness in internal controls with respect to accounting for income taxes existed as of May 29, 2005.
Managements conclusion that the material weakness in accounting for income taxes existed as of May 29, 2005 was based on the following three factors: (1) inadequate levels of staffing and technical expertise within the companys tax department, (2) insufficient or ineffective tax-related review and approval practices, and (3) inadequate processes to establish and effectively reconcile income tax accounts. These deficiencies, in the aggregate, were determined to be a material weakness. Due to the misstatements which resulted in the restatement of the Companys previously issued 2002, 2003, and 2004 annual financial statements and its quarterly financial statements for the first two quarters of fiscal 2005 and the potential for additional misstatements from this material weakness, there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements would not be prevented or detected. As a result of the aforementioned material weakness, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of May 29, 2005.
Managements assessment of the effectiveness of ConAgra Foods internal control over financial reporting as of May 29, 2005 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their report below expresses an unqualified opinion on managements assessment and an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of ConAgra Foods internal control over financial reporting as of May 29, 2005, due to the material weakness.

Sklarsky Chairman and Chief Executive   Officer Executive Vice President,   Chief Financial Officer August 11, 2005 August 11, 2005 77 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of ConAgra Foods, Inc.
Omaha, Nebraska We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that ConAgra Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 29, 2005, because of the effect of the material weakness identified in managements assessment based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The following material weakness has been identified and included in managements assessment: the Company did not maintain adequate controls over accounting for income taxes. The deficiencies identified related to accounting for income taxes were (1) inadequate levels of staffing and technical expertise within the Companys tax department, (2) insufficient or ineffective tax-related review and approval practices, and (3) inadequate processes to establish and effectively reconcile income tax accounts. These deficiencies in the aggregate were determined to be a material weakness. The material 78 weakness resulted in errors related to accounting for income taxes in previously reported amounts which resulted in the restatement of the Companys previously issued 2002, 2003, and 2004 annual financial statements and its quarterly financial statements for the first two quarters of fiscal 2005.
Due to the misstatements which resulted in the restatement of the Companys financial statements and the potential for additional misstatements from this material weakness, there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements would not be prevented or detected. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended May 29, 2005, of the Company and this report does not affect our report on such financial statements and financial statement schedule.
In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 29, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 29, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended May 29, 2005, of the Company and our reports dated August 11, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.
