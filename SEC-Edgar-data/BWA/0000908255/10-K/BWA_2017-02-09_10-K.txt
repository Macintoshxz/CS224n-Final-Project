Net revenues by segment for the three years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 are as follows (in millions of dollars): Year       Ended December31, 2007 2006 2005 Engine $ 3,761.3 $ 3,154.9 $ 2,855.4 Drivetrain 1,598.8 1,461.4 1,472.9 Inter-segment eliminations (31.5 ) (30.9 ) (34.5 ) Net       sales $ 5,328.6 $ 4,585.4 $ 4,293.8 The sales information presented above excludes the sales by the Companys unconsolidated joint ventures (See Joint Ventures section). Such sales totaled approximately $720million in 2007, $676million in 2006 and $635million in 2005.
Engine The Engine Group develops products to manage engines for fuel efficiency, reduced emissions, and enhanced performance. Its products currently fall into the following major categories: turbochargers, chain products, emissions systems, thermal systems, diesel cold start and gasoline ignition technology and diesel cabin heaters.
The Engine Group provides turbochargers for light-vehicle, commercial-vehicle and off-road applications for diesel and gasoline engine manufacturers in Europe, North America, South America and Asia.The Engine Group has greatly benefited from the growth in turbocharger demand in Europe.This growth is linked to increasing demand for diesel engines in light vehicles which typically utilize turbochargers and for turbocharged gasoline engines.Benefits of turbochargers in both light-vehicle and commercial-vehicle applications include increased power for a given engine size, improved fuel economy and significantly reduced emissions.
Sales of turbochargers for light-vehicles represented approximately 21%, 18%, and 16% of the Companys total revenues for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company currently supplies light-vehicle turbochargers to many OEMs including Volkswagen,Renault, PSA, Daimler, Hyundai, Fiat and BMW. The Company also supplies commercial-vehicle turbochargers to Caterpillar, John Deere, Daimler, International, Deutz and MAN.
4 In 2005, the Company announced the start of production of its regulated two-stage turbocharging system known as R2S for medium diesel truck applications. The system provides continuously variable adaptation of the turbine and compressor side for every operating point of the engine The Company also announced it would supply turbochargers for VW/Audis 2.0 liter gasoline direct injection engine and for their first dual-charged 1.4 liter gasoline direct injection engine. In 2006, the Company launched a high temperature variableturbine geometry ("VTG") for a Porsche 3.6 litergasoline application, another R2S application for a Daimler light-truck calledthe Sprinter and a VTG for the Hyundai A-engine family. In 2007, the Company began supplying its R2S turbocharger technology combined with variable turbine geometry to International Engine Groups PowerStroke 6.4-liter V8 diesel engine used in Fords F-Series heavy-duty pickup trucks.Turbochargers are manufactured in facilities in Europe, North America, South America and Asia.
The Engine Group designs and manufactures products to control emissions and improve fuel economy.These products include electric air pumps, turbo actuators that use integrated electronics to precisely control turbocharger speed and pressure ratio, and exhaust gas recirculation valves for gasoline and diesel applications. The Engine Group also manufactures a wide variety of fluid pumps, including engine oil pumps for engine and transmission lubrication, and products for engine air intake management.These products are provided from facilities in North America, Europe and Asia.
The Engine Groupschain and chain systems productsinclude timing chain and timing drive systems, crankshaft and camshaft sprockets, tensioners, guides and snubbers, HY-VO  Front-Wheel Drive (FWD) transmission chain and Four-Wheel Drive (4WD) chain, and MORSE GEMINI  chain systems for light-vehicle and commercial-vehicle applications.
The Companys timing chain systems are used on Fords family of overhead cam engines, including the Duratech and Modular, and in-line 4 cylinder engines, as well as on Chryslers 2.7 liter, 3.7 liter and 4.7 liter, overhead cam engines,including the5.7 liter and 6.1 liter Hemi applications. In addition, the Company provides timing systems to a number of Asian OEMs and their North American transplant operations, including Honda, Nissan, and Hyundai, and to several European OEMs. The Company believes that it is the worlds leading manufacturer of timing chain systems.
The Engine Group has reached full production of its first high-volume variable cam timing (VCT) systems for a family of GM V6 engines. VCT is a means of precisely controlling the flow of air into and out of an engine by allowing the camshaft to be dynamically phased relative to its crankshaft. The Companys VCT system includes Torsional Assist technology, which utilizes camshaft torque as its main actuation energy, instead of the conventional oil-pressure actuated approach. The VCT systems are utilized by GMs 3.5 liter and 3.9 liter V-6 engines in the Saturn Aura, Chevrolet Impala and Pontiac G6. HY-VO chain is used to transfer power from the engine to the drivetrain. The Companys MORSE GEMINI chain system emits significantly less chain pitch frequency noise than conventional transmission chain systems. The chain in a transfer case distributes power between a vehicles front and rear output shafts which, in turn, provide torque to the front and rear wheels. The Company believes it is the worlds leading manufacturer of chain for FWD transmissions and 4WD transfer cases.These products are provided from facilities in North America, Europe and Asia.
The Engine Group believes it is a leading global provider of engine thermal solutions for truck, agricultural and off-highway applications.The group designs, manufactures and markets viscous fan drives that control fans to sense and respond to multiple cooling requirementsThe Engine Group also manufactures and markets polymer fans for engine cooling systems. The Companys thermal products provide improved vehicle fuel economy and reduced engine emissions while minimizing parasitic horsepower loss. These advanced thermal systems products are provided from facilities in North America, South America, Europe and Asia.The Company has been awarded the "standard position" (the OEM-designated preferred supplier of component systems available to the end-customer) at the major global heavy truck producers.
In 2005, the Company acquired approximately 69.4% of the outstanding shares of BERU Aktiengesellschaft (BERU), headquartered in Ludwigsburg, Germany. In 2007, the Company increased its ownership to approximately 82.2%. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companys Summary Annual Report. BERUs operating results are included within the Companys Engine Group segment. BERU is a leading global automotive supplier of diesel cold starting technology (glow plugs and instant starting systems); gasoline ignition 5 technology (spark plugs and ignition coils); and electronic control units and sensor technology (tire pressure sensors, diesel cabin heaters and selected sensors). BERU is represented in Europe, Asia and North America.
Drivetrain The Drivetrain Group leverages the Companys expertise in wet friction clutches, mechanical coupling devices, and control systems, enabling efficient transmission of engine torque to the vehicle drivetrain, and management of torque distribution to the driven wheels. The Drivetrain Groups major products are transmission components and systems, and 4WD and AWD torque management systems.
The Drivetrain Group designs and manufactures automatic transmission components and modules in North America, Asia and Europe. The Company is a supplier to virtually every major automatic transmission manufacturer in the world for both conventional automatics and new dual-clutch transmissions.
Shift quality products are provided in four principal categories.Dual-clutch transmission products include dual-clutch modules, torsional vibration dampers and mechatronic control modules.Friction products include friction plates, transmission bands, torque converter clutches, and friction clutch modules.
One-way clutches and torsional vibration dampers are mechanical products.The controls products line features electro-hydraulic solenoids, solenoid modules and high pressure solenoids for automated manual transmissions ("AMT"s).
The Companys 50%-owned joint venture in Japan, NSK-Warner Kabushiki Kaisha ("NSK-Warner"), is a leading producer of friction plates and one-way clutches in Japan. NSK-Warner is also the joint venture partner with a 40% interest in the Drivetrain Groups Korean subsidiary, BorgWarner Transmission Systems Korea, Inc.
The Company has led the globalization of todays dual-clutch transmission technology for over ten years.Following the development of its dual-clutch transmission technology in the 1990s, the Company established its industry-leading position in Europe in 2003 with the production launch of its award-winning DualTronic innovations with VW/Audi.In 2006, the Company was awarded the first dual-clutch program in China with SAIC.In 2007, the Company announced its first North American program and launched its first dual-clutch technology application in a Japanese transmission with Nissan.
The Company has announced programs with customers that include VW, Audi, Bugatti, SAIC, Nissan, and Getrag dual-clutch transmission programs with five additional global automakers. In addition, the Company is working on over 20 programs with OEMs around the world.BorgWarner DualTronic technology provides both better fuel-efficiency and a great driving experience, enabling a conventional, manual gearbox to function as a fully automatic transmission by eliminating the interruption that occurs when a manual transmission shifts gears.
In conventional automatic transmissions, there has been a global market trend from four and five speeds to six, seven, and even eight speed transmissions. Transmissions with more speeds improve fuel economy and vehicle performance and offer the Company growth opportunities.
In 2006 the Drivetrain Group acquired the high-pressure solenoid product lines of Eaton Corporation. Among these solenoids are those used in AMTs. AMTs are a growing niche of the entry-level city-car and light commercial-vehicle segments in Europe and some Asian markets.
The Drivetrain Group's torque management products include rear-wheel drive (RWD)/all-wheel drive (AWD) transfer cases and systems, and frontwheel drive (FWD)/ all-wheel drive (AWD) electromagnetic couplings and systems to transfer torque within the drivetrain. The companys focus is on electronically controlled (active) torque management devices and systems. Other torque management products include synchronizer rings and systems for application in manual, automated manual and dual clutch transmissions.
Transfer cases are installed primarily on light-trucks, sport-utility vehicles ("SUV"s), and rear-wheel drive based cross-over utility vehicles ("CUV"s) and passenger cars. A transfer case attaches to the transmission and distributes torque to the front and rear axles improving vehicle traction and stability in dynamic driving conditions. The Company pioneered the first active on-demand all-wheel drive system, Torque-on-Demand (TOD) transfer case technology, revolutionizing the all-wheel drive market. On-demand systems created a 6 completely new genre of transfer cases, focusing on accurately managing torque and allowing vehicle driveline downsizing and efficiency gains. The TOD transfer case has become an industry standard known around the world. Over five million TOD transfer cases have been manufactured by the Company and used in vehicles produced by Ford, Isuzu, KIA, GM and SAIC (Ssangyong).The latest product evolution within the TOD transfer case family is the ITM transfer case launched in 2007 on the all-new Cadillac CTS.
Sales of rear-wheel drive based transfer cases and components represented approximately 9%, 10% and 12% of the Companys total revenues for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.The Company supplies the majority of the transfer cases used by Ford, including those installed in the Ford Explorer, the Ford Expedition, the Ford F-150, Ranger pick-up trucks, the Mercury Mountaineer and the Lincoln Navigator. The Company also supplies transfer cases to a number of General Motors applications including the Hummer H2 and H3; the Cadillac Escalade, CTS, STS and SRX; and the GMC Yukon Denali. The Company began supplying transfer cases for the Audi Q7 in 2005 and to Great Wall Motor Company Limited, a leading light-truck and SUV manufacturer in China, in 2006. The Company also supplies transfer cases to several other Asia-based OEMs.
The Company is actively involved in the FWD, AWD market with the i-Trac series products developed for FWD based CUVs, SUVs, and passenger cars. The i-Trac series electromagnetic couplings use electronically controlled clutches to distribute power to the rear wheels instantaneously as traction is required. The Company has produced over 1 million i-Trac series products under the brand names of ITM I and T-Trac for vehicles produced by Hyundai, KIA, and Honda. A derivative of this electronically controlled clutch incorporating a third friction element, known as ITM 3e, went into production on the 2006 Porsche 911 Turbo, Hyundai Santa Fe, Chrysler Pacifica, and all-new Dodge Journey.NexTrac is the latest product innovation in the i-Trac series. It is an active on-demand all-wheel drive system that produces outstanding stability and traction while promoting better fuel economy through a more compact, lighter, and efficient package. In 2007, the Company was selected by Chery Automobile Company, in China, as the driveline system integrator for a new all-wheel drive SUV, which will feature the Companys patented NexTrac technology along with the Companys control systems. As a driveline integrator, the Company will specify system requirements and coordinate design and execution to provide a competitive edge in the marketplace.Additional applications of NexTrac will launch in early 2008 on a top five CUV program with an Asian car manufacturer.
The Companys drivetrain products are manufactured in North America, Europe and Asia.
Joint Ventures As of December31, 2007, the Company had 12joint ventures in which it had a less-than-100% ownership interest. Results from the seven ventures in which the Company is the majority owner are consolidated as part of the Companys results.

Financial Information About Geographic Areas See Note20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companys Summary Annual Report for financial information about geographic areas, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Approximately 66% of the Companys consolidated sales for 2007 was outside the United States, including exports. However, a portion of such sales was to OEMs headquartered outside the United States that produce vehicles that are, in turn, exported to the United States.
Customers Approximately 73% of the Companys total sales in 2007 was for light-vehicle applications, with the remaining 27% of the Companys sales to a diversified group of commercial truck, bus, construction and agricultural vehicle manufacturers, and to distributors of aftermarket replacement parts.
For the most recent three-year period, the Companys worldwide sales to the following customers were approximately as follows: Customer 2007 2006 2005 Volkswagen 15% 13% 13% Ford 12% 13% 16% Daimler 6% 11% 12% Daimler divested Chrysler in 2007.No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated sales in any year of the periods presented.
8 The Companys automotive products are generally sold directly to OEMs substantially pursuant to negotiated annual contracts, long-term supply agreements or terms and conditions as may be modified by the parties. Deliveries are subject to periodic authorizations based upon the production schedules of the OEMs. The Company typically ships its products directly from its plants to the OEMs.
Sales and Marketing Each of the Companys business units within its two reporting segments has its own sales function. Account executives for each of our business units are assigned to serve specific OEM customers for one or more of a business units products. Our account executives spend the majority of their time in direct contact with OEM purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible for servicing existing business and for identifying and obtaining new business. Because of their close relationship with OEMs, account executives are able to identify and meet customers needs based upon their knowledge of our customers needs and our products and design and manufacturing capabilities. Upon securing a new order, account executives participate in product launch team activities and serve as a key interface with the customers.
In addition, the sales and marketing employees of our Engine segment and Drivetrain segment often work together to explore cross-development opportunities for the business units. The development of DualTronic, the Companys wet-clutch and control-system technology for a new-concept automated transmission, is an example of a successful collaboration.
Seasonality The Companys business is moderately seasonal because the Companys largest North American customers typically halt vehicle production for approximately two weeks in July and one week in December. Additionally, customers in Europe and Asia typically shut down vehicle production during portions of July or August and one week in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, the Companys third and fourth quarters may reflect those practices.
Research and Development The Company conducts advanced engine and drivetrain research at the segment level. This advanced engineering function looks to leverage electronics and the Companys expertise across product lines to create new engine and drivetrain systems and modules that can be commercialized. A venture capital fund that was created by the Company as seed money for new innovation and collaboration across businesses is managed by this function.
In addition, each of the Companys operating segments has its own research and development (R&D) organization. The Company has approximately 800employees, including engineers, mechanics and technicians, engaged in R&D activities at facilities worldwide. The Company also operates testing facilities such as prototype, measurement and calibration, life cycle testing and dynamometer laboratories.
By working closely with the OEMs and anticipating their future product needs, the Companys R&D personnel conceive, design, develop and manufacture new proprietary automotive components and systems. R&D personnel also work to improve current products and production processes. The Company believes its commitment to R&D will allow it to obtain new orders from its OEM customers.
The following table presents the Company's gross and net expenditures on R&Dactivities: millions       of dollars Year       Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Gross       R&D expenditures $ 246.7 $ 219.5 $ 194.3 Customer       reimbursements (       35.9 ) (31.8 ) (33.3 ) Net       R&D expenditures $ 210.8 $ 187.7 $ 161.0 9 The Company's net R&D expenditures are included in the selling, general, and administrative expenses of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Customer reimbursements are netted against gross R&D expenditures upon billing of services performed. The Company has contracts with several customers at the Company's various R&D locations. No such contract exceeded $6.0 million in any of the years presented.
Patents and Licenses The Company has approximately 3,800 active domestic and foreign patents and patent applications pending or under preparation, and receives royalties from licensing patent rights to others. While it considers its patents on the whole to be important, the Company does not consider any single patent, any group of related patents or any single license essential to its operations in the aggregate or to the operations of any of the Companys business groups individually. The expiration of the patents individually and in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position or future operating results. The Company owns numerous trademarks, some of which are valuable, but none of which are essential to its business in the aggregate.
The Company owns the BorgWarner and Borg-Warner Automotive trade names and housemarks, and variations thereof, which are material to the Companys business.
Competition The Companys operating segments compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors which produce and sell similar products. Many of these competitors are larger and have greater resources than the Company. Price, quality, delivery, technological innovation, application engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition.
The Companys major competitors by product type follow: Product       Type: Engine Name       of Competitor Turbochargers: Honeywell Mitsubishi       Heavy Industries (MHI) IHI Chains: Tsubaki       Group Iwis Schaeffler       Group Emissions       products: Pierburg Valeo Bosch Thermal products: Behr Horton/Sachs Usui Diesel cold start technology: Bosch NGK Product Type:       Drivetrain Name of       Competitor Torque       transfer products: Magna JTEKT GKN Transmission products: Dynax Schaeffler       Group Bosch Denso In addition, a number of the Companys major OEM customers manufacture, for their own use and for others, products which compete with the Companys products. Although these OEM customers have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers, the OEMs could elect to manufacture products to meet their own requirements or to compete with the Company. There can be no assurance that the Companys business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates.
10 For many of its products, the Companys competitors include suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs and, in some cases, export subsidies and/or raw materials subsidies. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Employees As of December31, 2007, the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries had approximately 17,700 salaried and hourly employees (as compared with approximately 17,400 employees at December31, 2006), of which approximately 6,700 were U.S.employees.Approximately 25% of the Companys U.S.workforce is unionized. The hourly employees at certain of our international facilities are also unionized. The Company believes its present relations with employees to be satisfactory.
Our two most significant domestic collective bargaining agreements are for our Muncie, Indiana plant and our Ithaca and Cortland, New Yorkfacilities. The Muncie agreement expires in April 2009.Workers at the New York facilities elected a new union in December 2007.It is expected that both parties will bargain in good faith beginning in the first quarter of 2008.It is our expectation that an agreement will be reached, though no assurances can be given.
Raw Materials Continuing a trend which began in 2004, several raw materials used in the Companys products hit record pricing levels in 2007, including steel, copper, resins, nickel and certain alloying elements. This was due to a host of supply and demand factors.
Despite these challenges, the Company used a variety of tactics in order to limit the impact of inflationary prices and supply shortages. The Company formed a global procurement organization to accelerate: cost reductions, purchases from lower cost regions, risk mitigation efforts, and collaborative buying activities. In addition, the Company used long-term contracts, cost sharing arrangements, design changes, customer buy programs, and hedging instruments to help control costs. The Company intends to use similar measures in 2008 and beyond.See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companys Summary Annual Report.
For 2008, the Company believes that its supplies of raw materials and energy are adequate and available from multiple sources to support its manufacturing requirements. Manufacturing operations for each of the Companys operating segments are dependent upon natural gas, fuel oil, and electricity.
Environmental Regulation and Proceedings The Company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties ("PRPs") at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("Superfund") and equivalent state laws and, as such, may presently be liable for the cost of clean-up and other remedial activities at 34 such sites. Responsibility for clean-up and other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.
The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not large or the liability will be shared withother PRPs, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.
Based on information available to the Company (which in most cases includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large, solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to them; currently available information from PRPs and/or federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs; remediation alternatives; and estimated legal fees), the Company has established an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance at December 31, 2007 of $14.5 million. Excluding the Crystal Springs site discussed below for which $4.9 million has been accrued, the Company has accrued amounts that do not 11 exceed $3.0 million related to any individual site and management does not believe that the costs related to any of these other individual sites will have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. The Company expects to pay out substantially all of the amountsaccrued for environmental liability over the next three to five years.
In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric Corporation, the Company agreed to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for certain environmental liabilities then unknown to the Company relating to certain operations of Kuhlman Electric that pre-date the Company's 1999 acquisition of Kuhlman Electric. During 2000, Kuhlman Electric notified the Company that it discovered potential environmental contamination at its Crystal Springs, Mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant. The Company is continuing to work with the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and Kuhlman Electric to investigate and remediate to the extent necessary,historical contamination at the plant and surrounding area. Kuhlman Electric and others, including the Company, were sued in numerous related lawsuits, in which multiple claimants alleged personal injury and property damage.In 2005, the Company and other defendants entered into settlements that resolved approximately 99% of the then known personal injury and property damage claims relating to the alleged environmental contamination. Those settlements involved payments by the Company of $28.5 million in the second half of 2005 and $15.7 million in the first quarter of 2006, in exchange for, among other things, the dismissal with prejudice ofthese lawsuits.
In December 2007, a lawsuit was filed against Kuhlman Electric and others, including the Company, on behalf of approximately 209 plaintiffs, alleging personal injury relating to alleged environmental contamination.Given the early stage of the litigation, the Company cannot make any prediction as to the outcome but its current intention is to vigorously defend against the suit.

13 Item1A.Risk Factors Our industry is cyclical and our results of operations will be adversely affected by industry downturns.
Automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors. Significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have a material adverse effect on our sales to original equipment manufacturers and our financial position, operating results and cash flows.
We are dependent on sport-utility vehicle and light-truck market segments and are affected by decreasing demand in those segments.
Some of our products, in particular four-wheel drive transfer cases, are currently used in four-wheel drive systems primarily for sport-utility vehicles and light-trucks.Any significant reduction in production in this market segment or loss of business in this market segment could have a material adverse effect on our sales to original equipment manufacturers and our financial position, operating results and cash flows.
We face strong competition.
We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours. Price, quality and technological innovation are the primary elements of competition. Our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major original equipment manufacturer customers, as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers. We are not as large as a number of these companies and do not have as many financial or other resources. The competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as our traditional U.S. original equipment manufacturer customers, faced with intense international competition, have expanded their worldwide sourcing of components. As a result, we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages, such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs and, in some cases, export or raw materials subsidies. Increased competition could adversely affect our businesses.
We are under substantial pressure from original equipment manufacturers to reduce the prices of our products.
There is substantial and continuing pressure on original equipment manufacturers to reduce costs, including costs of products we supply. Although original equipment manufacturers have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers, a number of our major original equipment manufacturer customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products. These original equipment manufacturers could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply. We believe that our ability to develop proprietary new products and to control our costs will allow us to remain competitive. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to improve or maintain our gross margins on product sales to original equipment manufacturers or that the recent trend by original equipment manufacturers towards increased outsourcing will continue.
Annual price reductions to original equipment manufacturer customers appear to have become a permanent feature of our business environment. In 2007, the combination of price reductions to customers and cost increases for material, labor and overhead, totaled approximately $136 million. To maintain our profit margins, we seek price reductions from our suppliers, improve production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency, update product designs to reduce costs and develop new products, the benefits of which support stable or increased prices. Our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our original equipment manufacturer customers is limited, with cost recovery less than 100% and often on a delayed basis. We cannot assure you that we will be able to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions and increases in raw material costs.
14 We are sensitive to the effects of our major customers labor relations.
All three of our primary North American customers, Ford, Chrysler and General Motors, have major union contracts with the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America. Because of domestic original equipment manufacturers dependence on a single union, we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at original equipment manufacturers facilities. Similarly, a majority of our global customers operations outside of North America are also represented by various unions. Any extended work stoppage could have an adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows.
Part of our labor force is unionized.
As of December 31, 2007, approximately 25% of our U.S. workforce was unionized. Our two most significant domestic collective bargaining agreements are for our Muncie, Indiana plant and our Ithaca and Cortland, New Yorkfacilities. The Muncie agreement expires in April 2009.Workers at the New York facilities elected a new union in December 2007.It is expected that both parties will bargain in good faith beginning in the first quarter 2008.It is our expectation that an agreement will be reached though no assurances can be given.The hourly employees at certain of our international facilities are also unionized. While we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, a prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows.
We are subject to extensive environmental regulations.
Our operations are subject to laws governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharges to waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. We believe that our business, operations and activities have been and are being operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and health and safety laws. However, the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result. Furthermore, through various acquisitions over the years, we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur materials costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws that may be adopted in the future.
We believe that the overall impact of compliance with regulations and legislation protecting the environment will not have a material adverse effect on our future financial position, operating results and cash flows, but we cannot assure you that this will always be the case. Capital expenditures and expenses in 2007 attributable to compliance with environmental laws were not material.
Wehave contingent liabilities related toenvironmental, product warranties,regulatory matters, litigation and other claims.
We and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and equivalent state laws. As a result, as of December 31, 2007, we may be liable for the cost of clean-up and other remedial activities at 34 of these sites.
We work with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites. The ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability. Management's estimate of the loss range for 2007 is between $14.4 million and $25.1 million. We record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined; in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range. Based on information available to us, we have established an accrual in our financial statements for indicated environmental liabilities, including our conditional asset retirement obligation under FIN 47, with a total balance of$15.5 million at December 31, 2007. We currently expect the substantial portion of this amount to be expended over the next three to five years.
15 We believe that none of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our future financial position or operating results, either because estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not large or because liability will be shared with other potentially responsible parties. However, we cannot assure you of the ultimate outcome.
We provide warranties to our customers for some of our products. Under these warranties, we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products. We cannot assure you that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material, or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such warranties in our financial statement.
Based upon information available to us, we have established an accrual in our financial statements for product warranties of$70.1 million at December 31, 2007.
We are also party to, or have an obligation to defend a party to, various legal proceedings, including those described in Note 14 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Summary Annual Report. Although we believe that none of these matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or future operating results, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any such matter or proceeding.
Our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful.
We have a stated goal of increasing revenues and operating revenues at a rate greater than global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions. We may not meet our goal because of any of the following: (a)the failure to develop new products which will be purchased by our customers; (b) technology changes rendering our products obsolete; (c)a reversal of the trend of supplying systems (which allows us to increase content per vehicle) instead of components; and (d) the failure to find suitable acquisition targets or the failure to integrate operations of acquired businesses quickly and cost effectively.
We are subject to risks related to our international operations.
We have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions and countries, including North America, Europe, China, India, South Korea, Japan, and Brazil and sell our products worldwide. For 2007, approximately 66% of our sales were outside North America. Consequently, our results could be affected by changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, trade restrictions or prohibitions, import or other charges or taxes, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changing economic conditions, and political instability and disputes. See Note 20 to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Summary Annual Report.
We may not realize sales represented by awarded business.
We base our growth projections, in part, on commitments made by our customers. These commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle. If actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments, it could adversely affect on our growth and financial performance.
We are impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post employment benefits.
The automotive industry, like other industries, continues to be impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post employment benefits. To partially address this impact, we announced adjustments to certain retiree medical and pension plans to be effective January 1, 2009.See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Summary Annual Report.
Certain defined benefit pension plans we sponsor are currently underfunded.
We sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans worldwide that are underfunded and will require cash payments. Additionally, if the performance of the assets in our pension plans does not meet our expectations, or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, our required contributions may be higher than we expect. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Summary Annual Report.
16 Negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations.
Adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could adversely affect our financial performance.
Additionally, we are subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in the U.S. and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions.Because the results of tax audits are inherently uncertain, negative or unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could adversely affect our financial performance.
We rely on sales to major customers.
Our worldwide sales in 2007 to Volkswagen and Fordconstituted approximately 15% and 12%, respectively, of our 2007 consolidated sales. Credit rating agencies rate one of these customers below investment grade. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated sales in 2007. The loss of a major customer could adversely affect our financial performance.
Economic distress of suppliers could result in disruption of our operations and have a material effect on our business.
Some automotive parts suppliers continue to experience cost pressures and the effects of industry overcapacity. These factors have increased pressure on the industry's supply base, as suppliers cope with higher commodity costs, lower production volumes and other challenges. The Company receives certain of itsraw materialsfrom sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers. The inability of a supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could adversely affect our future financial performance.
Increase in the cost of raw materials could harm our business.
We use various raw materials in our business such as nickel, aluminum, magnesium, copper, plastic resins, molybdenum and others.The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions.In recent years, we have experienced increases in freight charges and energy costs as well.Substantial changes in these prices affect our operating costs, and to the extent they cannot be recouped through price increases to our customers, could reduce our profitability.
Item1B.Unresolved Staff Comments The Company has received no written comments regarding its periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that were issued 180days or more preceding the end of its 2007 fiscal year and that remain unresolved.
Item2.Properties As of December31, 2007, the Company had 64 manufacturing, assembly, and technical locationsworldwide. In addition to its 15 U.S.manufacturing locations, the Company has 10 locations in Germany, five locations in each of India and Korea, three locations in each of the United Kingdom, France and China,two locations in each of Japan, Mexico, Hungary, and Italy, and one location in each of Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Monaco, Spain, and Taiwan. The Company also has several sales offices, warehouses and technical centers. The Companys worldwide headquarters are located in a leased facility in Auburn Hills, Michigan. In 2002, the Company completed construction of the BorgWarner Powertrain Technical Center (the PTC) in Auburn Hills, Michigan, which serves as a primary research and development facility and contains many of the administrative personnel for the Engine and Drivetrain segments. There are approximately 500 employees located at the PTC. In general, the Company believes its facilities to be suitable and adequate to meet its current and reasonably anticipated needs. The majority of the locations are operating at normal levels based on capacity.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to a number of claims and judicial and administrative proceedings (some of which involve substantial amounts) arising out of the Companys business or relating to matters for which the Company may have a contractual indemnity obligation. See Note14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companys Summary Annual Report for a discussion of environmental, asbestos and other litigation, which is incorporated herein by reference.
18 A declaratory judgment action was filed by a subsidiary of the Company, BorgWarner Diversified Transmission Products Inc. (DTP), in January 2006 in the United Stated District Court, Southern District of Indiana, Indianapolis Division, against the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implements Workers of America, Local No.287 and Gerald Poor, individually and as the representative of a defendant class. DTP is seeking the Courts affirmation that DTP did not violate the Labor-Management Relations Act or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by amending certain retirees medical plans, effective March12, 2006. DTP believes that it is within its rights to amend the plan and that it will be successful on the merits of the lawsuit, although there can be no guarantee of success in any litigation.

Item9A. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed toprovide reasonable assurancethat information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Form10-K, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periodsspecified in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required under Exchange Act Rule13a-15, the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15(f). The Company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Management conducted an assessment of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December31, 2007, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. The Company's management report on internal control over financial reporting is set forth on pages 25 - 26 of the Company's Summary Annual Report and is incorporated herein by this reference.
The Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be 21 considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of error or fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
Deloitte and Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Companys consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 as stated in their report below.
Changes in Internal Control There have been nochanges in internal controls over the financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.
Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm 22 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BorgWarner Inc.: Auburn Hills, Michigan We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December31, 2007 of the Company and our report dated February14, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company's changes in its methods of accounting in 2007 for income taxes as a result of adopting FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.
