Business Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (Berkshire, Company or Registrant) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities. The most important of these are insurance businesses conducted on both a primary basis and a reinsurance basis. Berkshire also owns and operates a large number of other businesses engaged in a variety of activities, as identified herein. Berkshire is domiciled in the state of Delaware, and its corporate headquarters is located in Omaha, Nebraska.
Berkshires operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by Berkshires corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Berkshires corporate office management participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses.
Insurance and Reinsurance Businesses Berkshires insurance and reinsurance business activities are conducted through approximately 70 domestic and foreign-based insurance entities. Berkshires insurance businesses provide insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks world-wide and also reinsure life, accident and health risks world-wide.
In primary (or direct) insurance activities, the insurer assumes the risk of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. Such risks may relate to property, casualty (or liability), life, accident, health, financial or other perils that may arise from an insurable event. In reinsurance activities, the reinsurer assumes defined portions of risks that other primary insurers or reinsurers have assumed in their own insuring activities.
Reinsurance contracts are normally classified as treaty or facultative contracts. Treaty reinsurance refers to reinsurance coverage for all or a portion of a specified class of risks ceded by the primary insurer, while facultative reinsurance involves coverage of specific individual risks. Reinsurance contracts are further classified as quota-share or excess. Under quota-share (proportional or pro-rata) reinsurance, the reinsurer shares proportionally in the original premiums, losses and expenses of the primary insurer or reinsurer. Excess (or non-proportional) reinsurance provides for the indemnification of the primary insurer or reinsurer for all or a portion of the loss in excess of an agreed upon amount or retention. Both quota-share and excess reinsurance may provide for aggregate limits of indemnification.
Except for regulatory considerations, there are virtually no barriers to entry into the insurance and reinsurance industry. Competitors may be domestic or foreign, as well as licensed or unlicensed. The number of competitors within the industry is not known. Insurers and reinsurers compete on the basis of reliability, financial strength and stability, ratings, underwriting consistency, service, business ethics, price, performance, capacity, policy terms and coverage conditions.
Insurers and reinsurers based in the United States are subject to regulation by their state of domicile and by those states in which they are licensed or write policies on a non-admitted basis. The primary focus of regulation is to assure that insurers are financially solvent and that policyholder interests are otherwise protected. States establish minimum capital levels for insurance companies and establish guidelines for permissible business and investment activities. States have the authority to suspend or revoke a companys authority to do business, as conditions warrant. States regulate the payment of dividends by insurance companies to their shareholders. Dividends and capital distributions of extraordinary amounts are subject to prior regulatory approval.
Insurers may market, sell and service insurance policies in the states that they are licensed. These insurers are referred to as admitted insurers. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their policy forms and premium rates. Non-admitted insurance markets have developed to provide insurance that is otherwise unavailable from the admitted insurance markets of a state. Non-admitted insurance, often referred to as excess and surplus lines, is procured by either state-licensed surplus lines brokers who place risks with insurers not licensed in that state or by insureds direct procurement from non-admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance is subject to considerably less regulation with respect to policy rates and forms. Reinsurers are normally not required to obtain regulatory approval of premium rates and policy forms.
The insurance regulators of every state participate in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The NAIC adopts forms, instructions and accounting procedures for use by U.S. insurers and reinsurers in preparing and filing annual statutory financial statements. However, an insurers state of domicile has ultimate authority over these matters. In 1 Table of Contents addition to its activities relating to the annual statement, the NAIC develops or adopts statutory accounting principles, model laws, regulations and programs for use by its members. Such matters deal with regulatory oversight of solvency, compliance with financial regulation standards and risk-based capital reporting requirements.
Berkshires insurance companies maintain capital strength at exceptionally high levels. This strength differentiates Berkshires insurance companies from their competitors. Collectively, the aggregate statutory surplus of Berkshires U.S. based insurers was approximately $94 billion at December31, 2010. All of Berkshires major insurance subsidiaries are rated AA+ by Standard& Poors Corporation, and nearly all are currently rated A++ (superior) by A.M. Best with respect to their financial condition and operating performance.
The insurance industry experienced severe losses from the September11, 2001 terrorist attack. As a result, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, which established within the Department of the Treasury a Terrorism Insurance Program (Program) for commercial property and casualty insurers by providing federal reinsurance of insured terrorism losses was signed into law. The Program has subsequently been extended to December31, 2014 through other Acts, most recently the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007. Hereinafter these Acts are collectively referred to as TRIA. Under TRIA, the Department of the Treasury is charged with certifying acts of terrorism as having been a terrorist act undertaken on behalf of a foreign person or interest which resulted in an insured loss in excess of $5 million. TRIA currently establishes that the industry insured loss for a certified event must exceed $100 million. To be eligible for federal reinsurance, insurers must make available insurance coverage for acts of terrorism, by providing policyholders with clear and conspicuous notice of the amount of premium that will be charged for this coverage and of the federal share of any insured losses resulting from any act of terrorism. Assumed reinsurance is specifically excluded from TRIA participation. TRIA currently also excludes certain forms of direct insurance (such as commercial auto, burglary, theft, surety and certain professional liability lines). Terrorism exclusions that were contained within reinsurance contracts remain in effect. Reinsurers are not required to offer terrorism coverage and are not eligible for federal reinsurance of terrorism losses.
In the event of a certified act of terrorism, the federal government will reimburse insurers (conditioned on their satisfaction of policyholder notification requirements) for 85% of their insured losses in excess of an insurance groups deductible. Under the Program currently in effect, the deductible is 20% of the aggregate direct subject earned premium for relevant commercial lines of business in the immediately preceding calendar year. The aggregate deductible in 2011 for Berkshires consolidated insurance and reinsurance businesses will be approximately $300 million. There is also an aggregate limit of $100 billion on the amount of the federal government coverage for each TRIA year.
For many years, the insurance industry has been subject to personal injury claims arising from exposure to asbestos. The magnitude of such losses has caused many manufacturers to file for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Over the years, large numbers of asbestos related claims have been filed, including claims based upon exposure to asbestos, even though no related illness has been identified. Consequently, the U.S. Congress has periodically introduced legislation to assure that resources are available to indemnify claimants suffering from asbestos-related illnesses and to manage the overall cost of those claims. To date, no legislation has passed. It is highly uncertain as to whether or not any legislation will be enacted and, if enacted, how the provisions of such laws will affect Berkshire.
Regulation of the insurance industry outside of the United States is subject to the differing laws and regulations of each country in which the insurer has operations or writes premiums. Some jurisdictions impose complex regulatory requirements on insurance businesses while other jurisdictions impose fewer requirements. In certain foreign countries, reinsurers are required to be licensed by governmental authorities. These licenses may be subject to modification, suspension or revocation dependent on such factors as amount and types of reserves and minimum capital and solvency tests. The violation of regulatory requirements may result in fines, censures and/or criminal sanctions in various jurisdictions. Berkshire subsidiaries have historically provided insuring capacity to insurance syndicates at Lloyds of London. Such capacity entitles the Berkshire subsidiaries to a share of the risks and rewards of the activities of the syndicates in proportion to the amount of capacity provided. This business is subject to regulation by the U.K.s Financial Services Authority which maintains comprehensive rules and regulations covering the legal, financial and operating activities of managing agents and syndicates.
Berkshires insurance underwriting operations are comprised of the following sub-groups: (1)GEICO and its subsidiaries, (2)General Re and its subsidiaries, (3)Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group and (4)Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Except for certain retroactive reinsurance products that generate significant amounts of up-front premiums along with estimated claims expected to be paid over very long periods of time creating float (see Investments section below), Berkshire expects to achieve a net underwriting profit over time and reject inadequately priced risks. Underwriting profit is earned premiums less associated incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting and policy acquisition expenses. Underwriting profit does 2 Table of Contents not include investment income earned from investments, including investments of float. Berkshires insurance subsidiaries employ approximately 30,000 persons in the aggregate. Additional information related to each of Berkshires four underwriting groups follows.
GEICO GEICO is headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland and its principal insurance subsidiaries include: Government Employees Insurance Company, GEICO General Insurance Company, GEICO Indemnity Company and GEICO Casualty Company. These companies primarily offer private passenger automobile insurance to individuals in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In addition, GEICO insures motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, recreational vehicles and small commercial fleets and acts as an agent for other insurers who offer homeowners, boat and life insurance to individuals. GEICO markets its policies primarily through direct response methods in which applications for insurance are submitted directly to the companies via the Internet or by telephone.
GEICO competes for private passenger auto insurance customers with other companies that sell directly to the customer as well as with companies that use a traditional agency sales force. The automobile insurance business is highly competitive in the areas of price and service. Some insurance companies exacerbate price competition by selling their products for a period of time at less than adequate rates. This arises as a result of underestimating ultimate claim costs and/or overestimating the amount of investment income expected to be earned from the cash flow generated as a result of premiums being received before claims are paid. GEICO will not knowingly follow that strategy.
As a result of an aggressive advertising campaign and competitive rates, voluntary policies-in-force have increased about 49% over the past five years. GEICO is currently the third largest private passenger auto insurer in the United States in terms of premium volume. According to A.M. Best, the five largest automobile insurers have a combined market share of about 50%, with GEICOs current market share being 8.8%. Seasonal variations in GEICOs insurance business are not significant. However, extraordinary weather conditions or other factors may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity of automobile claims.
Private passenger auto insurance is stringently regulated by state insurance departments. As a result, it is difficult for insurance companies to differentiate their products. Competition for preferred-risk private passenger automobile insurance, which is substantial, tends to focus on price and level of customer service provided. Price tends to be the primary focus for other risks. GEICOs cost-efficient direct response marketing methods and emphasis on customer satisfaction enable it to offer competitive rates and value to its customers. GEICO primarily uses its own claims staff to manage and settle claims.
The name and reputation of GEICO is a material asset and management protects it and other service marks through appropriate registrations.
General Re General Re Corporation (General Re) is the holding company of General Reinsurance Corporation (GRC) and its subsidiaries and affiliates. GRCs subsidiaries include General Reinsurance AG (formerly Klnische RckversicherungsGesellschaft AG (Cologne Re)), a major international reinsurer based in Germany. GRC increased its ownership in General Reinsurance AG during 2009 from 95% to 100%. General Re subsidiaries currently conduct business activities globally in 56 cities and provide insurance and reinsurance coverages throughout the world. General Re provides property/casualty insurance and reinsurance, life/health reinsurance and other reinsurance intermediary and risk management, underwriting management and investment management services. GeneralRe is one of the largest reinsurers in the world based on premium volume and shareholder capital.
Property/Casualty Reinsurance General Res property/casualty reinsurance business in North America is conducted through GRC domiciled in Delaware and licensed in the District of Columbia and all states but Hawaii where it is an accredited reinsurer. Property/casualty operations in North America are headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and are also conducted through 16 branch offices in the U.S. and Canada. Reinsurance activities are marketed directly to clients without involving a broker or intermediary. Coverages are written primarily on an excess basis and under treaty and facultative contracts. In 2010, approximately 30% of net written premiums in North America related to casualty reinsurance coverages and 54% related to property reinsurance coverages.
General Res property/casualty business in North America also includes a few smaller specialty insurers (primarily the General Star and Genesis companies domiciled in Connecticut, North Dakota and Ohio). These specialty insurers underwrite primarily liability and workers compensation coverages on an excess and surplus basis and excess insurance for self-insured programs. In 2010, the specialty insurers represented approximately 16% of General Res North American property/casualty net written premiums.
3 Table of Contents General Res international property/casualty reinsurance business operations are conducted through internationally-based subsidiaries on a direct basis (via General Reinsurance AG as well as several other General Re subsidiaries in 26 countries) and through brokers (primarily via Faraday, which owns the managing agent of Syndicate 435 at Lloyds of London and provides capacity and participates in 100% of the results of Syndicate 435). Coverages are written on both a quota-share and excess basis for multiple lines of property, aviation and casualty reinsurance coverage. In 2010, international-based property/casualty operations principally wrote direct reinsurance in the form of treaties with lesser amounts written on a facultative basis.
Life/Health Reinsurance General Res North American and international life, health, long-term care and disability reinsurance coverages are written on an individual and group basis. Most of this business is written on a proportional treaty basis, with the exception of the U.S. group health and disability business which is predominately written on an excess treaty basis. Lesser amounts of life and disability business are written on a facultative basis. The life/health business is marketed on a direct basis. In 2010, approximately 40% of life/health net premiums were written in the United States, 26% were written in Western Europe and the remaining 34% were written throughout the rest of the world.
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (BHRG) operates from offices located in Stamford, Connecticut. Business activities are conducted through a group of subsidiary companies, led by National Indemnity Company (NICO) and Columbia Insurance Company (Columbia). BHRG provides principally excess and quota-share reinsurance to other property and casualty insurers and reinsurers. BHRGs underwriting activities also include life reinsurance and life annuity business written through Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska and financial guaranty insurance written through Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corporation.
The type and volume of insurance and reinsurance business written by BHRG is dependent on current market conditions, including prevailing premium rates and coverage terms as perceived by management, and can change rapidly. The level of BHRGs underwriting activities often fluctuates significantly from year to year depending on the perceived level of price adequacy in specific insurance and reinsurance markets.
BHRG writes catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty reinsurance contracts. BHRG also writes individual policies for primarily large or otherwise unusual discrete risks on both an excess direct and facultative reinsurance basis, referred to as individual risk, which includes policies covering terrorism, natural catastrophe and aviation risks. A catastrophe excess policy provides protection to the counterparty from the accumulation of primarily property losses arising from a single loss event or series of related events. Catastrophe and individual risk policies may provide significant amounts of indemnification per contract and a single loss event may produce losses under a number of contracts.
BHRG generally does not cede risks assumed under catastrophe excess reinsurance contracts or individual risk contracts to third parties due to, in part, perceived uncertainties in recovering amounts from other reinsurers that are financially weaker. As a result, catastrophe and individual risk business produces extremely volatile periodic underwriting results. The extraordinary financial strength of NICO and Columbia are believed to be the primary reasons why BHRG has become a major provider of such coverages.
BHRG periodically assumes risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts. Retroactive reinsurance contracts afford protection to ceding companies against the adverse development of claims arising under policies issued in prior years. Coverage under such contracts is usually provided on an excess basis and is normally subject to a large aggregate limit of indemnification. Significant amounts of environmental and latent injury claims may arise under the contracts. In certain instances, the coverages afforded under retroactive reinsurance contracts are significant. In March 2007, an agreement became effective between NICO and Equitas, a London based entity established to reinsure and manage the 1992 and prior years non-life liabilities of the Names or Underwriters at Lloyds of London. Under the agreement NICO is providing up to $7 billion of new excess reinsurance to Equitas. In 2009, NICO agreed to provide up to 5 billion Swiss Francs (approximately $5.3 billion as of December31, 2010) of aggregate excess retroactive protection to Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd. and its affiliates (Swiss Re). In 2010, BHRG entered into a reinsurance agreement with Continental Casualty Company, a subsidiary of CNA Financial Corporation (CNA), and several of CNAs other insurance subsidiaries (collectively the CNA Companies) under which BHRG assumed the asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities of the CNA Companies subject to a limit of indemnification of $4 billion.
In BHRGs retroactive reinsurance business, the concept of time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing prices and contract terms, since the payment of losses under the insurance contracts are often expected to occur over lengthy 4 Table of Contents periods of time. Losses payable under the contracts are normally expected to exceed premiums and therefore, produce underwriting losses. This business is accepted, in part, because of the large amounts of policyholder funds (float) generated for investment, the economic benefit of which will be reflected through investment income in future periods.
BHRG also underwrites traditional non-catastrophe insurance and reinsurance coverages, referred to as multi-line business. Effective January1, 2008, traditional non-catastrophe reinsurance includes a five-year 20% quota-share of property and casualty business underwritten by Swiss Re.
In 2010, BHRG entered into a new life reinsurance contract with Swiss Re Life& Health America Inc. (SRLHA). Under the agreement, BHRG assumed the liabilities and subsequent renewal premiums associated with a closed block of yearly renewable term reinsurance business reinsuring permanent and term products and universal life products written, assumed or subsequently acquired by SRLHA. BHRG assumed the mortality risk on the underlying lives with respect to the SRLHA business effective as of October1, 2009, until the underlying yearly renewable term reinsured policy non-renews or the insurer ceding the business to SRLHA recaptures the business. The agreement is expected to remain in-force for several decades and, over time, is expected to result in substantial premiums earned and life benefits incurred. At the end of 2010, BHRG also acquired the life reinsurance business of Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada. BHRGs results will include the results of this business beginning in 2011.
Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group is a collection of primary insurance operations that provide a wide variety of insurance coverages to insureds located principally in the United States. NICO and certain affiliates underwrite motor vehicle and general liability insurance to commercial enterprises on both an admitted and excess and surplus basis. This business is written nationwide primarily through insurance agents and brokers and is based in Omaha, Nebraska.
U.S. Investment Corporation (USIC), through its three subsidiaries led by United States Liability Insurance Company, is a specialty insurer that underwrites commercial, professional and personal lines of insurance on an admitted and excess and surplus basis. Policies are marketed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia through wholesale and retail insurance agents. USIC companies underwrite and market approximately 95 distinct specialty property and casualty insurance products.
Medical Protective Corporation (MedPro) is based in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Through its subsidiary, the Medical Protective Company, MedPro is a national leader in primary medical professional liability coverage and risk solutions to physicians, dentists, other healthcare providers and healthcare facilities. As one of the nations first providers of medical professional liability insurance, MedPro has provided insurance coverage to healthcare providers for over 100 years. MedPros insurance policies are distributed through a nationwide network of employee market managers and appointed agents.
In 2006, Berkshire acquired Applied Underwriters, Inc. (Applied), a leading provider of payroll and insurance services to small and medium-sized employers. Applied, through its subsidiaries, including two workers compensation insurance companies, principally markets SolutionOne  , a product that bundles a variety of related insurance coverages and business services into a seamless package that is designed to reduce the risks and remove the burden of administrative and regulatory requirements faced by small to medium-sized employers. Applied also markets EquityComp which is a workers compensationonly product targeted to medium sized employers with a profit sharing component.
In 2007, Berkshire acquired Boat America Corporation, which owns Seaworthy Insurance Company and controls the Boat Owners Association of the United States (collectively BoatU.S.). BoatU.S. provides insurance, safety and other services to recreational watercraft owners and enthusiasts.
Other insurance operations include several companies referred to as Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies, based in California, Colorado and Nebraska and with branch offices in several other states. These companies market workers compensation, commercial auto and various other commercial coverages for standard risks. Also included is Central States Indemnity Company of Omaha located in Omaha, Nebraska, which provides credit and income protection insurance and related services marketed primarily to credit and debit card holders nationwide.
Property and casualty loss reserves Berkshires property and casualty insurance companies establish reserves for estimated unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to claims occurring on or before the balance sheet date. Such estimates include provisions for reported claims or case estimates, provisions for incurred-but-not-reported (IBNR) claims and legal and administrative costs to settle 5 Table of Contents claims. The estimates of unpaid losses and amounts recoverable under reinsurance are established and continually reviewed by using a variety of actuarial, statistical and analytical techniques. Reference is made to Critical Accounting Policies, included in Item7 of this Report.
The table below presents the development of Berkshires net unpaid losses for property/casualty contracts from 2000 through 2010. Data in the table related to acquisitions is included from the acquisition date forward.
Berkshires management believes that the reserves established as of December31, 2010 are reasonable and adequate. However, due to the inherent uncertainties in the reserving process, it cannot be assured that such balances will ultimately prove to be adequate. Dollar amounts are in millions.

The cumulative foreign exchange effect represents the cumulative effect of changes in foreign exchange rates from the original balance sheet date to the end of the re-estimation period.
6 Table of Contents The first section of the table reconciles the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years from the gross liability reflected in Berkshires Consolidated Balance Sheet to the net amount, after reductions for amounts recoverable under ceded reinsurance, deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance contracts and loss reserve discounts.
Certain workers compensation loss reserves are discounted for both statutory and GAAP reporting purposes at an interest rate of 4.5%per annum for claims occurring before 2003 and at 1%per annum for claims occurring after 2002. In addition, deferred charges are recorded as assets at the inception of retroactive reinsurance contracts for the excess of the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses over the premiums received. The deferred charges are subsequently amortized over the expected claim payment period. Deferred charge amortization and loss reserve discount accretion are recorded as components of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred.
The second section of the table shows the re-estimated net unpaid losses, net of reserve discounts and deferred charges, based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The re-estimated amount reflects the effect of loss payments and re-estimation of remaining unpaid reserves. The line labeled cumulative deficiency (redundancy) represents the aggregate increase (decrease) in the initial estimates from the original balance sheet date through December31, 2010. These amounts have been reported in earnings over time as components of losses and loss adjustment expenses and include accumulated reserve discount accretion and deferred charge amortization.
The redundancies or deficiencies shown in each column should be viewed independently of the other columns because redundancies or deficiencies arising in earlier years may be included as components of redundancies or deficiencies in the more recent years. Liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts are treated as occurrences in the year the contract was entered into, as opposed to when the underlying losses actually occurred, which is prior to the contract date. Due to the significance of the deferred charges and reserve discounts, the cumulative changes in such balances which are included in the cumulative deficiency/redundancy amounts are also provided.
The third part of the table shows the cumulative amount of net losses and loss adjustment expenses paid with respect to recorded net liabilities as of the end of each succeeding year. While the information in the table provides a historical perspective on the adequacy of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses established in previous years, and the subsequent payments of claims, readers are cautioned against extrapolating redundancies or deficiencies of the past on current unpaid loss balances.
Investments Invested assets of insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital as well as funds provided from policyholders through insurance and reinsurance business (float). Float is an approximation of the amount of net policyholder funds available for investment. That term denotes the sum of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, unearned premiums and other policyholder liabilities, less the aggregate amount of premium balances receivable, losses recoverable from reinsurance ceded, deferred policy acquisition costs, deferred charges on reinsurance contracts and related deferred income taxes.
The amount of float has grown from approximately $49 billion at the end of 2005 to approximately $66 billion at the end of 2010, primarily through internal growth. BHRG and General Re accounted for approximately 75% of total float as of December31, 2010. Equally important as the amount of the float is its cost, represented by Berkshires periodic net underwriting gain or loss. The increases in the amount of float plus the substantial amounts of shareholder capital devoted to insurance and reinsurance activities have generated meaningful increases in the levels of investments and investment income over the past five years.
Investment portfolios of insurance subsidiaries include ownership of equity securities of other publicly traded companies which are concentrated in relatively few companies and large amounts of fixed maturity securities and cash and cash equivalents. Fixed maturity investments consist of obligations of the U.S. Government, U.S. states and municipalities, mortgage-backed securities issued primarily by the three major U.S. Government and Government-sponsored agencies, as well as obligations of foreign governments and corporate obligations. Investment portfolios are primarily managed by Berkshires corporate office. Generally, there are no targeted investment allocation rates established by management with respect to investment activities. Rather, management may increase or decrease investments in response to perceived changes in opportunities for income or price appreciation relative to risks associated with the issuers of the securities.
Railroad Business On February12, 2010, Berkshire completed its acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation. The acquisition was completed through the merger of a wholly-owned merger subsidiary and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation. The 7 Table of Contents merger subsidiary was the surviving entity and was renamed Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (BNSF). BNSF is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and through BNSF Railway Company operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America. BNSF has approximately 38,000 employees as of December31, 2010.
In serving the Midwest, Pacific Northwest, Western, Southwestern and Southeastern regions and ports of the country, BNSF transports a range of products and commodities derived from manufacturing, agricultural and natural resource industries. Over half of the freight revenues of BNSF are covered by contractual agreements of varying durations, while the balance is subject to common carrier, published prices or quotations offered by BNSF. BNSFs financial performance is influenced by, among other things, general and industry economic conditions at the international, national and regional levels. BNSFs primary routes, including trackage rights, allow it to access major cities and ports in the western and southern United States as well as Canadian and Mexican traffic. In addition to major cities and ports, BNSF efficiently serves many smaller markets by working closely with approximately 200 shortline partners. BNSF has also entered into marketing agreements with other rail carriers, expanding the marketing reach for each railroad and their customers. For the year ending December31, 2010, 31% of freight revenues were derived from consumer products, 21% from industrial products, 27% from coal and 21% from agricultural products.
Regulatory Matters BNSF is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to all of its businesses. Rail operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (STB) of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), the Federal Railroad Administration of the DOT, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), as well as other federal and state regulatory agencies and Canadian regulatory agencies for operations in Canada. The STB has jurisdiction over disputes and complaints involving certain rates, routes and services, the sale or abandonment of rail lines, applications for line extensions and construction and consolidation or merger with, or acquisition of control of, rail common carriers. The outcome of STB proceedings can affect the profitability of BNSFs business.
The DOT and OSHA have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials. State agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law.
Environmental Matters BNSFs rail operations, as well as those of its competitors, are also subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental regulation covering discharges to water, air emissions, toxic substances and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. This regulation has the effect of increasing the cost and liabilities associated with rail operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials.
Many of BNSFs land holdings are and have been used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. As a result, BNSF is now subject to, and will from time to time continue to be subject to, environmental cleanup and enforcement actions. In particular, the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as the Superfund law, generally imposes joint and several liability for the cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. Accordingly, BNSF may be responsible under CERCLA and other federal and state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which certain substances may have been released by BNSF, its current lessees, former owners or lessees of properties, or other third parties. BNSF may also be subject to claims by third parties for investigation, cleanup, restoration or other environmental costs under environmental statutes or common law with respect to properties they own that have been impacted by BNSF operations.
Competition The business environment in which BNSF operates is highly competitive. Depending on the specific market, deregulated motor carriers and other railroads, as well as river barges, ships and pipelines in certain markets, may exert pressure on price and service levels. The presence of advanced, high service truck lines with expedited delivery, subsidized infrastructure and minimal empty mileage continues to affect the market for non-bulk, time-sensitive freight. The potential expansion of longer combination vehicles could further encroach upon markets traditionally served by railroads. In order to remain competitive, BNSF and other railroads continue to develop and implement operating efficiencies to improve productivity.
8 Table of Contents As railroads streamline, rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises, competition among rail carriers intensifies. BNSFs primary rail competitor in the Western region of the United States is the Union Pacific Railroad Company. Other Class I railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the same territories served by BNSF. Based on weekly reporting by the Association of American Railroads, BNSFs share of the western United States rail traffic in 2010 was approximately 48 percent.
Utilities and Energy Businesses Berkshire currently owns an 89.8% voting common stock interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (MidAmerican), an international energy company. Following the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and approval by the appropriate federal and state regulatory authorities, on February9, 2006, Berkshire converted its non-voting convertible preferred stock investment in MidAmerican to voting common stock. Prior to the conversion, Berkshire owned a 9.7% voting interest and an 83.4% economic interest in MidAmerican.
MidAmericans businesses are managed as separate operating units. MidAmericans domestic regulated energy interests are comprised of two regulated utility companies serving more than 3million retail customers and two interstate natural gas pipeline companies with approximately 17,000 miles of pipeline and a design capacity of approximately 7.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day.

General Matters PacifiCorp is a regulated electric utility company headquartered in Oregon, serving regulated retail electric customers in portions of Utah, Oregon, Wyoming, Washington, Idaho and California. The combined service territorys diverse regional economy ranges from rural, agricultural and mining areas to urban, manufacturing and government service centers. No single segment of the economy dominates the service territory, which helps mitigate PacifiCorps exposure to economic fluctuations. In addition to retail sales, PacifiCorp sells electricity to other utilities, municipalities and energy marketing companies on a wholesale basis.
As a vertically integrated electric utility, PacifiCorp owns approximately 10,600 net megawatts (MW) of generation capacity. There are seasonal variations in PacifiCorps business. Peak customer demand is typically highest in the summer across PacifiCorps service territory when air conditioning and irrigation systems are heavily used. The service territory also has a winter peak, which is primarily due to heating requirements in the western portion of PacifiCorps service territory.
MidAmerican Energy Company (MEC) is a regulated electric and natural gas utility company headquartered in Iowa, serving regulated retail electric and natural gas customers primarily in Iowa and also in portions of Illinois, South Dakota and Nebraska. MEC has a diverse customer base consisting of residential, agricultural and a variety of commercial and industrial customer groups. In addition to retail sales and natural gas transportation, MEC sells regulated electricity to markets operated by regional transmission organizations and regulated electricity and natural gas to other utilities, municipalities and energy marketing companies on a wholesale basis and sells non-regulated electricity and natural gas services in deregulated markets.
As a vertically integrated electric and gas utility, MEC owns approximately 6,500 net MW of generation capacity. There are seasonal variations in MECs business that are principally related to the use of electricity for air conditioning and natural gas for heating. Typically, 35-40% of MECs regulated electric revenues are reported in the summer months, while 45-55% of MECs regulated natural gas revenues are reported in the winter months.
Northern Natural Gas Company (Northern Natural) is based in Nebraska and owns one of the largest interstate natural gas pipeline systems in the United States reaching from southern Texas to Michigans Upper Peninsula. Northern Naturals pipeline system consists of approximately 15,000 miles of natural gas pipelines. Northern Natural has access to supplies from every major mid-continent basin and provides transportation services to utilities and numerous other customers. Northern Natural also operates three underground natural gas storage facilities and two liquefied natural gas storage peaking units. Northern Naturals pipeline system experiences significant seasonal swings in demand and revenue, with the highest demand typically occurring during the months of November through March.
Kern River Gas Transmission Company (Kern River) is based in Utah and owns an interstate natural gas pipeline system that extends from the supply areas in the Rocky Mountains to consuming markets in Utah, Nevada and California. Kern River 9 Table of Contents transports natural gas for major oil and natural gas companies or affiliates of such companies, electricity generating companies, energy marketing and trading companies, financial institutions and natural gas distribution utilities. Kern Rivers pipeline system consists of approximately 1,700 miles of natural gas pipelines and its scheduled throughput regularly exceeds its design capacity.
MidAmerican, through Northern Electric Distribution Limited (Northern Electric) and Yorkshire Electricity Distribution plc (Yorkshire Electricity), owns a substantial United Kingdom electricity distribution network that delivers electricity to end-users in northeast England in an area covering approximately 10,000 square miles. The distribution companies primarily charge supply companies regulated tariffs for the use of electrical infrastructure.
Regulatory Matters PacifiCorp and MEC are subject to comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is an independent agency with broad authority to implement provisions of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act (NGA), the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other federal statutes. The FERC regulates rates for wholesale sales of electricity; transmission of electricity, including pricing and regional planning for the expansion of transmission systems; electric system reliability; utility holding companies; accounting; securities issuances; and other matters, including construction and operation of hydroelectric facilities. The FERC also has the enforcement authority to assess civil penalties of up to $1million per day per violation of rules, regulations and orders issued under the Federal Power Act. MEC is also subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to its ownership of the Quad Cities Nuclear Station.
Except for Oregon, Washington and Illinois, both PacifiCorp and MEC have an exclusive right to serve retail customers within their service territories and, in turn, have an obligation to provide service to those customers. Historically, state regulatory commissions have established retail electric and natural gas rates on a cost-of-service basis, which are designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its costs of providing services and to earn a reasonable return on its investments. The retail electric rates of PacifiCorp and MEC are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled services, including generation, transmission and distribution services.
Northern Natural and Kern River are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The natural gas pipeline and storage operations of Northern Natural and Kern River are regulated by the FERC, which administers, most significantly, the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Under this authority, the FERC regulates, among other items, (a)rates, charges, terms and conditions of service and (b)the construction and operation of interstate pipelines, storage and related facilities, including the extension, expansion or abandonment of such facilities. Interstate pipeline companies are also subject to regulation by a federal agency within the United States Department of Transportation, pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, which establishes safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas facilities, and the Federal Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, which implemented additional safety and pipeline integrity regulations for high consequence areas.
Northern Electric and Yorkshire Electricity each charge fees for the use of their distribution systems that are controlled by a formula prescribed by the British electricity regulatory body, the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority. The distribution price control formula is generally reviewed and reset at five-year intervals. The current price control period commenced April1, 2010.
Environmental Matters MidAmerican and its energy businesses are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding air and water quality, renewable portfolio standards, emissions performance standards, climate change, coal combustion byproducts, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact MidAmericans current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations, such as the Federal Clean Air Act, provide authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions.
The Federal Clean Air Act, as well as state laws and regulations impacting air emissions, provides a framework for protecting and improving the nations air quality and controlling sources of air emissions. These laws and regulations continue to evolve and will likely impact the operation of MidAmericans generating facilities and require them to reduce emissions at those facilities through the installation of additional emission control equipment or to purchase additional emission allowances.
10 Table of Contents Renewable portfolio standards have been established by certain state governments and generally require electricity providers to obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewable energy resources by a certain date. Utah, Oregon, Washington, California and Iowa have adopted renewable portfolio standards.
The increased global attention to climate change has resulted in significant measures being proposed at the federal level to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The United States Congress has considered, but has not adopted, comprehensive climate change legislation, which included a market-based cap-and-trade program that was intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 83% below 2005 levels by 2050. In addition, governmental, nongovernmental and environmental organizations have become more active in pursuing climate change related litigation under existing laws. In 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency published findings that greenhouse gas emissions threaten the public health and welfare and is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the Federal Clean Air Act. While the debate continues at the federal and international level over the direction of climate change policy, several states have developed or are developing state-specific laws or regional initiatives to report or mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.
The impact of pending federal, regional, state and international accords, legislation, regulation or judicial proceedings related to climate change cannot be quantified in any meaningful range at this time. New requirements limiting greenhouse gas emissions could have a material adverse impact on MidAmerican, the United States and the global economy.
MidAmerican continues to take actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. For example, as of December31, 2010, MidAmerican owns 2,316 megawatts of wind-powered generating capacity at a total cost of $4.4 billion. MEC has begun construction of an additional 593 megawatts of wind-powered generating facilities to be placed in service in 2011.
Non-Energy Businesses MidAmerican also owns HomeServices of America, Inc. (HomeServices), the second largest full-service residential real estate brokerage firm in the United States. HomeServices also offers integrated real estate services, including mortgage originations through a joint venture, title and closing services, property and casualty insurance, home warranties, relocation services and other home-related services. It operates under 22 residential real estate brand names with over 15,000 sales associates and nearly 300 broker offices in 20 states. HomeServices principal sources of revenue are dependent on residential real estate sales, which are generally higher in the second and third quarters of each year. This business is highly competitive and subject to the general real estate market conditions.

FOLs bras, athletic equipment, footwear, sporting goods and other athletic apparel lines are generally sourced from third-party contractors located primarily in Asia.
Cotton and polyester fibers are the main raw materials used in the manufacturing of FOLs products and are purchased from a limited number of third-party suppliers and manufacturers. Management currently believes there are readily available alternative sources of raw materials. However, if relationships with suppliers cannot be maintained or delays occur in obtaining alternative sources of supply, production could be adversely affected, which could have a corresponding adverse effect on results of operations. Additionally, raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, government regulations, economic climate and other unpredictable factors. FOL has secured contracts to purchase cotton to meet production plans for 2011. In 2010, cotton market prices increased by 80% due to lower worldwide crop yield, export restrictions in India and increasing global demand. These conditions resulted in increased raw material prices across the apparel industry. FOLs markets are highly competitive, consisting of many domestic and foreign manufacturers and distributors.

18 Table of Contents Item1A.
Risk Factors Berkshire and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as we, us, our or similar expressions) are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in our business operations which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations.
Our tolerance for risk in our insurance businesses may result in significant underwriting losses.
We have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from a single event than any other insurer has knowingly assumed. We could incur a significant loss from a single event and do so willingly if properly paid for the risk assumed. We have also written some coverages for losses arising from acts of terrorism. In all cases, however, we attempt to avoid writing groups of policies from which losses might seriously aggregate. However, it is possible that despite our efforts, losses may aggregate in ways that were not anticipated. The tolerance for huge losses may result in such losses in future periods, which may result in lower reported earnings.
The degree of estimation error inherent in the process of estimating property and casualty insurance loss reserves may result in significant underwriting losses.
In the insurance business, premiums are charged today for promises to pay covered losses in the future. The principal cost associated with premium revenue is claims. However, it will take decades before all losses that have occurred as of the balance sheet date will be reported and settled. Although we believe that loss reserve balances are adequate to cover losses, we will not truly know whether the premiums charged for the coverages provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date. Except for certain product lines, our objective is to generate underwriting profits over the long-term. Estimating insurance claim costs is inherently imprecise. Our estimated insurance loss reserves are large ($60 billion at December31, 2010) so increases to reserve estimates can result in materially lower periodic reported earnings.
Insurance subsidiaries investments are unusually concentrated and fair values are subject to loss in value.
Compared to other insurers, our insurance subsidiaries invest an unusually high percentage of their assets in common stocks and diversify their portfolios far less than is conventional. A significant decline in the general stock market or in the price of major investments may produce a large decrease in our consolidated shareholders equity and under certain circumstances may require the recognition of losses in the statement of earnings. Decreases in values of equity investments can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated book value per share.
Derivative contracts may require significant future cash settlement payments and result in significant losses.
We have assumed the risk of potentially significant losses under our credit default and equity index put option contracts. Although we received considerable premiums as compensation for accepting these risks, there is no assurance that the premiums we received will exceed our aggregate cash settlement payments. While the risks under the credit default contracts are limited to specified entities, amounts per entity and aggregate contract limits, the deterioration of the U.S. economy or in the financial condition of the referenced entities, could result in significant losses. Although no loss events occurred in 2010 and our remaining exposures decreased, the risks of additional payments and losses in our earnings from credit defaults continues into the future. Our risks of losses under equity index put option contracts are based on declines in equity prices of stocks comprising certain major stock indexes worldwide. Although the contracts currently in-force do not begin to expire until 2018, we could be subject to significant future settlement payments at expiration if equity index prices are below the strike prices specified in the contracts.
The credit default and equity index put option contracts are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and the periodic changes in fair value are reported in earnings. The valuations of these contracts and the impact on our earnings can be particularly significant reflecting the volatility of credit and equity markets and material losses may be reported in future periodic earnings.
We are dependent on a few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decisions.
Major investment decisions and all major capital allocation decisions are made by Warren E. Buffett, Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO, age 80, in consultation with Charles T. Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, age 87. If for any reason the services of our key personnel, particularly Mr.Buffett, were to become unavailable, there could be a 19 Table of Contents material adverse effect on our operations. However, Berkshires Board of Directors has identified four current Berkshire subsidiary managers who are capable of being CEO. Berkshires Board has agreed on a replacement for Mr.Buffett should a replacement be needed currently. The Board continually monitors this risk and could alter its current view regarding a replacement for Mr.Buffett in the future. We believe that the Boards succession plan, together with the outstanding managers running our numerous and highly diversified operating units helps to mitigate this risk.
The past growth rate in Berkshires book value per share is not an indication of future results.
In the years since our present management acquired control of Berkshire, our book value per share has grown at a highly satisfactory rate. Because of the large size of our capital base (shareholders equity of approximately $157.3 billion as of December31, 2010), our book value per share will very likely not increase in the future at a rate even close to its past rate.
Competition Each of our operating businesses face intense competitive pressures within markets in which they operate. Competition may arise domestically as well as internationally. While we manage our businesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantages, many factors, including market and technology changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantages. Accordingly, future operating results will depend to some degree on whether our operating units are successful in protecting or enhancing their competitive advantages. If our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating results in the future may decline from current levels.
Unfavorable economic and political conditions could hurt our operating businesses.
Our operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles affecting the economy in general or the industries in which we operate. To the extent that the recovery from the recent economic recession in the U.S. and worldwide is slow or the economy worsens for a prolonged period of time, one or more of our significant operations could be materially harmed. In addition, our utilities and energy businesses, our railroad business and our manufactured housing finance operations regularly utilize debt as a component of their capital structures. These businesses depend on having access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates. To the extent that access to the credit is restricted or the cost of funding increases, our operations could be adversely affected.
Historically, we derived a relatively small amount of our revenues and earnings from international markets. Our international business was conducted primarily in regions where relatively stable political and economic conditions have prevailed. As a result of our business acquisitions, we are subject to increased risks from unstable political conditions and civil unrest at certain of our internationally based businesses. Further, terrorism activities deriving from unstable conditions could produce significant insurance and other operating losses to our worldwide operations, including operations based in the United States. Our business operations could be adversely affected directly through the loss of human resources and destruction of production facilities.
Risks unique to our regulated businesses Insurance Businesses Our insurance businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulations may relate to among other things, the types of business we can write, the rates we can charge for coverage, the level of capital that we must maintain, and restrictions on the types and size of investments we can make. Regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments. Accordingly, changes in regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance companies, may adversely impact our results of operations.
Railroad Business Our railroad business is subject to a significant amount of governmental laws and regulations with respect to rates and practices, railroad operations and a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental and other matters. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on BNSFs business. Governments may change the legislative and/or regulatory framework within which BNSF operates without providing any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on the business. Increased economic regulation of the rail industry could negatively impact BNSFs ability to determine prices for rail services and to make capital improvements to its rail network, resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
20 Table of Contents Utilities and Energy Businesses For the most part, our utilities and energy businesses, which generate, transmit and distribute electricity and transport, store and distribute natural gas, are highly regulated by numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions in which they operate. These regulations are complex, dynamic and may be subject to new interpretations or change. Regulations affect almost every aspect of our utilities and energy businesses, have broad application and limit our ability to independently make and implement management decisions regarding numerous matters, including business combinations; constructing, acquiring or disposing of operating assets; operation of generating facilities and transmission and distribution assets; setting rates charged to customers; establishing capital structures and issuing debt or equity securities; transactions between our domestic utilities and other subsidiaries and affiliates; and paying dividends to shareholders. Adverse new legislation, regulation, reinterpretations of existing regulation, such as those relating to air and water quality, renewable portfolio standards, emissions performance standards, climate change, coal combustion byproducts, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters, or the nature of the regulatory process may have a significant adverse impact on our financial results.
Our utilities and energy business requires significant amounts of capital to construct, operate and maintain sufficient generation, transmission and distribution systems. Usually, large amounts of borrowed funds are required to capitalize these businesses and additional borrowed funds may not be available at economically favorable terms. Additionally, such systems may need to be operational for very long periods of time in order to justify the financial investment. The risk of operational or financial failure of capital projects is not necessarily recoverable through rates that are charged to customers.
Our Class B common stock is not convertible and has a lower vote and stock price than our ClassA common stock.
Each share of ClassA common stock is currently convertible into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock, but shares of Class B common stock are not convertible into shares of ClassA common stock or any other security. Although a share of Class B common stock may sell below one-fifteen-hundredth of the market price for a share of ClassA common stock, it is unlikely that a share of Class B common stock will sell significantly above 1/1,500 of the market price for a share of ClassA common stock because higher prices than that would cause arbitrage activity to ensue. Also, holders of ClassA common stock are entitled to one vote, but holders of Class B common stock are currently entitled to only 1/10,000 of a vote for each Class B share on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders.
Regulatory changes may adversely impact our future operating results.
Over the past year, partially in response to the financial markets crises and the global economic recession, regulatory initiatives have accelerated in the United States and abroad. Such initiatives address for example, the regulation of banks and other major financial institutions, regulations related to environmental and global-warming matters and health care reform. It is not yet clear whether or not these initiatives will result in significant changes to existing laws and regulations. These initiatives could have a significant impact on our operating businesses as well as on the businesses that we have a significant but not controlling economic interest. Accordingly we cannot predict whether such initiatives will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Item3.
Legal Proceedings We are parties in a variety of legal actions arising out of the normal course of business. In particular, such legal actions affect our insurance and reinsurance businesses. Such litigation generally seeks to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or 24 Table of Contents exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties in substantial amounts.
a) Civil Litigation Litigation Related to ROA General Reinsurance Corporation (General Reinsurance), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire, and several current and former employees, along with numerous other defendants, have been sued in fourteen federal lawsuits involving Reciprocal of America (ROA) and related entities. ROA was a Virginia-based reciprocal insurer and reinsurer of physician, hospital and lawyer professional liability risks. Ten are putative class actions initiated by doctors, hospitals and lawyers that purchased insurance through ROA or certain of its Tennessee-based risk retention groups. These complaints seek compensatory, treble, and punitive damages in an amount plaintiffs contend is just and reasonable. The most recently filed action was filed in April 2010 by the same attorneys representing the same hospitals as in three of the other putative class actions pending in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee. The allegations are virtually identical to the previously filed hospital policyholder actions.
General Reinsurance is also subject to actions brought by the Virginia Commissioner of Insurance, as Deputy Receiver of ROA, the Tennessee Commissioner of Insurance, as Receiver for purposes of liquidating three Tennessee risk retention groups, a state lawsuit filed by a Missouri-based hospital group that was removed to federal court and another state lawsuit filed by an Alabama doctor that was also removed to federal court. The first of these actions was filed in March 2003 and additional actions were filed in April 2003 through June 2006. Twelve of these cases are collectively assigned to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee for pretrial proceedings.
General Reinsurance has settled with both the Virginia and Tennessee Receivers, whose respective claims against General Reinsurance and its current and former employees have been dismissed with prejudice. The Missouri-based hospital group has also agreed to dismiss its claims against General Reinsurance.
Actions related to AIG General Reinsurance is a defendant in In re American International Group Securities Litigation, Case No.04-CV-8141-(LTS), United States District Court, Southern District of New York, a putative class action (the AIG Securities Litigation) asserted on behalf of investors who purchased publicly-traded securities of AIG between October 1999 and March 2005. The complaint, originally filed in April 2005, asserts various claims against AIG and certain of its officers, directors, investment banks and other parties, including former employees of General Reinsurance (whom the Complaint defines, together with General Reinsurance, as the General Re Defendants). The Complaint alleges that the General Re Defendants violated Section10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 in connection with General Reinsurances transaction with AIG initially effected in 2000 (the AIG Transaction). The Complaint seeks damages and other relief in unspecified amounts. General Reinsurance has answered the Complaint, denying liability and asserting various affirmative defenses. Lead plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on February20, 2008. Various defendants, including General Reinsurance, have filed oppositions to class certification. The lead plaintiffs and General Reinsurance previously reached agreement concerning the terms of a settlement that would resolve all claims against the General Re Defendants in exchange for a payment by General Reinsurance of $72 million, out of which the court may award plaintiffs counsel no more than $11.5 million in fees and reimbursement of costs, with the remaining amount of at least $60.5 million to be distributed to purchasers of AIG securities. There was no court decision specifically approving or disapproving this settlement but rather, on February22, 2010, the court granted class certification with respect to claims against AIG, and denied class certification with respect to claims against General Reinsurance. On September23, 2010, the court entered a final judgment dismissing the General Re Defendants from the case. On October21, 2010, the lead plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and the putative class, filed a notice of appeal of that final judgment, and also appealed from the courts February22, 2010 order (granting in part and denying in part the lead plaintiffs motion to certify the class, but only to the extent the order denied class certification as against the General Re Defendants), and the courts March4, 2010 order denying as moot the lead plaintiffs motion for preliminary court approval of the class action settlement with General Re.
A member of the putative class in the litigation described in the preceding paragraph has asserted similar claims against General Reinsurance and a former officer of General Reinsurance in a separate complaint, Florida State Board of Administration v. General Re Corporation, et al., Case No.06-CV-3967, United States District Court, Southern District of New York. The parties have settled this matter, the terms of which will require dismissal of this action with prejudice.
25 Table of Contents On July27, 2005, General Reinsurance received a Summons and a Verified and Amended Shareholder Derivative Complaint in In re American International Group, Inc. Derivative Litigation, Case No.04-CV-08406, United States District Court, Southern District of New York. The complaint, brought by several alleged shareholders of AIG, seeks damages, injunctive and declaratory relief against various officers and directors of AIG as well as a variety of individuals and entities with whom AIG did business, relating to a wide variety of allegedly wrongful practices by AIG. Plaintiffs have petitioned the court to dismiss the action with prejudice as to all defendants.
In August 2005, General Reinsurance received a Summons and First Amended Consolidated Shareholders Derivative Complaint in In re American International Group, Inc. Consolidated Derivative Litigation, Case No.769-N, Delaware Chancery Court. On September28, 2007, AIG and the shareholder plaintiffs filed a Second Combined Amended Complaint, in which AIG asserted claims against certain of its former officers and the shareholder plaintiffs asserted claims against a number of other defendants, including General Reinsurance. On July13, 2009, the Delaware Chancery Court entered judgment dismissing with prejudice the claims asserted against General Reinsurance and certain other defendants in the matter. By Order dated December29, 2010, the Delaware Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the Chancery Court dismissal of the claims against General Reinsurance and certain other defendants.
FAI/HIH Matter In December 2003, the Liquidators of both FAI Insurance Limited (FAI) and HIH Insurance Limited (HIH) advised indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Berkshire (General Reinsurance Australia Limited (GRA) and Klnische Rckversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG (Cologne Re)) that they intended to assert claims arising from insurance transactions GRA entered into with FAI in May and June 1998. In August 2004, the Liquidators filed claims in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in order to avoid the expiration of a statute of limitations for certain plaintiffs. The focus of the Liquidators allegations against GRA and Cologne Re are the 1998 transactions GRA entered into with FAI (which was acquired by HIH in 1999). The Liquidators contend, among other things, that GRA and Cologne Re engaged in deceptive conduct that assisted FAI in improperly accounting for such transactions as reinsurance, and that such deception led to HIHs acquisition of FAI and caused various losses to FAI and HIH. The Liquidator of HIH served its Complaint on GRA and Cologne Re in June 2006 and discovery has been ongoing. The FAI Liquidator previously dismissed his complaint against GRA and Cologne Re. GRA and Cologne Re have finalized their settlement with the HIH Liquidator and as a result on March24, 2010 court orders were entered dismissing the HIH Liquidators action in its entirety.
We have established reserves for certain of the legal proceedings discussed above where we have concluded that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of current pending civil litigation, including the matters discussed above, will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Our operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our corporate senior management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion.
On February12, 2010, we completed the acquisition of the 77.5% of BNSF common stock that we did not already own. Beginning as of February13, 2010, BNSFs results and net earnings are included fully in our consolidated results and net earnings. In 2009 and until February12, 2010, our share of net earnings related to our previously held investments in BNSF, as determined under the equity method, is included as a component of insurance investment income in the preceding table.
Over the last half of 2008 and throughout 2009, operating results of many of our businesses were adversely impacted by the world-wide economic recession. While our two largest business segments, which in 2009 were insurance and utilities, remained strong and operating results were not negatively impacted in any significant way by the recession, earnings of mostof our diverse group of manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined during 2009 as compared to the preceding two years. The effects from the economic recession resulted in lower sales volume and profit margins as consumers significantly curtailed spending, particularly for discretionary items. In 2010, operating results for many of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses improved versus 2009, reflecting some stabilization of economic conditions.
In 2010, we realized after-tax investment and derivative gains of approximately $1.9billion. The gains included a one-time holding gain of $979million related to our acquisition of BNSF, net realized gains from the dispositions of investments, and net gains from derivative contracts, partially offset by non-cash other-than-temporary impairment losses recorded with respect to certain fixed maturity and equity securities. In 2009, we realized after-tax investment and derivative gains of $486million, while in 2008 we had losses of approximately $4.6billion. In 2009 and 2008, the gains and losses primarily derived from credit default contracts, dispositions of equity securities, other-than-temporary impairment losses with respect to certain equity securities and changes in estimated fair values of long duration equity index put option contracts. Changes in the equity and credit markets from period to period can and have caused significant volatility in periodic earnings.
In response to the crises in the financial markets and the global recession, the U.S. government and governments around the world are taking measures to regulate financial institutions, stabilize financial markets (including over-the-counter derivatives markets) and stimulate economic activity. In the United States, regulatory reform legislation known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law on July21, 2010. The ultimate impact that these governmental actions will have on us is not entirely certain at this time. Our operating companies have taken and will continue to take actions as necessary to manage through the current economic situation and to improve our operations for the long-term. We continue to believe that the economic franchises of our operating businesses remain intact. We anticipate that general economic conditions will continue to gradually improve, albeit unevenly, over time.
29 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) InsuranceUnderwriting We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are: (1)GEICO, (2)General Re, (3)Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (BHRG) and (4)Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Through General Re and BHRG, we also reinsure life and health risks.
We view insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations  underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing, with limited exceptions, is the responsibility of Berkshires Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income.
Our periodic underwriting results can be affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years. In addition, the timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results. Our underwriting results also include significant unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the periodic revaluation of certain non-U.S.Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities into U.S. Dollars as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
A key marketing strategy followed by all of our insurance businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. Statutory surplus of our insurance businesses was approximately $94billion at December31, 2010. This superior capital strength creates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet the unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers.
Underwriting results from our insurance businesses are summarized below. Amounts are inmillions.

GEICOs policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. This is a significant element in our strategy to be a low-cost auto insurer. In addition, we strive to provide excellent service to customers, with the goal of establishing long-term customer relationships. GEICOs underwriting results are summarized below.

The growth in premiums earned for voluntary auto was 5.3% in 2010, reflecting a 5.9% increase in policies-in-force over the past year. Premiums earned in 2010 also reflected a very slight increase in average premiums per policy over the year, although by the end of 2010 average premiums per policy declined to year-end 2009 levels. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2010 declined 2.6% from relatively high levels during 2009 when new business sales increased 9.0% versus 2008. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December31, 2010 were approximately 563,000 greater than at December31, 2009. The strong growth that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2010 when voluntary auto policies-in-force grew by about 165,000 is continuing. As of February 21, 2011, voluntary auto policies-in-force grew by about 188,500 since year-end.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2010 increased 1.7% over amounts incurred in 2009. The loss ratio was 74.4% in 2010 compared to 77.0% in 2009. The lower loss ratio in 2010 reflected the favorable impact of increased premium volume which was partially offset by changes in claim frequencies and severities. Claims frequencies in 2010 for property damage and collision coverages increased in the one to two percent range versus 2009, while frequencies for comprehensive coverages rose in the five to seven percent range from 2009 due to higher numbers of glass claims. Injury claims frequencies increased in the two to four percent range versus 2009. Claim severities in 2010 for physical damage coverages rose in the two to four percent range compared to 2009, while injury severities increased in the three to seven percent range. Incurred losses from catastrophe events in 2010 were $109million compared to $83million in 2009. Underwriting expenses incurred in 2010 increased 2.6% versus 2009 and primarily reflected increased advertising.
Premiums earned in 2009 increased $1,097million (8.8%)over 2008, reflecting growth in voluntary auto premiums earned as a result of an overall increase in policies-in-force of 7.8%. Policies-in-force grew more rapidly in the latter part of 2008 and the early part of 2009 and moderated over the remainder of 2009. As a result, premiums earned in 2009 increased at a higher rate than policies-in-force, despite a slight decline in premiums per policy. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December31, 2009 were 684,000 greater than at December31, 2008.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2009 increased $1,125million (12.1%)compared with 2008. The loss ratio was 77.0% in 2009 compared to 74.8% in 2008. The higher loss ratio in 2009 reflected overall increases in claim frequencies and injury claim severities. Claims frequencies in 2009 for physical damage coverages increased in the one to two percent range, while frequencies for injury coverages increased in the five to seven percent range compared with the very low frequency levels in 2008. Injury severities in 2009 increased in the three to five percent range while physical damage severities decreased in the two to four percent range from 2008. Incurred losses from catastrophe events in 2009 of $83million were relatively unchanged from 2008. Underwriting expenses in 2009 increased $239million (10.7%)due primarily to higher policy issuance costs and increased salary and employee benefit expenses, which included increased interest on deferred compensation liabilities.
General Re Through General Re, we conduct a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients worldwide. We write property and casualty reinsurance in North America on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation and internationally through Germany-based General Reinsurance AG (formerly named Cologne Re) and other wholly-owned affiliates. Property and casualty reinsurance is also written through brokers with respect to Faraday in London. Life and health reinsurance is written in North America through General Re Life Corporation and internationally through General Reinsurance AG. General Re strives to generate underwriting profits in essentially all of its product lines, without consideration of investment income. Our management does not evaluate underwriting performance based upon market share and our underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. General Res underwriting results are summarized in the following table. Amounts are inmillions.

Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums written and earned in 2010 declined $202million (6.5%)and $169million (5.3%), respectively, compared with 2009. Premiums written and earned in 2010 reflected decreased volume as price competition in most property and casualty lines has led to decreases in premium volume over the past several years. Our underwriters continue to maintain discipline by rejecting inadequately priced offerings. Increased price competition and capacity within the industry could continue to constrain premium volume during 2011.
Underwriting gains were $289million in 2010 and consisted of gains of $236million from property business and $53million from casualty/workers compensation business. The property business produced underwriting losses of $96million for the 2010 accident year, offset by gains of $332million from loss reserve reductions related to loss events occurring before 2010. The property results in 2010 were net of $339million of catastrophe losses incurred primarily from the Chilean and New Zealand earthquakes and weather-related losses in Europe, Australia and New England. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe and large individual losses produces significant volatility in periodic underwriting results. The underwriting gains of $53million from casualty/workers compensation business reflected overall reductions in prior years loss reserve estimates offset in part by $125million of workers compensation loss reserve discount accretion and deferred charge amortization.
Premiums written and earned in 2009 declined $292million (8.6%)and $231million (6.7%), respectively, from 2008. Premiums in 2008 included $205million with respect to a reinsurance-to-close transaction that increased our economic interest in the run-off of Lloyds Syndicate 435s 2000 year of account from 39% to 100%. Under the reinsurance-to-close transaction, we also assumed a corresponding amount of net loss reserves and as a result, there was no impact on net underwriting gains in 2008. There was no similar transaction in 2009. Excluding the reinsurance-to-close transaction and the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums written and earned in 2009 increased $149million (4.7%)and $107million (3.3%), respectively, compared to 2008, primarily due to increased volume in European treaty and Lloyds market property business.
Underwriting results in 2009 included underwriting gains of $478million from property business and losses of $178million from casualty/workers compensation business. The property business produced underwriting gains of $173million for the 2009 accident year, and $305million from loss reserve reductions related to loss events occurring before 2009. The property gains in 2009 were net of $48million of losses from catastrophes, which were primarily from winter storm Klaus in Europe, the Victoria bushfires in Australia and an earthquake in Italy. The underwriting losses from casualty/workers compensation business were primarily the result of establishing higher loss reserves for 2009 accident year occurrences to reflect higher loss trends as well as $118million of workers compensation loss reserve discount accretion and deferred charge amortization, offset in part by reserve reductions related to prior years casualty/workers compensation loss reserves.
Underwriting results in 2008 included $275million in underwriting gains from property business partially offset by $112million in underwriting losses from casualty/workers compensation business. The property business produced underwriting losses of $120million for the 2008 accident year, offset by $395million of gains from loss reserve reductions related to loss events occurring before 2008. The 2008 accident year results included $174million of catastrophe losses from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike and $56million of catastrophe losses from European storms. The underwriting losses from casualty/workers compensation business in 2008 included $117million of workers compensation loss reserve discount accretion and deferred charge amortization, offset in part by reserve reductions related to prior years other casualty lines. The casualty results were also adversely impacted by legal costs incurred in connection with regulatory investigations.
Life/health Premiums earned in 2010 increased 3.4% over 2009, which increased 1.8% over 2008. Adjusting for the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums earned increased 4.8% over 2009, which increased 4.7% over 2008. The increases in premiums earned since 2008 were primarily due to increased international business. Underwriting results for the global life/health operations produced underwriting gains of $163million in 2010, $177million in 2009 and $179million in 2008. Overall results were profitable in each of the past three years driven by gains from the life business due primarily to favorable mortality.
32 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) InsuranceUnderwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group Through the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, we underwrite excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages on property and casualty risks for insurers and reinsurers worldwide. BHRGs business includes catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance and excess primary and facultative reinsurance for large or otherwise unusual discrete property risks referred to as individual risk. BHRG also writes retroactive reinsurance, which provides indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events. Other multi-line business refers to other property and casualty business written on both a quota-share and excess basis. Beginning in 2010, BHRGs underwriting activities include life reinsurance as well as a life annuity business, which in previous years was included in the finance and financial products segment. Amounts for 2009 and 2008 have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. BHRGs underwriting results are summarized in the table below. Amounts are inmillions.
Premiums earned Pre-taxunderwritinggain/loss 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Catastrophe and individual risk $ 623 $ 823 $ 955 $ 260 $ 782 $ 776 Retroactive reinsurance 2,621 1,989 204 (90 ) (448 ) (414 ) Other multi-line 3,459 3,894 3,923 203 15 962 Life and annuity 2,373   (197 ) (99 ) (102 ) $ 9,076 $ 6,706 $ 5,082 $ 176 $ 250 $ 1,222 Catastrophe and individual risk contracts may provide exceptionally large limits of indemnification and cover catastrophe risks (such as hurricanes, earthquakes or other natural disasters) or other property and liability risks. The timing and magnitude of losses produces extraordinary volatility in periodic underwriting results of this business. Catastrophe and individual risk premiums written were approximately $584million in 2010, $725million in 2009 and $1.1billion in 2008. The level of business that we write in a given period will vary significantly due to changes in market conditions and our managements assessment of the adequacy of premium rates. We constrained the volume of business written in 2010 as premium rates have not been attractive enough to warrant increasing volume. However, we have the capacity and willingness to write substantially more business when appropriate pricing can be obtained. Premiums earned from catastrophe and individual risk contracts in 2010 declined 24% from 2009 which declined 14% from 2008.
Underwriting results from catastrophe and individual risk business in 2010 included estimated losses of $322million arising from several significant property catastrophe and casualty loss occurrences in 2010. Underwriting results in 2009 reflected no significant losses from catastrophes during the year, while in 2008 we incurred approximately $270million of estimated losses from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Underwriting results in 2008 also included a gain of $224million from a contract in which we agreed to purchase, under certain conditions, up to $4billion of revenue bonds issued by the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund Finance Corporation. Our obligation was conditioned upon, among other things, the occurrence of a specified amount of Florida hurricane losses during a period that expired on December31, 2008 and which was not met.
Retroactive reinsurance policies generally provide very large, but limited, indemnification of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events that are generally expected to be paid over long periods of time. Premiums earned in 2010 included approximately $2.25billion from a reinsurance contract entered into with Continental Casualty Company, a subsidiary of CNA Financial Corporation, and several of its other insurance subsidiaries (collectively the CNA Companies). Under the terms of the reinsurance contract, BHRG assumed certain asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities of the CNA Companies subject to an aggregate limit of indemnification of $4billion of covered losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses. The premiums earned related to this contract were offset by a corresponding amount of losses incurred (comprised of estimated loss reserves of approximately $2.45billion less a deferred charge asset of approximately $200million), thus resulting in no immediate impact on underwriting results. Premiums earned from retroactive reinsurance in 2009 included 2.0billion Swiss Francs (approximately $1.7billion) from an adverse loss development contract with Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd. and its affiliates (Swiss Re) covering substantially all of Swiss Res non-life insurance losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses for loss events occurring prior to January1, 2009.
Underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance include the recurring amortization of deferred charges that are established with respect to these contracts. At the inception of a contract, deferred charges represent the difference between the premium received and the estimated ultimate losses payable. Deferred charges are subsequently amortized over the estimated claims 33 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) InsuranceUnderwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) payment period using the interest method and are based on estimates of the timing and amount of loss payments. Amortization charges are recorded as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. The relatively low underwriting losses in 2010 reflected the impact of net reductions in ultimate reserve estimates on certain large contracts and generally slower than expected loss payments, which resulted in lower rates of deferred charge amortization. At December31, 2010, unamortized deferred charges for all of BHRGs retroactive contracts were approximately $3.7billion and gross unpaid losses were approximately $18.7billion.
Other multi-line property and casualty premiums earned included $2.4billion in 2010, $2.8billion in 2009 and $1.8billion in 2008 from a 20% quota-share reinsurance contract with Swiss Re covering substantially all of Swiss Res property/casualty risks incepting from January1, 2008 and running through December31, 2012. Excluding the Swiss Re quota-share contract, premiums earned in 2010 from other multi-line business declined $75million (7%)from 2009, which declined $969million (46%)compared to 2008.
Underwriting results from other multi-line business are affected by the timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses and unrealized foreign currency transactions. Underwriting results in 2010 for our other multi-line business included estimated catastrophe losses of approximately $308million from the Chilean and New Zealand earthquakes, the Gulf of Mexico BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion and the Australian floods. There were no significant catastrophe losses in 2009. Underwriting results in 2008 included approximately $435million of estimated catastrophe losses from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Underwriting results also included losses of approximately $168million in 2010 and $280million in 2009 and gains of approximately $930million in 2008 from unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the conversion of certain reinsurance loss reserves and other liabilities denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars as of the balance sheet dates. Excluding the effects of the currency gains/losses, other multi-line business produced underwriting gains of $371million in 2010, $295million in 2009 and $32million in 2008.
In January 2010, BHRG entered in to a life reinsurance contract with Swiss Re Life& Health America Inc. (SRLHA). Under the agreement, BHRG assumed the liabilities and subsequent renewal premiums associated with a closed block of yearly renewable term reinsurance business reinsuring permanent and term products and universal life products written, assumed or subsequently acquired by SRLHA. BHRG assumes the mortality risk on the underlying lives with respect to the SRLHA business effective as of October1, 2009, until the underlying yearly renewable term reinsured policy non-renews or the insurer ceding the business to SRLHA recaptures the business. Premiums earned in 2010 from this contract were $2.1billion and underwriting losses were $83million. The agreement is expected to remain in-force for several decades and, over time, is expected to result in substantial premiums earned and life benefits incurred. The underwriting results of the life and annuity business also included periodic interest charges arising from accretion of discounted annuity reserves. At December31, 2010, the net reserves for all life and annuity benefits were approximately $2.8billion.
Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group Our primary insurance group consists of a wide variety of independently managed insurance businesses that principally write liability coverages for commercial accounts. These businesses include: Medical Protective Corporation (MedPro), a provider of professional liability insurance to physicians, dentists and other healthcare providers; National Indemnity Companys primary group (NICO Primary Group), writers of commercial motor vehicle and general liability coverages; U.S. Investment Corporation, whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to internally as Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies, providers of standard commercial multi-line insurance; Central States Indemnity Company, a provider of credit and disability insurance to individuals nationwide through financial institutions; Applied Underwriters, a provider of integrated workers compensation solutions; and BoatU.S., a writer of insurance for owners of boats and small watercraft.
Earned premiums by our primary insurance businesses were $1.7billion in 2010, $1.8billion in 2009 and $2.0billion in 2008. Premium volume of our primary insurers, in general, has been and continues to be constrained by soft market conditions and as a result, we are accepting less business. Underwriting gains as percentages of premiums earned were approximately 16% in 2010, 5% in 2009 and 11% in 2008. The improvement in underwriting results was primarily due to reductions of MedPros estimated prior years loss reserves and lower loss ratios of the Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies.
34 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) InsuranceInvestment Income A summary of net investment income of our insurance operations follows. Amounts are inmillions.
2010 2009 2008 Investment income before taxes, noncontrolling interests and equity method earnings $ 5,145 $ 5,459 $ 4,896 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,335 1,615 1,286 Net investment income before equity method earnings 3,810 3,844 3,610 Equity method earnings 50 427  Net investment income $ 3,860 $ 4,271 $ 3,610 Investment income consists of interest and dividends earned on cash and cash equivalents and investments attributable to our insurance businesses. Pre-tax investment income declined $314million (5.8%)compared with 2009. The decline in 2010 investment income reflected lower dividends earned from our investments in Wells Fargo common stock and the impact of a realized gain in 2009 of about $100million from a short-term currency transaction made in anticipation of our investment in the Swiss Re convertible capital instrument.
Pre-tax investment income in 2009 exceeded 2008 by $563million (11.5%). The increase in investment income in 2009 primarily reflected earnings from several large investments made in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first half of 2009, partially offset by lower earnings on cash and cash equivalents due to lower short-term interest rates and lower average cash balances.
In October2008, we acquired 11.45% subordinated notes and 5% preferred stock issued by Wrigley and preferred stocks of Goldman Sachs and General Electric that each pay an annual dividend of 10%. In March 2009, we acquired a 12% convertible capital instrument of Swiss Re and in April 2009, we acquired an 8.5% Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock of Dow. In December 2009, we also acquired $1.0billion par amount of senior notes issued by Wrigley. Approximately 85% of these securities were acquired by our insurance group, with the remainder primarily held in our finance and financial products businesses. Our insurance group earned about $1.8billion in 2010 and $1.7billion in 2009 in interest and dividends from the aforementioned investments.
Our investment income in 2011 may decline as compared to 2010 as a result of maturities and redemptions of higher yielding investments that occurred in 2010 and are expected to occur in 2011 and low interest rates currently available for reinvestment purposes. As a result, our cash and cash equivalent balances will likely increase during 2011. In November 2010, an agreement was entered into with Swiss Re providing for the redemption of the 12% capital instrument for aggregate consideration of approximately CHF 3.9billion. In addition, our investment in Goldman Sachs preferred stock may be redeemed at the option of Goldman Sachs at any time and our investment in General Electric preferred stock may be redeemed at the option of General Electric beginning in October 2011. We anticipate that both of these securities will be redeemed in 2011. The negative impact on investment income from these events may be partially offset to the extent that dividend rates increase with respect to certain of our major common stock investments.
Insurance investment income also includes earnings from equity method investments (BNSF and Moodys). Equity method earnings represented our proportionate share of the net earnings of these companies. As a result of a reduction of our ownership of Moodys in July of 2009, we discontinued the use of the equity method for our investment in Moodys as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2009. As a result of our acquisition of the remaining outstanding stock of BNSF on February12, 2010, we discontinued the use of the equity method and BNSFs accounts are now included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning as of February 13, 2010. Dividends received on equity method investments are not reflected in our earnings.
Invested assets derive from shareholder capital and reinvested earnings as well as net liabilities under insurance contracts or float. The major components of float are unpaid losses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $66billion at December31, 2010, $63billion at December31, 2009 and $60billion at December31, 2008, respectively. The cost of float, as represented by the ratio of underwriting gain or loss to average float, was negative for the last three years, as our insurance business generated underwriting gains in each year.

Non-investment grade securities represent securities that are rated below BBB- or Baa3.
Railroad (Burlington Northern Santa Fe) We acquired control of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation (BNSF) on February12, 2010. BNSFs revenues and operating results are included in our consolidated results beginning immediately after the acquisition. In 2009 and for the period between January1, 2010 and February12, 2010, we accounted for our interest in BNSF pursuant to the equity method. Our share of BNSFs earnings for those periods is included in net investment income of our insurance group. Earnings of BNSF following the acquisition are summarized below (inmillions). BNSFs earnings for the years ending December31, 2010 and 2009 are provided for comparison, although these results are not consolidated in our financial statements.

BNSFs major business groups are classified by product shipped and include consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. The discussion that follows compares BNSFs results for the years ending December31, 2010 and 2009.
Revenues for the year ending December31, 2010 were approximately $16.9 billion, representing an increase of approximately $2.8 billion (20%)over 2009. In 2010, revenues from each of the four business groups increased between 17% to 23% as compared to 2009. The increases reflected increased industrial products, agricultural products, consumer products and coal freight volume as well as overall increased yields. In addition, annual revenues in 2010 included an increase in fuel surcharges of $740million versus 2009.
Operating expenses in 2010 were $12.4billion, an increase of $1.6billion (15%)over 2009, reflecting an increase in costs to handle the increase in freight volume as well as higher fuel and wage costs. Fuel costs increased $644million in 2010 primarily due to higher prices. Compensation and benefits expense increased $523million in 2010 primarily due to increased incentive compensation, increased health and welfare expenses and general wage increases. Operating expenses in 2010 also reflected increased depreciation and amortization expense versus 2009.
Utilities and Energy (MidAmerican) Revenues and earnings of MidAmerican are summarized below. Amounts are inmillions.

We hold an 89.8% ownership interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (MidAmerican), which operates an international energy business. MidAmericans domestic regulated energy interests are comprised of two regulated utility companies and two interstate natural gas pipeline companies. In the United Kingdom, MidAmerican operates two electricity distribution businesses. The rates that our utilities and natural gas pipelines charge customers for energy and other services are generally subject to regulatory approval. Rates are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including a return on capital. To the extent we are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, MidAmerican also operates a diversified portfolio of independent power projects and the second-largest residential real estate brokerage firm in the United States.
Our U.S. based regulated utilities businesses are conducted through PacifiCorp and MidAmerican Energy Company (MEC). PacifiCorps revenues and earnings before corporate interest and taxes (EBIT) in 2010 were $4,518million and $783million, respectively, relatively unchanged from 2009. Revenues in 2010 reflected lower average wholesale prices and a decrease in wholesale sales volume of approximately 8%, offset by higher retail prices approved by regulators and higher 37 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) Utilities and Energy (MidAmerican) (Continued) renewable energy credit sales. PacifiCorps EBIT reflected decreased prices of purchased electricity and natural gas and lower natural gas volumes, offset by higher transmission costs from higher contract rates, higher volumes of purchased electricity and higher coal prices. Revenues of MEC in 2010 increased $113million (3%)over 2009, primarily due to higher volumes of regulated and non-regulated electricity sales which are attributable to higher customer usage, impacted by weather conditions and customer growth. MECs EBIT in 2010 was $279million, a slight decrease compared to 2009, primarily due to higher energy costs, operating expenses and depreciation and amortization. Energy costs increased due to higher coal prices and greater thermal generation as a result of higher sales volume. Operating expenses increased due to higher maintenance costs from plant outages and storm damages.
PacifiCorps revenues in 2009 of $4,543million were relatively unchanged from 2008. Revenues in 2009 reflect an overall decrease in sales volume (both wholesale and retail) of approximately 2% and lower wholesale prices, somewhat offset by higher retail prices approved by regulators and higher renewable energy credit sales. PacifiCorps EBIT in 2009 of $788million increased $85million (12%)over 2008, primarily due to lower volume and prices of energy purchased in response to lower sales volumes and the use of lower-cost generation facilities put into service in the second half of 2008 and first quarter of 2009. Revenues of MEC in 2009 declined $1,031million (22%)from 2008, primarily due to lower regulated natural gas and electricity sales. Regulated natural gas revenues decreased by $520million in 2009, primarily due to a lower average per-unit cost of gas sold, which is passed on to customers and a 5% decline in sales volume. MECs regulated electricity revenues declined $315million primarily as a result of a 35% decline in average wholesale prices and lower volumes, which were attributable to reduced demand due to economic conditions as well as mild temperatures in 2009. MECs EBIT in 2009 declined $140million (33%)compared to 2008, primarily due to the lower regulated electricity revenues and increased depreciation due to additions of new wind-power generation facilities, partially offset by lower costs of purchased electricity and natural gas.
Our natural gas pipeline businesses are conducted through Northern Natural Gas and Kern River. Natural gas pipelines revenues and EBIT each declined $79million in 2010 from 2009. The declines were primarily due to lower transportation volume resulting from less favorable economic conditions and lower natural gas price spreads. Natural gas pipelines revenues and EBIT in 2009 declined $148million and $138million, respectively, from 2008 due primarily to lower volumes due to the economic climate, lower price spreads and the effects of a favorable rate proceeding included in the results for 2008.
U.K. utility revenues decreased $25million in 2010 from 2009 due to lower contracting revenue and lower gas production, partially offset by higher distribution revenue. The $85million increase in EBIT is due to the sale of CE Gas (Australia) Limited during 2010 and an impairment of certain assets that was recorded during 2009. U.K. utility revenues in 2009 declined $172million (17%)versus 2008, principally due to the impact from foreign currency exchange rates as a result of a stronger U.S.Dollar in 2009 as compared with 2008. EBIT of the U.K. utilities in 2009 declined $91million (27%)compared to 2008. The decline in EBIT reflects foreign currency exchange rate changes as well as higher depreciation expense and charges to write down certain exploration and development assets.
EBIT of the real estate brokerage business of $42million in 2010 was relatively unchanged as compared to 2009. The real estate brokerage business incurred a loss of $45million in 2008 that resulted from the weak U.S. housing markets.
EBIT from other activities increased in 2010 as compared to 2009 due primarily to stock-based compensation expense of $125million in 2009, as a result of MidAmericans purchase of common stock upon the exercise of the last remaining stock options that had been granted to certain members of management at the time of Berkshires acquisition of MidAmerican in 2000. EBIT from other activities in 2008 includes approximately $1.1billion related to our investment in Constellation Energy and a related breakup fee we received from Constellation Energy.
38 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows. Amounts are inmillions.
Revenues Earnings 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Marmon $ 5,967 $ 5,067 $ 5,529 $ 813 $ 686 $ 733 McLane Company 32,687 31,207 29,852 369 344 276 Other manufacturing 17,664 15,937 19,179 1,911 958 1,880 Other service 7,355 6,585 8,435 984 (91 ) 971 Retailing 2,937 2,869 3,104 197 161 163 $ 66,610 $ 61,665 $ 66,099 Pre-tax earnings $ 4,274 $ 2,058 $ 4,023 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,812 945 1,740 $ 2,462 $ 1,113 $ 2,283 Marmon We acquired a 60% controlling interest in Marmon Holdings, Inc. (Marmon) on March18, 2008 and as of December31, 2010 we owned approximately 64% of its outstanding common stock. In the first quarter of 2011, we will acquire additional shares and increase our ownership interest to about 80.2%. Marmons revenues, costs and expenses are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning as of the initial acquisition date in 2008. Through Marmon, we operate approximately 130 manufacturing and service businesses that operate independently within eleven diverse business sectors.
Marmons revenues in 2010 were $5,967million, an increase of approximately 18% over 2009. About 40% of the revenues increase was the result of increased copper prices, the cost of which is passed to customers with little or no margin. The balance of the revenues increase in 2010 was associated with a gradual rebound in other sectors as Marmons end markets improved from 2009s low levels. Earnings in 2010 increased $127million (19%)to $813million in comparison with 2009. Revenues in 2010 increased in all sectors, except Transportation Services & Engineered Products and Water Treatment sectors. With the exception of Distribution Services, all sectors had improvement in earnings in 2010. Earnings as a percent of revenues were 13.6% in 2010 and 13.5% in 2009. Operating margins in 2010 were negatively impacted by the increase in copper prices. The Transportation Services & Engineered Products and Building Wire sectors had the largest increases in earnings in 2010 compared to 2009. Earnings in 2010 also benefitted from lower interest expense.
Revenues in 2009 declined approximately 27% from 2008 (including periods in 2008 prior to our acquisition). The revenue decline in 2009 reflected the impact of the recession which led to lower customer demand across all sectors, and particularly in the Building Wire, Engineered Wire & Cable, Flow Products and Distribution Services sectors. Pre-tax earnings in 2009 declined approximately 26% from the full year of 2008 which reflects the decline in revenues, somewhat offset by a $160million reduction in operating costs resulting from cost reduction efforts. In 2009, the Retail Store Fixtures, Food Service Equipment and Water Treatment sectors produced comparable or improved earnings with 2008 despite lower revenues. The remaining sectors experienced lower earnings in 2009 compared to 2008.
McLane Company Through McLane, we operate a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food products to retailers, convenience stores and restaurants. McLanes business is marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins, and the fact that about 30% of its annual revenues are from sales to Wal-Mart. A curtailment of purchasing by Wal-Mart could have a material adverse impact on McLanes earnings. In 2010, McLane acquired Empire Distributors, based in Georgia and North Carolina and Horizon Wine and Spirits Inc., based in Tennessee. Empire and Horizon are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer.
McLanes revenues in 2010 were approximately $32.7billion, representing an increase of $1.5billion (5%)over 2009 reflecting an 11% increase in foodservice revenues (driven by increased unit volume) and a relatively minor increase in grocery revenues. Pre-tax earnings in 2010 of $369million increased $25million (7%)over 2009. The increase in earnings in 2010 39 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) McLane Company (Continued) reflected the favorable impact of the Empire and Horizon acquisitions and increased foodservice earnings, partially offset by lower earnings from the grocery unit. Earnings in 2009 included the impact of a substantial inventory price change gain in the grocery unit associated with an increase in federal excise taxes on cigarettes. Many tobacco manufacturers raised prices in anticipation of the tax increase, which allowed McLane to generate a one-time price change gain. The combined gross margin rate in 2010 was 5.75% versus 5.72% in 2009. McLane continues to maintain tight control over operating expenses.
Revenues were $31.2billion in 2009, an increase of $1.4billion (5%)compared to 2008. The increase in revenues in 2009 reflected an 8% increase in the grocery business, partially offset by an 11% decline from the foodservice business. The revenue increases in 2009 reflected additional grocery customers as well as manufacturer price increases and state excise tax increases. Pre-tax earnings in 2009 increased $68million (25%)over 2008. Earnings in 2009 included the impact of the aforementioned inventory price change gain. The comparative increase in earnings in 2009 from the inventory price change gain was partially offset by a related one-time floor stock tax and by lower earnings from the foodservice business. Operating results in 2009 also benefited from lower fuel costs and operating expense control efforts.
Other manufacturing Our other manufacturing businesses include a wide array of businesses. Included in this group are several manufacturers of building products (Acme Building Brands, Benjamin Moore, Johns Manville, Shaw and MiTek) and apparel (led by Fruit of the Loom which includes the Russell athletic apparel and sporting goods business and the Vanity Fair Brands womens intimate apparel business). Among other businesses also included in this group are Forest River, a leading manufacturer of leisure vehicles, ISCAR Metalworking Companies (IMC), an industry leader in the metal cutting tools business with operations worldwide and CTB International (CTB), a manufacturer of equipment for the livestock and agricultural industry.
Revenues from our other manufacturing activities in 2010 were $17.7billion, an increase of $1.7billion (11%)over 2009. The increase was primarily due to volume driven revenue increases of Forest River (57%), IMC (41%), CTB (20%)and Johns Manville (12%). These operations rebounded in 2010 from slow business activity in 2009. Despite the increase in revenues by Johns Manville, our building products operations continue to be adversely affected by the overall soft residential and commercial real estate conditions.
Pre-tax earnings of our other manufacturing businesses in 2010 increased $953million (99%)compared with earnings in 2009. The improvements in earnings in 2010 were driven by significant earnings increases at almost all of our manufacturing businesses, including our apparel and building products businesses. In particular, Fruit of the Looms operating results significantly improved primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies and cost management efforts. Increased earnings at IMC and Forest River were primarily a result of the aforementioned revenue growth. Overall, our manufacturing businesses benefitted in 2010 from higher customer demand and the impact of their cost containment efforts over the past two years.
Nearly all of the businesses in our manufacturing group experienced the adverse effects of the global economic recession in 2009 as consumers and customers cut purchases. Revenues in 2009 were $15.9billion, a decrease of $3.2billion (17%)from 2008. Revenues were lower for apparel (11%), building products (20%)and other businesses (16%)as compared to 2008. Pre-tax earnings of our other manufacturing businesses were $958million in 2009, a decrease of $922million (49%)versus 2008. The declines in earnings reflected the lower revenues as well as relatively higher costs resulting from lower manufacturing efficiencies.
Other service Our other service businesses include NetJets, the worlds leading provider of fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft, and FlightSafety, a provider of high technology training to operators of aircraft. Among the other businesses also included in this group are: TTI, a leading electronic components distributor; Business Wire, a leading distributor of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings; The Pampered Chef, a direct seller of high quality kitchen tools; International Dairy Queen, a licensor and service provider to about 6,000 stores that offer prepared dairy treats and food; The Buffalo News, a publisher of a daily and Sunday newspaper; and businesses that provide management and other services to insurance companies.
40 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Other service (Continued) In 2010, revenues of our other service businesses were $7.4billion, an increase of $770million (12%)compared to 2009. Pre-tax earnings in 2010 were $984million compared to a loss of $91million in 2009. The improved results were significantly driven by improved operating results of NetJets and TTI.
In 2010, NetJets revenues increased 7% over 2009. The increase was due to higher worldwide flight revenue hours and increased pass through costs, partially offset by lower management fees due to fewer aircraft in the NetJets program. NetJets generated pre-tax earnings of $207million in 2010 compared to a pre-tax loss of $711million in 2009, which included $676million of asset writedowns and other downsizing costs. The asset write downs were primarily related to excess aircraft that have been subsequently sold or are expected to be sold for cash consideration approximating their written down values. Such costs in 2010 were relatively minor. On January1, 2010, we began charging NetJets a guarantee fee related to the level of its outstanding debt. The guarantee fee was $38million in 2010. Had a similar fee been charged in 2009, NetJets pre-tax loss of $711million would have increased by $69million. The improvement in earnings was due to the increase in revenues and to an overall reduction in flight operations and administrative costs, partially offset by higher fuel costs. NetJets continues to own more aircraft than is required for present operations and we expect to continue to dispose of selected aircraft over time. NetJets operating cost structure has been reduced to better match customer demand and we believe that NetJets will continue to operate profitably in the future.
In 2010, revenues of TTI increased by approximately 45% over 2009 which was driven by very strong worldwide demand. We primarily attribute the revenue increase to strong consumer demand for electronic products, as well as to manufacturers replenishing depleted raw material inventories. We believe that the current strong market conditions will slow to more normalized levels and as a result, we anticipate that revenues growth will slow significantly from the extraordinary rate experienced in 2010. As a result of the increase in revenues, pre-tax earnings of TTI were significantly higher in 2010 compared to 2009.
Revenues in 2009 were $6.6billion, a decrease of $1.9 billion (22%)compared to 2008. Substantially all of our service businesses generated lower revenues in 2009 as compared to 2008, particularly at NetJets and to a lesser degree at TTI. In 2009, NetJets revenues declined 32% versus 2008 due to a 77% decline in aircraft sales as well as lower flight operations revenues primarily due to a 19% decline in flight revenue hours. Revenues at TTI were 17% lower in 2009 compared to 2008 due to the economic recession. NetJets produced a pre-tax loss in 2009 of $711million compared to pre-tax earnings of $213million in 2008. The pre-tax loss at NetJets in 2009 included the aforementioned asset writedowns and other downsizing costs of $676million compared to $54million of such charges in 2008. Excluding the results of NetJets, our other service businesses produced pre-tax earnings of $620million in 2009 compared to pre-tax earnings of $758million in 2008. The negative impact of the global recession was evident at substantially all of our other service businesses.
Retailing Our retailing operations consist of four home furnishings businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordans), three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge) and Sees Candies. In 2010, revenues were $2.9billion, an increase of 2% compared to 2009 and pre-tax earnings were $197million, an increase of 22% compared to 2009. The increase in earnings in 2010 was due to the modest increase in sales and ongoing cost containment efforts. Retailing revenues in 2009 decreased 8% compared to 2008. Pre-tax earnings of $161million in 2009 were relatively unchanged from 2008. Throughout 2008 as the impact of the economic recession in the U.S. worsened, consumer spending declined and these conditions continued in 2009.
41 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) Finance and Financial Products A summary of revenues and earnings from our finance and financial products businesses follows. Amounts are inmillions.
Revenues Earnings 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Manufactured housing and finance $ 3,256 $ 3,257 $ 3,560 $ 176 $ 187 $ 206 Furniture/transportation equipment leasing 660 661 773 53 14 87 Other 348 383 440 460 452 478 $ 4,264 $ 4,301 $ 4,773 Pre-tax earnings 689 653 771 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 248 242 302 $ 441 $ 411 $ 469 Revenues in 2010 from our manufactured housing and finance business (Clayton Homes) of $3.3billion were relatively unchanged from 2009. Sales of manufactured homes declined approximately $40million in 2010 versus 2009, reflecting an increase in unit sales of approximately 6% which was more than offset by lower average selling prices primarily attributable to product mix. Unit sales in the first half of 2010 benefitted from the home buyer tax credit, which expired in the second quarter and as a result demand declined over the last half of the year. Interest and finance income increased in 2010 as a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement, which required us to consolidate securitized loan portfolios we originated several years ago.
The operating results of Clayton Homes have been negatively affected by the economic recession as well as the credit crisis. In addition, our manufactured housing programs have been at a competitive disadvantage compared to traditional single family housing markets, which have been receiving significant interest rate subsidies from the U.S. government through government agency insured mortgages. For the most part, these subsidies are not available to factory built homes. As a result, manufactured housing construction, sales and related lending activities have been negatively impacted. Nevertheless, Clayton Homes remains the largest manufactured housing business in the United States and we believe that it will continue to operate profitably, even under the current conditions.
Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes in 2010 decreased $11million (6%)versus 2009. Operating results in 2010 were negatively impacted by reduced earnings from manufactured home sales, partially offset by increased financial services earnings. Installment loan balances were approximately $13.5billion as of December31, 2010 (including about $1.3billion related to securitized loans consolidated in 2010) versus $12.3billion as of December31, 2009.
Revenues in 2009 of Clayton Homes declined $303million (9%)from 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a 16% decline in units sold, partially offset by higher average selling prices and a slight increase in installment loan interest and other investment income. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were $187million in 2009, a decline of $19million (9%)from 2008. Pre-tax earnings in 2009 were negatively impacted by a $79million increase in estimated loan loss provisions, partially offset by improved margins from manufactured home sales and lower selling, general and administrative expenses arising from cost reduction efforts.
Revenues from our furniture and transportation equipment leasing activities in 2010 were relatively unchanged from 2009. Pre-tax earnings in 2010 were $53million, an increase of $39million over 2009. The earnings increase in 2010 was primarily attributable to cost containment efforts as well as improved transportation equipment utilization.
Revenues and pre-tax earnings from our furniture/transportation equipment leasing businesses in 2009 declined $112million (14%)and $73million (84%), respectively, compared to 2008. The declines primarily reflected lower rental income driven by relatively low utilization rates for over-the-road trailer and storage units, and lower furniture rentals. Significant cost components of this business are fixed (depreciation and facility expenses), so earnings declined disproportionately to revenues.
Other finance business earnings include investment income generated on fixed maturity and equity investments, including portions of our investments in Goldman Sachs and Wrigley securities as well as revenues and earnings from other miscellaneous activities. In addition, other activities include earnings from internal interest rate spreads charged to Clayton Homes on 42 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) Finance and Financial Products (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporations (BHFC) borrowings ($11.5billion as of December31, 2010), which are used in connection with Clayton Homes installment lending activities. A corresponding charge is reflected in the manufactured housing and finance earnings. Also included in other finance business activity is the guaranty fee of $38 million that was due from NetJets in 2010. As previously discussed, NetJets recorded a corresponding charge to its 2010 earnings.
Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments follows. Amounts are inmillions.
2010 2009 2008 Investment gains/losses Sales and other disposals of investments Insurance and other $ 3,032 $ 277 $ 912 Finance and financial products 9 110 6 Other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments (1,973 ) (3,155 ) (1,813 ) Other 1,017 (69 ) 255 2,085 (2,837 ) (640 ) Derivative gains/losses Credit default contracts 250 789 (1,774 ) Equity index put option contracts 172 2,713 (5,028 ) Other derivative contracts (161 ) 122 (19 ) 261 3,624 (6,821 ) Gains/losses before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 2,346 787 (7,461 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 472 301 (2,816 ) Net gains/losses $ 1,874 $ 486 $ (4,645 ) Investment gains or losses are recognized upon the sales of investments or as otherwise required under GAAP. The timing of realized gains or losses from sales can have a material effect on periodic earnings. However, such gains or losses usually have little, if any, impact on total shareholders equity because most equity and fixed maturity investments are carried at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses included as components of accumulated other comprehensive income. In 2010, investment gains/losses on sales and other disposals of investments included a $1.3 billion gain with respect to the redemption of the Swiss Re 12% convertible capital instrument and other investment gains/losses included a one-time holding gain of $979million in connection with our acquisition of BNSF (see Notes 2 and 5).
The recognition of other-than-temporary impairment losses results in reductions in the cost basis of the investments but not a reduction in fair value and the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment loss has little if any impact on our shareholders equity and book value per share. Although we have recorded other-than-temporary impairment losses in earnings in each of the past three years, we continue to hold positions in many of these securities. The recognition of such losses does not necessarily indicate that sales are imminent or planned and sales ultimately may not occur. Furthermore, the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment losses does not necessarily indicate that the loss in value of the security is either permanent or that the market price of the security will not subsequently increase to and ultimately exceed our original cost by a substantial margin.
We collectively consider several factors in determining other-than-temporary impairment losses including the current and expected long-term business prospects of the issuer, our ability and intent to hold the investment until the price recovers and the length of time and relative magnitude of the price decline. We further recognize that stock prices may remain below intrinsic value for a period of time that is deemed excessive. As a result, other-than-temporary impairment losses may be recorded in these instances, even though we may strongly believe that the stock price will recover to at least its original cost and we currently possess the ability and intent to hold the security until, at least, that time.
Other-than-temporary impairment losses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 included unrealized losses on individual equity securities of $938million (determined on a specific identification basis). Such losses averaged about 20% of the original 43 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued) cost of the impaired securities. In each case, the issuer has been profitable in recent periods and in some cases highly profitable. Although we expect that these businesses will continue to remain profitable and that the market prices for these securities will eventually exceed our original cost, we could not establish sufficient objective evidence as to the timing or amount of the future recovery in market prices. We also recorded other-than-temporary impairment losses of about $1.0billion on certain debt instruments where, after evaluation, we concluded that we would likely not receive all contractual cash flows when due.
Other-than-temporary impairment losses in 2009 predominantly relate to a loss with respect to our investment in ConocoPhillips common stock. The market price of ConocoPhillips shares declined sharply over the last half of 2008. In 2009, we sold over half of the ConocoPhillips position we held at the end of 2008. Sales in 2009 were in anticipation of other investment opportunities, to increase overall liquidity and to realize capital losses that were carried back to prior years for income tax purposes. We continue to hold over 29million shares of ConocoPhillips and its market price as of December31, 2010 was about 75% over its market price at the time we recorded the aforementioned other-than-temporary impairment loss. None of the subsequent recovery in the market price of ConocoPhillips currently held is reflected in our net earnings but it is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Other-than-temporary impairment losses recorded in 2008 were primarily related to investments in twelve equity securities. The unrealized losses in these securities generally ranged from 40% to 90% of cost. After reviewing these investments, we concluded that there was considerable uncertainty in the business prospects of these companies and thus uncertainty on the recoverability of the cost of the security.
Derivative gains/losses primarily represent the changes in fair value of our credit default and equity index put option contracts. Changes in the fair values of these contracts are reflected in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of equity and credit markets. We have not actively traded into and out of credit default and equity index put option contracts. Under many of the contracts, no settlements will occur until the contract expiration dates, many years from now. We reported pre-tax gains on our credit default contracts of $250million in 2010, $789million in 2009 and pre-tax losses of $1.8billion in 2008. These gains and losses reflect the changes in the fair values of these contracts. The fair values of our credit default contracts are impacted by changes in credit default spreads, which have been volatile from period to period. The gains in 2010 reflected the overall narrowing of credit default spreads for corporate issuers and were somewhat offset by losses due to the widening of spreads for municipalities, particularly in the fourth quarter. There were no credit loss events on our contracts in 2010. The gains and losses from our credit default contracts in 2009 and 2008 derived primarily from changes in the fair value of our liabilities due to a significant widening of credit default spreads of corporate issuers in 2008 and the narrowing of spreads for corporate issuers in 2009. There were several credit loss events in the second half of 2008 and the beginning of 2009, primarily related to contracts involving non-investment grade (or high-yield) corporate issuers and during 2009 we paid losses of about $1.9billion.
In 2010 and 2009, gains on equity index put option contracts were $172million and $2.7billion, respectively compared to losses of $5.0billion in 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we settled certain equity index put option contracts early at the request of the counterparty. The net gain in 2010 arising from these settled contracts was $561million, which is represented by the difference between the recorded fair values of the contracts at December31, 2009 and the settlement payment amounts. Otherwise, we recognized pre-tax losses of $389million under our remaining equity index put option contracts reflecting generally lower interest rate assumptions and the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes. The derivative contract gains in 2009 reflected increases in the underlying equity indexes ranging from approximately 19% to 23%, partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S.Dollar on non-U.S. contracts and lower interest rates. These factors combined to produce a decrease in our estimated liabilities. The losses in 2008 reflected declines of between 30%and 45% in underlying equity indexes. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our remaining equity index put option contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates, which begin in 2018. Except for the early settlements referred to previously, there have been no other cash settlements related to these contracts.
Financial Condition Our balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Our consolidated shareholders equity at December31, 2010 was $157.3billion, an increase of $26.2billion from December31, 2009. The increase in our shareholders equity included approximately $10.6billion related to the issuance of Berkshire common stock in connection with the BNSF acquisition.
44 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) Consolidated cash and investments of insurance and other businesses approximated $147.7billion at December 31, 2010 including cash and cash equivalents of $34.8billion. These assets are held predominantly in our insurance businesses. In February 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of BNSF common stock that we did not already own for aggregate consideration of approximately $26.5billion. The consideration paid included $15.9billion in cash consisting of $8.0billion in proceeds from newly issued parent company debt (which included $2.0billion that matured in February 2011) and $7.9billion of cash on hand, plus Berkshire ClassA and B common stock with an aggregate value of approximately $10.6billion.
Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses conducted by MidAmerican and BNSF maintain very large investments in property, plant and equipment and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Capital expenditures of MidAmerican in 2010 were approximately $2.6billion. For the period between February13, 2010 and December31, 2010, BNSFs capital expenditures were approximately $2.3billion, including additions to other assets. MidAmericans forecasted capital expenditures for 2011 are approximately $3.1billion. BNSFs forecasted capital expenditures and commitments for 2011 are approximately $3.5billion. Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded from cash flows from operations and debt proceeds. Aggregate borrowings of the railroad, utilities and energy businesses were about $31.6billion as of December31, 2010, including $12.0billion of borrowings of BNSF. BNSF, MidAmerican, and their operating subsidiaries have debt and capital lease maturities in 2011 of approximately $2.2billion. Berkshire has committed until February28, 2011 to provide up to $3.5billion of additional capital to MidAmerican to permit the repayment of its debt obligations or to fund its regulated utility subsidiaries. In 2010, the commitment was amended to extend the term of the commitment to February28, 2014 and to reduce the commitment to $2billion beginning on March1, 2011. Berkshire does not intend to guarantee the repayment of debt by BNSF, MidAmerican or any of their subsidiaries.
Assets of the finance and financial products businesses, which consisted primarily of loans and finance receivables, fixed maturity securities, other investments and cash and cash equivalents, were approximately $25.7billion as of December31, 2010 and $25.1billion at December31, 2009. Liabilities were approximately $24.0billion as of December31, 2010 and 2009. As of December31, 2010, notes payable and other borrowings of $14.5billion included approximately $11.5billion par amount of notes issued by BHFC. In 2010, BHFC issued at various dates, notes with aggregate par amounts of $1.5billion and repaid maturing notes with aggregate par amounts of $2.0billion. In January 2011, BHFC issued an additional $1.5billion of notes and repaid $1.5billion of maturing notes. BHFC notes are unsecured and mature at various dates from 2011 to 2040. The proceeds from the BHFC notes are used to finance originated and acquired loans of Clayton Homes. The full and timely payment of principal and interest on the BHFC notes is guaranteed by Berkshire. Other debt of our finance and financial products businesses increased in 2010 by approximately $1.2billion to $2.9billion primarily due to the adoption of ASU 2009-16 and ASU 2009-17, which eliminated the concept of qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs) and the exemption of QSPEs from previous consolidation guidance and which amended the standards related to consolidation of variable interest entities. See Note 1(t) and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
During 2008 and continuing into the first part of 2009, access to credit markets became limited as a consequence of a worldwide credit crisis. However, management believes that the credit crisis has abated and as a result, interest rates for investment grade issuers relative to government obligations have declined. Nevertheless, restricted access to credit markets at affordable rates in the future could have a significant negative impact on our operations, particularly the railroad, utilities and energy and the finance and financial products operations. On July21, 2010, President Obama signed into law financial regulatory reform legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Reform Act). The Reform Act reshapes financial regulations in the United States by creating new regulators, regulating new markets and firms, and providing new enforcement powers to regulators. Virtually all major areas of the Reform Act will be subject to regulatory interpretation and implementation rules requiring rulemaking that may take several years to complete.
We are party to several equity put option and credit default contracts as described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. With limited exception, these contracts contain no collateral posting requirements under any circumstances, including changes in either the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts or a downgrade in Berkshires credit ratings. Substantially all of these contracts were entered into prior to December31, 2008. At December31, 2010, the net liabilities recorded for such contracts were approximately $8.0billion and our collateral posting requirements were $31million. With respect to such collateral requirements, we receive the income attributable to such collateral or, in certain instances, interest credit from the counterparty. Although the ultimate outcome of the regulatory rulemaking proceedings described in the preceding paragraph cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the provisions of the Reform Act that concern collateral requirements apply to derivatives contracts that were entered into prior to the enactment of the Reform Act, as ours 45 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) were. As such, although the Reform Act may affect some of our business activities, it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial results or financial condition.
Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertain to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, which are not currently reflected in the financial statements, such as minimum rentals under operating leases. Such obligations will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided. Amounts due as of the balance sheet date for purchases where the goods and services have been received and a liability incurred are not included to the extent that such amounts are due within one year of the balance sheet date.
The timing and/or amount of the payments of other obligations are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from estimates reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The timing and amount of payments arising under property and casualty insurance and derivative contract obligations which are reported in other in the table below are contingent upon the outcome of claim settlement activities that will occur over many years. Obligations arising under life, annuity and health insurance benefits are estimated based on assumptions as to future premium payments, allowances, mortality, morbidity, expenses and policy lapse rates. The amounts presented in the following table are based on the liability estimates reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December31, 2010. Although certain insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses and life, annuity and health benefits are ceded to and recoverable from others under reinsurance contracts, such recoverables are not reflected in the table below.
A summary of contractual obligations as of December31, 2010 follows. Amounts are inmillions.

Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates are necessarily based on assumptions about numerous factors involving varying, and possibly significant, degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements, with the benefit of hindsight, will likely be adjusted in the future based on additional information made available and changes in other facts and circumstances.
46 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses A summary of our consolidated liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses is presented in the table below. Except for certain workers compensation reserves, liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses (referred to in this section as gross unpaid losses) are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets without discounting for time value, regardless of the length of the claim-tail. Amounts are inmillions.
Gross unpaid losses Net unpaid losses* Dec.31,2010 Dec.31,2009 Dec.31,2010 Dec.31,2009 GEICO $ 9,376 $ 8,561 $ 8,928 $ 8,211 General Re 16,425 17,594 15,690 16,170 BHRG 29,124 28,109 24,422 23,150 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 5,150 5,152 4,802 4,774 Total $ 60,075 $ 59,416 $ 53,842 $ 52,305 * Net of reinsurance recoverable and deferred charges on reinsurance assumed and before foreign currency translation effects.
We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts with respect to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of loss payments is subject to a great degree of variability and is contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and cedants and the determination of the ultimate amount through the loss adjustment process. A variety of techniques are used in establishing the liabilities for unpaid losses. Regardless of the techniques used, significant judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate amounts payable in the future. As a result, uncertainties are imbedded in and permeate the actuarial loss reserving techniques and processes used.
As of any balance sheet date, not all claims that have occurred have been reported and not all reported claims have been settled. Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include provisions for reported claims (referred to as case reserves) and for claims that have not been reported (referred to as incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) reserves). The time period between the loss occurrence date and settlement payment date is referred to as the claim-tail. Property claims usually have fairly short claim-tails and, absent litigation, are reported and settled within a few years of occurrence. Casualty losses usually have very long claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations. The legal environment further contributes to extending claim-tails.
Receivables are recorded with respect to losses ceded to other reinsurers and are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses. In addition to the factors cited above, reinsurance recoverables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders.
We utilize loss reserving techniques that are believed to best fit the particular business. Additional information regarding reserving processes of our significant insurance businesses (GEICO, General Re and BHRG) follows.
GEICO GEICOs gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves as of December31, 2010 were $9.4billion. Gross reserves included $6.8billion of reported average, case and case development reserves and $2.6billion of IBNR reserves. GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance which has a relatively short claim-tail. The key assumptions affecting the setting of our reserves include projections of ultimate claim counts (frequency) and average loss per claim (severity), which includes loss adjustment expenses.
Our reserving methodologies produce reserve estimates based upon the individual claims (or a ground-up approach), which yields an aggregate estimate of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. Ranges of loss estimates are not determined in the aggregate.
Our actuaries establish and evaluate unpaid loss reserves using recognized standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The significant reserve components (and percentage of gross reserves as of December 31, 2010) are: (1)average reserves (15%), (2)case and case development reserves (60%)and (3)IBNR reserves (25%). Each component of loss reserves 47 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) GEICO (Continued) is affected by the expected frequency and average severity of claims. Such amounts are analyzed using statistical techniques on historical claims data and adjusted when appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Data is analyzed by policy coverage, rated state, reporting date and occurrence date, among other factors. A brief discussion of each reserve component follows.
We establish average reserve amounts for reported auto damage claims and new liability claims prior to the development of an individual case reserve. The average reserves are intended to represent a reasonable estimate for incurred claims for which our claims adjusters have insufficient time and information to make specific claim estimates and for a large number of minor physical damage claims that are paid within a relatively short time after being reported. Average reserve amounts are driven by the estimated average severity per claim and the number of new claims opened.
Our claims adjusters generally establish individual liability claim case loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates as soon as the specific facts and merits of each claim can be evaluated. Case reserves represent the amounts that in the judgment of the adjusters are reasonably expected to be paid in the future to completely settle the claim, including expenses. Individual case reserves are revised as more information becomes known.
For most liability coverages, case reserves alone are an insufficient measure of the ultimate cost due in part to the longer claim-tail, the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts available at the time the case reserve is established. Therefore, we establish additional case development reserve estimates, which are usually percentages of the case reserve. As of December31, 2010, case development reserves averaged approximately 25% of total established case reserves. In general, case development factors are selected by a retrospective analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case reserves. Case development factors are reviewed and revised periodically.
For unreported claims, IBNR reserve estimates are calculated by first projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage by using historical quarterly and monthly claim counts to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by accident quarter. Reported claims are subtracted from the ultimate claim projections to produce an estimate of the number of unreported claims. The number of unreported claims is multiplied by an estimate of the average cost per unreported claim to produce the IBNR reserve amount. Actuarial techniques are difficult to apply reliably in certain situations, such as to new legal precedents, class action suits or recent catastrophes. Consequently, supplemental IBNR reserves for these types of events may be established through the collaborative effort of actuarial, claims and other management.
For each significant coverage, we test the adequacy of the total loss reserves using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, paid loss triangles and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost.
Loss reserve estimates recorded at the end of 2009 developed downward by $507million when reevaluated through December31, 2010, producing a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings in 2010. These downward reserve developments represented approximately 3.6% of earned premiums in 2010 and approximately 5.9% of the prior year-end reserve amount. Reserving assumptions at December31, 2010 were modified appropriately to reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future reserve development will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or less than anticipated.
Within the automobile line of business, reserves for liability coverages are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails. Approximately 90% of GEICOs reserves as of December31, 2010 were for automobile liability, of which bodily injury (BI) coverage accounted for approximately 55%. We believe it is reasonably possible that the average BI severity will change by at least one percentage point from the severity used. If actual BI severity changes one percentage point from what was used in establishing the reserves, our reserves would develop up or down by approximately $132million resulting in a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the same economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to be different from expected would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction.
Our exposure at GEICO to highly uncertain losses is believed to be limited to certain commercial excess umbrella policies written during a period from 1981 to 1984. Remaining reserves associated with such exposure are currently a relatively insignificant component of GEICOs total reserves (approximately 2.1%) and there is minimal apparent asbestos or environmental liability exposure. Related claim activity over the past year was insignificant.
48 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re and BHRG Property and casualty loss reserves of our General Re and BHRG underwriting units derive primarily from assumed reinsurance. Additional uncertainties are unique to loss reserving processes for reinsurance. The nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage, the contractual reporting terms (which are affected by market conditions and practices) and other factors. Due to the lack of standardization of contract terms and conditions, the wide variability of coverage needs of individual clients and the tendency for those needs to change rapidly in response to market conditions, the ongoing economic impact of such uncertainties, in and of themselves, cannot be reliably measured.
The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative, per occurrence excess or retroactive contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract. This occurs when company personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claims or manage the claims themselves. However, loss information from aggregate excess-of-loss contracts, including catastrophe losses and quota-share treaties, is often less detailed. Occasionally, loss information is reported in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data is usually provided through periodic reports and may include the amount of ceded losses paid where reimbursement is sought as well as case loss reserve estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide IBNR estimates to reinsurers.
Each of our reinsurance businesses has established practices to identify and gather needed information from clients. These practices include, for example, comparison of expected premiums to reported premiums to help identify delinquent client reports and claim reviews to facilitate loss reporting and identify inaccurate or incomplete claim reporting. These practices are periodically evaluated and changed as conditions, risk factors and unanticipated areas of exposures are identified.
The timing of claim reporting to reinsurers is delayed in comparison with primary insurance. In some instances there are multiple reinsurers assuming and ceding parts of an underlying risk causing multiple contractual intermediaries between us and the primary insured. In these instances, the delays in reporting can be compounded. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer varies depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms and other factors. Contracts covering casualty losses on a per occurrence excess basis may experience longer delays in reporting due to the length of the claim-tail as regards to the underlying claim. In addition, ceding companies may not report claims to the reinsurer until they believe it is reasonably possible that the reinsurer will be affected, usually determined as a function of its estimate of the claim amount as a percentage of the reinsurance contract retention. However, the timing of reporting large per occurrence excess property losses or property catastrophe losses may not vary significantly from primary insurance.
Under contracts where periodic premium and claims reports are required from ceding companies, such reports are generally required at quarterly intervals which in the U.S. range from 30 to 90 days after the end of the accounting period. Outside the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices vary. In certain countries clients report annually, often 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. The different client reporting practices generally do not result in a significant increase in risk or uncertainty as the actuarial reserving methodologies are adjusted to compensate for the delays.
Premium and loss data is provided to us through at least one intermediary (the primary insurer), so there is a risk that the loss data provided is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. Information provided by ceding companies is reviewed for completeness and compliance with the contract terms. Reinsurance contracts generally allow us to have access to the cedants books and records with respect to the subject business and provide us the ability to conduct audits to determine the accuracy and completeness of information. Audits are conducted as we deem them appropriate.
In the normal course of business, disputes with clients occasionally arise concerning whether certain claims are covered under our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through the involvement of our claims department personnel and the appropriate client personnel or by independent outside counsel. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally specify whether arbitration, litigation, or alternative dispute resolution will be invoked. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
In summary, the scope, number and potential variability of assumptions required in estimating ultimate losses from reinsurance contracts are more uncertain than primary property and casualty insurance due to the factors previously discussed.

The discussion that follows describes our process of establishing loss reserve estimates at General Re. Our loss reserve estimation process is based upon a ground-up approach, beginning with case estimates and supplemented by additional case reserves (ACRs) and IBNR reserves. Critical judgments in establishing loss reserves involve the establishment of ACRs by claim examiners, the expectation of ultimate loss ratios which drive IBNR reserve amounts and comparison of case reserve reporting trends to the expected loss reporting patterns. Recorded reserve amounts are subject to tail risk where reported losses develop beyond the maximum expected loss emergence pattern time period.
We do not routinely determine loss reserve ranges because we believe that the techniques necessary to make such determinations have not sufficiently developed and that the myriad of assumptions required render such resulting ranges to be unreliable. In addition, counts of claims or average amounts per claim are not utilized because clients do not consistently provide reliable data in sufficient detail.
Upon notification of a reinsurance claim from a ceding company, our claim examiners make independent evaluations of loss amounts. In some cases, examiners estimates differ from amounts reported by ceding companies. If the examiners estimates are significantly greater than the ceding companys estimates, the claims are further investigated. If deemed appropriate, ACRs are established above the amount reported by the ceding company. As of December31, 2010, ACRs aggregated approximately $2.7billion before discounts and were concentrated in workers compensation reserves, and to a lesser extent in professional liability reserves. Our examiners also periodically conduct detailed claim reviews of individual clients and case reserves are often increased as a result. In 2010, we conducted 314 claim reviews.
Our actuaries classify all loss and premium data into segments (reserve cells) primarily based on product (e.g., treaty, facultative and program) and line of business (e.g., auto liability, property, etc.). For each reserve cell, premiums and losses are aggregated by accident year, policy year or underwriting year (depending on client reporting practices) and analyzed over time. We internally refer to these loss aggregations as loss triangles, which serve as the primary basis for our IBNR reserve calculations. We review over 300 reserve cells for our North American business and approximately 900 reserve cells with respect to our international business.
We use loss triangles to determine the expected case loss emergence patterns for most coverages and, in conjunction with expected loss ratios by accident year, loss triangles are further used to determine IBNR reserves. While additional calculations form the basis for estimating the expected loss emergence pattern, the determination of the expected loss emergence pattern is not strictly a mechanical process. In instances where the historical loss data is insufficient, we use estimation formulas along with reliance on other loss triangles and judgment. Factors affecting our loss development triangles include but are not limited to the following: changes in client claims practices, changes in claim examiners use of ACRs or the frequency of client company claim reviews, changes in policy terms and coverage (such as client loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate 50 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) policy limits), changes in loss trends and changes in legal trends that result in unanticipated losses, as well as other sources of statistical variability. Collectively, these factors influence the selection of the expected loss emergence patterns.
We select expected loss ratios by reserve cell, by accident year, based upon reviewing forecasted losses and indicated ultimate loss ratios that are predicted from aggregated pricing statistics. Indicated ultimate loss ratios are calculated using the selected loss emergence pattern, reported losses and earned premium. If the selected emergence pattern is not accurate, then the indicated ultimate loss ratios may not be accurate, which can affect the selected loss ratios and hence the IBNR reserve. As with selected loss emergence patterns, selecting expected loss ratios is not a strictly mechanical process and judgment is used in the analysis of indicated ultimate loss ratios and department pricing loss ratios.
We estimate IBNR reserves by reserve cell, by accident year, using the expected loss emergence patterns and the expected loss ratios. The expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios are the critical IBNR reserving assumptions and are updated annually. Once the annual IBNR reserves are determined, our actuaries calculate expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year. These calculations do not involve new assumptions and use the prior year-end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios. The expected losses are then allocated into interim estimates that are compared to actual reported losses in the subsequent year. This comparison provides a test of the adequacy of prior year-end IBNR reserves and forms the basis for possibly changing IBNR reserve assumptions during the course of the year.
In 2010, for prior years workers compensation losses, our reported claims were less than expected claims by $148million. However, further analysis of the workers compensation reserve cells by segment indicated the need for additional IBNR. These developments precipitated $123million of a net increase in nominal IBNR reserve estimates for unreported occurrences. After deducting $123million for the change in net reserve discounts during the year, the net increase in workers compensation losses from prior years occurrences reduced pre-tax earnings in 2010 by $98million. To illustrate the sensitivity of changes in expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios for our significant excess-of-loss workers compensation reserve cells, an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves of approximately $723million and $377million on a discounted basis as of December31, 2010. The increase in discounted reserves would produce a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates.
Our other casualty and general liability reported losses (excluding mass tort losses) developed downwards in 2010 relative to expectations. Casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a given year means that loss reserve amounts currently established will continue to develop favorably. For our significant other casualty and general liability reserve cells (including medical malpractice, umbrella, auto and general liability), an increase of five points in the tails of the expected emergence patterns and an increase of five percent in expected loss ratios (one percent for large international proportional reserve cells) would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $902million. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates in any of the individual aforementioned reserve cells. However, given the diversification in worldwide business, more likely outcomes are believed to be less than $902million.
Our property losses were lower than expected in 2010 but the nature of property loss experience tends to be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophes and large individual property losses. In response to favorable claim developments and another year of information, estimated remaining World Trade Center losses were reduced by $17million.
In certain reserve cells within excess directors and officers and errors and omissions (D&O and E&O) coverages, IBNR reserves are based on estimated ultimate losses without consideration of expected emergence patterns. These cells often involve a spike in loss activity arising from recent industry developments making it difficult to select an expected loss emergence pattern. For our large D&O and E&O reserve cells an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern (for those cells where emergence patterns are considered) and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $190million. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates.
51 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) General Re (Continued) Overall industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability, such as in setting the estimates for mass tort, asbestos and hazardous waste (collectively, mass tort) claims. Unpaid mass tort reserves at December31, 2010 and 2009 were approximately $1.7billion gross and $1.3billion net of reinsurance. Mass tort net claims paid were about $89million in 2010. In 2010, ultimate loss estimates for asbestos and environmental claims were increased by $70million. In addition to the previously described methodologies, we consider survival ratios based on net claim payments in recent years versus net unpaid losses as a rough guide to reserve adequacy. The survival ratio based on claim payments made over the last three years was approximately 14 years as of December31, 2010. The reinsurance industrys comparable survival ratio for asbestos and pollution reserves was approximately 10 years. Estimating mass tort losses is very difficult due to the changing legal environment. Although such reserves are believed to be adequate, significant reserve increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge.
BHRG BHRGs unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December31, 2010 are summarized as follows. Amounts are inmillions.
Property Casualty Total Reported case reserves $ 1,456 $ 2,791 $ 4,247 IBNR reserves 2,253 3,904 6,157 Retroactive  18,720 18,720 Gross reserves $ 3,709 $ 25,415 29,124 Deferred charges and ceded reserves (4,702 ) Net reserves $ 24,422 In general, the methodologies we use to establish loss reserves vary widely and encompass many of the common methodologies employed in the actuarial field today. Certain traditional methodologies such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques are utilized as well as ground-up techniques where appropriate. Additional judgments must also be employed to consider changes in contract conditions and terms as well as the incidence of litigation or legal and regulatory change.
As of December31, 2010, our gross loss reserves related to retroactive reinsurance policies were predominately for casualty or liability losses. Our retroactive policies include excess-of-loss contracts, in which losses (relating to loss events occurring before a specified date on or before the contract date) above a contractual retention are indemnified or contracts that indemnify all losses paid by the counterparty after the policy effective date. We paid retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses of approximately $1.8billion in 2010. The classification reported case reserves has no practical analytical value with respect to retroactive policies since the amount is often derived from reports in bulk from ceding companies, who may have inconsistent definitions of case reserves. We review and establish loss reserve estimates, including estimates of IBNR reserves, in the aggregate by contract.
In establishing retroactive reinsurance reserves, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses into the future under various scenarios. The claim-tail is expected to be very long for many policies and may last several decades. We assign judgmental probability factors to these aggregate loss payment scenarios and an expectancy outcome is determined. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. Since the claim-tail is expected to be very long for such contracts, we reassess expected ultimate losses as significant events related to the underlying losses are reported or revealed during the monitoring and review process. During 2010, retroactive reserves developed downward by $191million.
BHRGs liabilities for environmental, asbestos and latent injury losses and loss adjustment expenses were approximately $10.7billion at December31, 2010 and $9.1billion at December31, 2009 and were concentrated within retroactive reinsurance 52 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) BHRG (Continued) contracts. We paid losses in 2010 attributable to these exposures of approximately $800million. BHRG, as a reinsurer, does not regularly receive reliable information regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies on a consistent basis, particularly with respect to multi-line treaty or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. Periodically, we conduct a ground-up analysis of the underlying loss data of the reinsured to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, our estimates can only be developed by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily include the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which these claims will be adjudicated. Potential legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on establishing loss reserves for mass tort claims in the future.
The maximum losses payable under our retroactive policies is not expected to exceed approximately $32billion as of December31, 2010. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we currently believe it unlikely that gross unpaid losses as of December31, 2010 ($18.7billion) will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than15%.
A significant number of our reinsurance contracts are expected to have a low frequency of claim occurrence combined with a potential for high severity of claims. These include property losses from catastrophes, terrorism and aviation risks under catastrophe and individual risk contracts. Loss reserves related to catastrophe and individual risk contracts were approximately $1.3billion at December31, 2010, an increase of about $200million from December31, 2009. Loss reserves for prior years events declined by approximately $190million in 2010, which produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings. Reserving techniques for catastrophe and individual risk contracts generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. Catastrophe loss reserves are provided when it is probable that an insured loss has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Absent litigation affecting the interpretation of coverage terms, the expected claim-tail is relatively short and thus the estimation error in the initial reserve estimates usually emerges within 24 months after the loss event.
Other reinsurance reserve amounts are generally based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR reserves that are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on an individual contract basis, supplemented by managements judgment of the impact on each contract of major catastrophe events as they become known. Anticipated loss ratios are based upon managements judgment considering the type of business covered, analysis of each ceding companys loss history and evaluation of that portion of the underlying contracts underwritten by each ceding company, which are in turn ceded to BHRG. A range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared.
Derivative contract liabilities Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include significant amounts of derivative contract liabilities that are measured at fair value. Our significant derivative contract exposures are concentrated in credit default and equity index put option contracts. These contracts were primarily entered into in over-the-counter markets and certain elements in the terms and conditions of such contracts are not standardized and are highly illiquid. In particular, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. Furthermore, there is no source of independent data available to us showing trading volume and actual prices of completed transactions. As a result, the values of these liabilities are primarily based on valuation models, discounted cash flow models or other valuation techniques that are believed to be used by market participants. Such models or other valuation techniques may use inputs that are observable in the marketplace, while others are unobservable. Unobservable inputs require us to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in establishing prices. Considerable judgment may be required in making assumptions, including the selection of interest rates, default and recovery rates and volatility. Changes in assumptions may have a significant effect on values. For these reasons, we classify our credit default and equity index put option contracts using Level 3 measurements under GAAP.
The fair values of our high yield credit default contracts are primarily based on indications of bid/ask pricing data. The bid/ask data represents non-binding indications of prices for which similar contracts would be exchanged. Pricing data for the high yield index contracts is obtained from one to three sources depending on the particular index. For the single name and municipal issuer credit default contracts, our fair values are generally based on credit default spread information obtained from a widely 53 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) Derivative contract liabilities (Continued) used reporting source. We monitor and review pricing data for consistency as well as reasonableness with respect to current market conditions. We generally base estimated fair values on the ask prices (the average of such prices if more than one indication is obtained). We make no significant adjustments to the pricing data referred to above. Further, we make no significant adjustments to fair values for non-performance risk. We concluded that the values produced from this data (without adjustment) reasonably represented the values for which we could have transferred these liabilities. However, our contract terms (particularly the lack of collateral posting requirements) likely preclude any transfer of the contracts to third parties. Accordingly, prices in a current actual settlement or transfer could differ significantly from the fair values used in the financial statements. We do not operate as a derivatives dealer and currently we do not utilize offsetting strategies to hedge these contracts. We intend to allow our credit default contracts to run off to their respective expiration dates.
We determine the estimated fair value of equity index put option contracts based on the widely used Black-Scholes option valuation model. Inputs to the model include the current index value, strike price, discount rate, dividend rate and contract expiration date. The weighted average discount and dividend rates used as of December31, 2010 were 3.7% and 2.9%, respectively, and were approximately 4.0% and 2.7%, respectively, as of December31, 2009. The discount rates asofDecember31, 2010 and 2009 were approximately 82 basis points and 55 basis points (on a weighted average basis), respectively, over benchmark interest rates and represented an estimate of the spread between our borrowing rates and thebenchmark rates for comparable durations. The spread adjustments were based on spreads for our obligations and obligations for comparably rated issuers. We believe the most significant economic risks relate to changes in the index value component and to a lesser degree to the foreign currency component. For additional information, see our Market Risk Disclosures.
The Black-Scholes model also incorporates volatility estimates that measure potential price changes over time. The weighted average volatility used as of December31, 2010 was approximately 21.5%, which was relatively unchanged from year end 2009. The weighted average volatilities are based on the volatility input for each equity index put option contract weighted by the notional value of each equity index put option contract as compared to the aggregate notional value of all equity index put option contracts. The volatility input for each equity index put option contract is based upon the implied volatility at the inception of each equity index put option contract. The impact on fair value as of December31, 2010 ($6.7billion) from changes in volatility is summarized below. The values of contracts in an actual exchange are affected by market conditions and perceptions of the buyers and sellers. Actual values in an exchange may differ significantly from the values produced by any mathematical model. Dollars are inmillions.
Hypothetical change in volatility (percentage points) Hypotheticalfairvalue Increase 2 percentage points $ 7,221 Increase 4 percentage points 7,732 Decrease 2 percentage points 6,208 Decrease 4 percentage points 5,711 Other Critical Accounting Policies We record deferred charges with respect to liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts. At the inception of these contracts, the deferred charges represent the difference between the consideration received and the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses. Deferred charges are amortized using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period with the periodic amortization reflected in earnings as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. Deferred charge balances are adjusted periodically to reflect new projections of the amount and timing of loss payments. Adjustments to these assumptions are applied retrospectively from the inception of the contract. Unamortized deferred charges were approximately $3.8billion at December31, 2010. Significant changes in the estimated amount and payment timing of unpaid losses may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization.
Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December31, 2010 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $49.0billion, which includes $14.8billion arising from our acquisition of BNSF in February 2010. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and conducted our most recent annual review in the fourth quarter of 2010. Such tests include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units. There are several methods of estimating a reporting units fair value, 54 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) Other Critical Accounting Policies (Continued) including market quotations, underlying asset and liability fair value determinations and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may involve forecasting revenues and expenses, operating cash flows and capital expenditures as well as an appropriate discount rate. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and performing goodwill impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual future results may vary significantly from the forecasts. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then individual assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of net assets would establish the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is then charged to earnings as an impairment loss.
Market Risk Disclosures Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities.
Interest Rate Risk We regularly invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire securities that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk. Management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur with respect to assets. We strive to maintain high credit ratings so that the cost of debt is minimized. We utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks on a limited basis.
The fair values of our fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. The fair values of fixed interest rate investments may be more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate investments.
55 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) Interest Rate Risk (Continued) The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk, and that no other significant factors change that determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are inmillions.

Equity Price Risk Historically, we have maintained large amounts of invested assets in exchange traded equity securities. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics, with able and honest management and at sensible prices and prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Consequently, equity investments may be concentrated in relatively few investees. At December31, 2010, approximately 58% of the total fair value of equity investments was concentrated in four investees.
We prefer to hold equity investments for very long periods of time so we are not troubled by short-term price volatility with respect to our investments provided that the underlying business, economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. We strive to maintain above average levels of shareholder capital to provide a margin of safety against short-term equity price volatility.
Market prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions.
We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. While our ultimate potential loss with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date, the change in fair value resulting from current changes in the index values are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contract. These contracts expire between 2018 and 2026 and may not be unilaterally settled before their respective expiration dates.
56 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) Equity Price Risk (Continued) The following table summarizes our equity investments and derivative contract liabilities with equity price risk as of December31, 2010 and 2009. The effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates is also shown. The selected 30% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios.

Excludes investments accounted for under the equity method.
Foreign Currency Risk We generally do not use derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency price changes primarily because of the natural hedging that occurs between assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial statements of subsidiaries that do not use the U.S.Dollar as their functional currency are translated into U.S. Dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are included in earnings primarily as a result of the translation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities held by our U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, we hold investments in major multinational companies that have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own, such as The Coca-Cola Company.
Our net assets subject to translation are primarily in our insurance and utilities and energy businesses, and to a lesser extent in our manufacturing and services businesses. The translation impact is somewhat offset by transaction gains or losses on net reinsurance liabilities of certain U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies as well as the equity index put option liabilities of U.S. subsidiaries relating to contracts that would be settled in foreign currencies.
Commodity Price Risk Through our ownership of MidAmerican, we are subject to commodity price risk. Exposures include variations in the price of fuel to generate electricity, wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold and natural gas supply for customers. Commodity prices are subject to wide price swings as supply and demand are impacted by, among many other unpredictable items, weather, market liquidity, generating facility availability, customer usage, storage and transmission and transportation constraints. To mitigate a portion of the risk, MidAmerican uses derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production generally at fixed prices. The settled cost of these contracts is generally recovered from customers in regulated rates. Accordingly, net unrealized gains and losses associated with interim price movements on such contracts are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Financial results would be negatively 57 Table of Contents Managements Discussion (Continued) Commodity Price Risk (Continued) impacted if the costs of wholesale electricity, fuel or natural gas are higher than what is permitted to be recovered in rates. MidAmerican also uses futures, options and swap agreements to economically hedge gas and electric commodity prices for physical delivery to non-regulated customers. MidAmerican does not engage in a material amount of proprietary trading activities.
The table that follows summarizes our commodity price risk on energy derivative contracts of MidAmerican as of December31, 2010 and 2009 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10% increase and a 10% decrease in forward market prices by the expected volumes for these contracts as of each date.

Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2010.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010 has been audited by Deloitte& Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on the following page.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
Omaha, Nebraska We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, cash flows and changes in shareholders equity and comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2010. We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December31, 2010 (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (a) Nature of operations and basis of consolidation Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (Berkshire) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities, including property and casualty insurance and reinsurance, railroad, utilities and energy, finance, manufacturing, service and retailing. In these notes the terms us, we, or our refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Further information regarding our reportable business segments is contained in Note 21. Significant business acquisitions completed over the past three years are discussed in Note 2.
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire consolidated with the accounts of all subsidiaries and affiliates in which we hold a controlling financial interest as of the financial statement date. Normally a controlling financial interest reflects ownership of a majority of the voting interests. We consolidate a variable interest entity (VIE) when we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and we are either obligated to absorb the losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE or we hold the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts in prior year presentations have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.
(b) Use of estimates in preparation of financial statements The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. In particular, estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and related recoverables under reinsurance for property and casualty insurance are subject to considerable estimation error due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim amounts that will be settled over many years. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with the amortization of deferred charges reinsurance assumed, determinations of fair values of certain financial instruments and evaluations of goodwill for impairment require considerable judgment. Actual results may differ from the estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements.
(c) Cash and cash equivalents Cash equivalents consist of funds invested in U.S. Treasury Bills, money market accounts, demand deposits and other investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased.
(d) Investments We determine the appropriate classification of investments in fixed maturity and equity securities at the acquisition date and re-evaluate the classification at each balance sheet date. Held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortized cost, reflecting the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity. Trading investments are carried at fair value and include securities acquired with the intent to sell in the near term. All other securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
We utilize the equity method of accounting with respect to investments when we possess the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when an investor possesses more than 20% of the voting interests of the investee. This presumption may be overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is restricted. We apply the equity method to investments in common stock and to other investments when such other investments possess substantially identical subordinated interests to common stock. In applying the equity method with respect to investments previously accounted for at cost or fair value, the carrying value of the investment is adjusted on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been applied from the time the investment was first acquired.
65 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (d) Investments (Continued) In applying the equity method, we record our investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income of the investee. We record dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the investment. In the event that net losses of the investee reduce the carrying amount to zero, additional net losses may be recorded if other investments in the investee are at-risk even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee. Such additional equity method losses, if any, are based upon the change in our claim on the investees book value.
Investment gains and losses arise when investments are sold (as determined on a specific identification basis) or are other-than-temporarily impaired. If a decline in the value of an investment below cost is deemed other than temporary, the cost of the investment is written down to fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings. Factors considered in judging whether an impairment is other than temporary include: the financial condition, business prospects and creditworthiness of the issuer, the relative amount of the decline, our ability and intent to hold the investment until the fair value recovers and the length of time that fair value has been less than cost. With respect to an investment in a debt security, we recognize an other-than-temporary impairment if we (a)intend to sell or expect to be required to sell before amortized cost is recovered or (b)do not expect to ultimately recover the amortized cost basis even if we do not intend to sell the security. We recognize losses under (a)in earnings and under (b)we recognize the credit loss component in earnings and the difference between fair value and the amortized cost basis net of the credit loss in other comprehensive income.
(e) Receivables, loans and finance receivables Trade, premium and other receivables of the insurance and other businesses are stated at the outstanding principal amounts, net of estimated allowances for uncollectible balances. Allowances for uncollectible balances are provided when as of the balance sheet date it is probable counterparties will be unable to pay all amounts due based on the contractual terms and the loss amounts can be reasonably estimated. Receivables are generally written off against allowances after all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted.
Loans and finance receivables consist of consumer loans (primarily manufactured housing and other real estate loans) and commercial loans originated or purchased. Loans and finance receivables are stated at amortized cost based on our ability and intent to hold such loans and receivables to maturity and are stated net of allowances for uncollectible accounts. Amortized cost represents acquisition cost, plus or minus origination and commitment costs paid or fees received, which together with acquisition premiums or discounts, are deferred and amortized as yield adjustments over the life of the loan. Loans and finance receivables include loan securitizations issued when we have the power to direct and the right to receive residual returns. Substantially all of our consumer loans are secured by real or personal property.
Allowances for credit losses from manufactured housing and other real estate loans include estimates of losses on loans currently in foreclosure and losses on loans not currently in foreclosure. Estimates of losses on loans in foreclosure are based on historical experience and collateral recovery rates. Estimates of losses on loans not currently in foreclosure consider historical default, collateral recovery rates and existing economic conditions. Allowances for credit losses also incorporate the historical average time elapsed from the last payment until foreclosure.
Loans in which payments are delinquent (with no grace period) are considered past due. Loans which are over 90 days past due, in foreclosure, or where borrowers are in bankruptcy, are placed on nonaccrual status and interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed. Subsequent amounts received on the loans are first applied to the principal and interest owed for the most delinquent amount. Interest income accruals are resumed once a loan is less than 90 days delinquent.
Loans in the foreclosure process are considered non-performing. Once a loan is in foreclosure, interest income is not recognized unless the foreclosure is cured or the loan is modified. Once a modification is complete, interest income is recognized based on the terms of the new loan. Loans that have gone through foreclosure are charged off when the collateral is sold. Loans not in foreclosure are evaluated for charge off based on individual circumstances that indicate future collectability of the loan, including the condition of the collateral securing the loan.
66 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (f) Derivatives We carry derivative contracts at estimated fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such balances reflect reductions permitted under master netting agreements with counterparties. The changes in fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes are recorded in earnings as derivative gains/losses.
Cash collateral received from or paid to counterparties to secure derivative contract assets or liabilities is included in other liabilities or assets. Securities received from counterparties as collateral are not recorded as assets and securities delivered to counterparties as collateral continue to be reflected as assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
(g) Fair value measurements As defined under GAAP, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between market participants in the principal market or in the most advantageous market when no principal market exists. Adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market prices may be required in illiquid or disorderly markets in order to estimate fair value. Different valuation techniques may be appropriate under the circumstances to determine the value that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction. Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, able and willing to transact an exchange and not under duress. Nonperformance or credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of liabilities. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange.
(h) Inventories Inventories consist of manufactured goods and goods acquired for resale. Manufactured inventory costs include raw materials, direct and indirect labor and factory overhead. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. As of December31, 2010, approximately 39% of the total inventory cost was determined using the last-in-first-out (LIFO) method, 32% using the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method, with the remainder using the specific identification method or average cost methods. With respect to inventories carried at LIFO cost, the aggregate difference in value between LIFO cost and cost determined under FIFO methods was $637million and $575million as of December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
(i) Property, plant and equipment Additions to property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. The cost of major additions and betterments are capitalized, while the cost of replacements, maintenance and repairs, that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the related assets are expensed as incurred. Interest over the construction period is capitalized as a component of cost of constructed assets. The cost of constructed assets of certain of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries that are subject to ASC 980 Regulated Operations also includes an equity allowance for funds used during construction. Also see Note1(p).
Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Depreciation of assets of regulated utility and energy subsidiaries is provided over recovery periods based on composite asset class lives. Railroad properties are depreciated using the group method in which a single depreciation rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class.
We evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or the assets are being held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, we review the asset to assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset plus residual value from the ultimate disposal exceeds the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, we write down the asset to the estimated fair value. Impairment losses are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, except with respect to impairments of assets of certain domestic regulated utility and energy subsidiaries where impairment losses are offset by the establishment of a regulatory asset to the extent recovery in future rates is probable.
67 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (i) Property, plant and equipment (Continued) Our railroad business is very capital intensive and its large base of homogenous, network-type assets turns over on a continuous basis. Each year, a capital program is developed for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets to enhance the efficiency of operations, gain strategic benefit or provide new service offerings to customers. Assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria. Normal repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred, while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset, improve the safety of our operations, or improve operating efficiency are capitalized. Rail grinding costs are expensed as incurred.
(j) Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business acquisitions. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. Evaluating goodwill for impairment involves a two-step process. The first step is to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. There are several methods that may be used to estimate a reporting units fair value, including market quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, including, but not limited to, discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, a second step is performed. Under the second step, the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value as of the current testing date. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the current estimated fair value of net assets establishes the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded goodwill over the implied goodwill value is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and performing goodwill impairment tests.
(k) Revenue recognition Insurance premiums for prospective property/casualty and health insurance and reinsurance are earned over the loss exposure or coverage period, in proportion to the level of protection provided. In most cases, premiums are recognized as revenues ratably over the term of the contract with unearned premiums computed on a monthly or daily pro rata basis. Premiums for retroactive reinsurance property/casualty policies are earned at the inception of the contracts, as all of the underlying loss events covered by these policies occurred in the past. Premiums for life reinsurance contracts are earned when due. Premiums earned are stated net of amounts ceded to reinsurers. Premiums are estimated with respect to certain reinsurance contracts where reports from ceding companies for the period are not contractually due until after the balance sheet date. For contracts containing experience rating provisions, premiums are based upon estimated loss experience under the contract.
Sales revenues derive from the sales of manufactured products and goods acquired for resale. Revenues from sales are recognized upon passage of title to the customer, which generally coincides with customer pickup, product delivery or acceptance, depending on terms of the sales arrangement.
Service revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Services provided pursuant to a contract are either recognized over the contract period or upon completion of the elements specified in the contract depending on the terms of the contract. Revenues related to the sales of fractional ownership interests in aircraft are recognized ratably over the term of the related management services agreement as the transfer of ownership interest in the aircraft is inseparable from the management services agreement.
Interest income from investments in fixed maturity securities and loans is earned under the constant yield method and includes accrual of interest due under terms of the agreement as well as amortization of acquisition premiums, accruable discounts and capitalized loan origination fees, as applicable. In determining the constant yield for mortgage-backed securities, anticipated counterparty prepayments are estimated and evaluated periodically. Dividends from equity securities are recognized when earned, which is on the ex-dividend date or the declaration date, when there is no ex-dividend date.
Operating revenue of utilities and energy businesses resulting from the distribution and sale of natural gas and electricity to customers is recognized when the service is rendered or the energy is delivered. Amounts recognized include unbilled as well as billed amounts. Rates charged are generally subject to federal and state regulation or established under contractual arrangements. When preliminary rates are permitted to be billed prior to final approval by the applicable regulator, certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimated refunds is accrued.
68 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (k) Revenue recognition (Continued) Railroad transportation revenues are recognized based upon the proportion of service provided as of the balance sheet date. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping to/from specific locations, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on a pro-rata basis based on actual or projected future customer shipments. When using projected shipments, we rely on historic trends as well as economic and other indicators to estimate the liability for customer incentives.
(l) Losses and loss adjustment expenses Liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represent estimated claim and claim settlement costs of property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts issued by our insurance subsidiaries with respect to losses that have occurred as of the balance sheet date. The liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses are recorded at the estimated ultimate payment amounts, except that amounts arising from certain workers compensation reinsurance business are discounted as discussed below. Estimated ultimate payment amounts are based upon (1)individual case estimates, (2)reports of losses from policyholders and (3)estimates of incurred but not reported losses.
Provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses are charged to earnings after deducting amounts recovered and estimates of amounts ceded under reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect to the underlying insurance and reinsurance contracts.
The estimated liabilities of workers compensation claims assumed under certain reinsurance contracts are carried at discounted amounts. Discounted amounts are based upon an annual discount rate of 4.5% for claims arising prior to January1, 2003 and 1% for claims arising thereafter, consistent with discount rates used under insurance statutory accounting principles. The change in such reserve discounts, including the periodic discount accretion is included in earnings as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses.
(m) Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Estimated liabilities for claims and claim costs in excess of the consideration received with respect to retroactive property and casualty reinsurance contracts that provide for indemnification of insurance risk are established as deferred charges at inception of such contracts. Deferred charges are subsequently amortized using the interest method over the expected claim settlement periods. Changes to the estimated timing or amount of loss payments produce changes in periodic amortization. Changes in such estimates are applied retrospectively and are included in insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. The unamortized balances of deferred charges reinsurance assumed were $3,810million and $3,957million at December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
(n) Insurance premium acquisition costs Costs that vary with and are related to the issuance of insurance policies are deferred, subject to ultimate recoverability, and are charged to underwriting expenses as the related premiums are earned. Acquisition costs consist of commissions, premium taxes, advertising and certain other costs. The recoverability of premium acquisition costs generally reflects anticipation of investment income. The unamortized balances of deferred premium acquisition costs are included in other assets and were $1,768million and $1,770million at December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
(p) Regulated utilities and energy businesses Certain domestic energy subsidiaries prepare their financial statements in accordance with ASC 980 Regulated Operations, reflecting the economic effects from the ability to recover certain costs from customers and the requirement to return revenues to customers in the future through the regulated rate-setting process. Accordingly, certain costs are deferred as regulatory assets and obligations are accrued as regulatory liabilities which will be amortized over various future periods. At December31, 2010, the Consolidated Balance Sheet includes $2,497million in regulatory assets and $1,664million in regulatory liabilities. At December31, 2009, the Consolidated Balance Sheet includes $2,093million in regulatory assets and $1,603million in regulatory liabilities. Regulatory assets and liabilities are components of other assets and other liabilities of utilities and energy businesses.
69 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (p) Regulated utilities and energy businesses (Continued) Regulatory assets and liabilities are continually assessed for probable future inclusion in regulatory rates by considering factors such as applicable regulatory or legislative changes and recent rate orders received by other regulated entities. If future inclusion in regulatory rates ceases to be probable, the amount no longer probable of inclusion in regulatory rates is charged to earnings or reflected as an adjustment to rates.
(q) Life, annuity and health insurance benefits The liability for insurance benefits under life contracts has been computed based upon estimated future investment yields, expected mortality, morbidity, and lapse or withdrawal rates and reflect estimates for future premiums and expenses under the contracts. These assumptions, as applicable, also include a margin for adverse deviation and may vary with the characteristics of the reinsurance contracts date of issuance, policy duration and country of risk. The interest rate assumptions used may vary by reinsurance contract or jurisdiction and generally range from approximately 3% to 6%. Annuity contracts are discounted based on the implicit rate of return as of the inception of the contracts and such interest rates range from approximately 1% to 7%.
(r) Foreign currency The accounts of our non-U.S. based subsidiaries are measured in most instances using the local currency of the subsidiary as the functional currency. Revenues and expenses of these businesses are generally translated into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rate for the period. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate as of the end of the reporting period. Gains or losses from translating the financial statements of foreign-based operations are included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity that is party to the transaction are included in earnings.
(s) Income taxes We file a consolidated federal income tax return in the United States, which includes our eligible subsidiaries. In addition, we file income tax returns in state, local and foreign jurisdictions as applicable. Provisions for current income tax liabilities are calculated and accrued on income and expense amounts expected to be included in the income tax returns for the current year.
Deferred income taxes are calculated under the liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities that are associated with components of other comprehensive income are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income. Otherwise, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as a component of income tax expense. Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to changes in enacted tax rates are charged or credited to income tax expense in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances are established for certain deferred tax assets where realization is not likely.
Assets and liabilities are established for uncertain tax positions taken or positions expected to be taken in income tax returns when such positions are judged to not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold based on the technical merits of the positions. Estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are generally included as a component of income tax expense.
(t) New accounting pronouncements We adopted FASB Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) 2009-16 and ASU 2009-17 as of January1, 2010. ASU 2009-16 eliminated the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity (QSPE) and the exemption of QSPEs from previous consolidation guidance and also modified the criteria for derecognizing financial assets by transferors. ASU 2009-17 amended the standards related to consolidation of variable interest entities. ASU 2009-17 included new criteria for determining the primary beneficiary of VIEs and increased the frequency in which reassessments must be made to determine the primary beneficiary of VIEs. The guidance in these standards is applied prospectively except that upon the adoption of ASU 2009-17 we reevaluated VIEs for purposes of determining whether or not those entities should be included in our Consolidated Financial Statements based on the new guidance. See Notes 7 and 14 for information concerning the most significant impact of adopting these pronouncements.
70 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (t) New accounting pronouncements (Continued) In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, Improving Disclosures About Fair Value Measurements. ASU 2010-06 requires the separate disclosure of significant transfers into and out of the Level 1 and Level 2 categories; requires fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities; and requires disclosures about valuation techniques and inputs used in Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements. These disclosure requirements became effective at the beginning of 2010. In addition, effective in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2010, ASU 2010-06 also requires Level 3 disclosures of activity on a gross rather than a net basis. We do not anticipate that the remaining disclosures under ASU 2010-06 will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In July 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-20, Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses. ASU 2010-20 requires increased disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and allowances for credit losses, including disclosure about credit quality indicators, past due information and modifications of finance receivables. The guidance regarding end of period reporting is effective for reporting periods ending after December15, 2010, while guidance about activity during the reporting period is effective for reporting periods beginning after December15, 2010, except for guidance regarding loan modifications, which has been delayed. We do not anticipate that the adoption of ASU 2010-20 will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In October 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-26, Accounting for Costs Associated with Acquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts. ASU 2010-26 modifies the types of costs incurred by insurance entities that are deferred in the acquiring or renewing of insurance contracts. ASU 2010-26 requires that only direct incremental costs related to successful efforts are capitalized. Capitalized costs may include certain advertising costs which are allowed tobecapitalized if the primary purpose of the advertising is to elicit sales to customers proven to have responded directly to the advertising and the probable future revenues generated from the advertising are proven to be in excess of expected future costs to be incurred in realizing those revenues. ASU 2010-26 is effective for fiscal yearsand interim periods beginning after December15, 2011 and may be applied on a prospective or retrospective basis. We are evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU 2010-26 will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-28, When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts. ASU 2010-28 modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test is required if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, after considering whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist. ASU 2010-28 is effective prospectively for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December15, 2011. We do not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2010-28 will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2) Significant business acquisitions Our long-held acquisition strategy is to purchase businesses with consistent earning power, good returns on equity and able and honest management at sensible prices.
On February12, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation that we did not already own (about 264.5million shares or 77.5%) for aggregate consideration of $26.5billion that consisted of cash of approximately $15.9billion with the remainder in Berkshire common stock (80,931 ClassA shares and 20,976,621 Class B shares). Approximately 50% of the cash component was funded with existing cash balances and the remaining 50% was funded with proceeds from debt issued by Berkshire. The acquisition was completed through the merger of a wholly-owned merger subsidiary (a Delaware limited liability company) and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation. The merger subsidiary was the surviving entity and was renamed Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (BNSF). BNSF is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and through BNSF Railway Company operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America with approximately 32,000 route miles (including 23,000 route miles of track owned by BNSF) of track in 28 states and two Canadian provinces.
71 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (2) Significant business acquisitions (Continued) Prior to February12, 2010, we owned 76.8million shares of BNSF (22.5% of the outstanding shares), which were acquired between August 2006 and January 2009. We accounted for those shares pursuant to the equity method and as of February12, 2010, our investment had a carrying value of $6.6billion. We are accounting for the acquisition of BNSF pursuant to the acquisition method under Accounting Standards Codification Section805 Business Combinations (ASC 805). Upon completion of the acquisition of the remaining BNSF shares, we were required under ASC 805 to re-measure our previously owned investment in BNSF at fair value as of the acquisition date. In the first quarter of 2010, we recognized a one-time holding gain of approximately $1.0billion for the difference between the fair value of the BNSF shares and our carrying value under the equity method.
The allocation of the aggregate $34.5billion purchase price (including the fair value of the previously owned shares of BNSF and the value of certain BNSF outstanding equity awards that were converted into Berkshire Class B equity awards on the acquisition date) to BNSFs assets and liabilities is summarized below (inmillions): Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 971 Property, plant and equipment 43,987 Goodwill 14,803 Other 5,702 $ 65,463 Liabilities and Net assets acquired: Accounts payable and other liabilities $ 6,623 Notes payable and other borrowings 11,142 Income taxes, principally deferred 13,203 30,968 Net assets acquired 34,495 $ 65,463 BNSFs financial statements are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning as of February13, 2010. The following table sets forth certain unaudited pro forma consolidated earnings data for the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009, as if the BNSF acquisition was consummated on the same terms at the beginning of 2010 and 2009. Amounts are inmillions, except earnings per share.
2010 2009 Total revenues $ 138,004 $ 126,745 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders 13,213 9,525 Earnings per equivalent ClassA common share attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders 8,024 5,786 We had no significant business acquisitions in 2009. During 2008, we acquired approximately 64% of the outstanding common stock of Marmon Holdings, Inc. (Marmon), a private company owned by trusts for the benefit of members of the Pritzker Family of Chicago, for approximately $4.8billion in the aggregate. Marmon is an international association of approximately 130 manufacturing and service businesses that operate independently within diverse business sectors. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we will acquire the remaining equity interests in Marmon between 2011 and 2014 for consideration to be based on the earnings of Marmon. We also acquired several other relatively small businesses during 2008. Consideration paid for all businesses acquired in 2008 was approximately $6.1billion.

During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges of $1,020million with respect to certain fixed maturity securities where we concluded that we were unlikely to receive all remaining contractual principal and interest amounts when due. These securities had been in an unrealized loss position for more than two years.
The amortized cost and estimated fair value of securities with fixed maturities at December31, 2010 are summarized below by contractual maturity dates. Actual maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers of certain of the securities retain early call or prepayment rights. Amounts are inmillions.

Unrealized losses of equity investments at December31, 2010 that were in a continuous loss position for more than twelve months and for which other-than-temporary impairment charges were not recorded were $531million, including $384million related to Wells Fargo& Company. As of December 31, 2009, unrealized losses over one year in duration were approximately $2.7 billion, including $832 million related to Wells Fargo & Company. As of December 31, 2010, such losses generally ranged between 3% and 15% of the original cost of the related individual securities. We believe that the impairment of each of the individual securities that have been in an unrealized loss position over twelve months as of December31, 2010 is temporary. Our belief is based on (a) our ability and current intent to hold the securities to recovery; (b) our assessment that the underlying business and financial condition of the issuers improved over the past year and that such conditions are currently favorable; (c)our opinion that the relative price declines are not significant; (d) the fact that the market prices of these issuers have increased over the past year; and (e) our belief that it is reasonably possible that market prices will increase to and exceed our cost in a relatively short period of time. Changes in market conditions and other facts and circumstances may change the business prospects of these issuers as well as our ability and current intent to hold these securities until the prices recover.
During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded other-than-temporary impairment losses of $938million related to certain other equity securities. These securities had been in unrealized loss positions for over two years. The amount of the impairments averaged about 20% of the original cost of each security. Other-than-temporary impairment losses result in a reduction of the cost basis of the investment but not the fair value. Accordingly, such losses that are included in earnings are offset by a corresponding credit to other comprehensive income.

(GS), General Electric Company (GE), Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company (Wrigley), Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd. (Swiss Re) and The Dow Chemical Company (Dow). As of December31, 2009, we also owned 22.5% of BNSFs outstanding common stock, which we accounted for pursuant to the equity method and included in other investments of insurance and other businesses in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Upon acquiring all remaining outstanding shares of BNSF on February12, 2010, we discontinued using the equity method and began consolidating the accounts of BNSF. See Note 2.

The GS Preferred may be redeemed at any time by GS at a price of $110,000 per share ($5.5billion in aggregate). The GS Warrants expire in 2013 and can be exercised for an additional aggregate cost of $5billion ($115/share). In 2008, we also acquired 30,000 shares of 10% Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of GE (GE Preferred) and warrants to purchase 134,831,460 shares of common stock of GE (GE Warrants) for a combined cost of $3billion. The GE Preferred may be redeemed by GE beginning in October 2011 at a price of $110,000 per share ($3.3billion in aggregate). The GE Warrants expire in 2013 and can be exercised for an additional aggregate cost of $3billion ($22.25/share).
We own $4.4billion par amount of 11.45% Wrigley subordinated notes due in 2018 and $2.1billion of 5% Wrigley preferred stock, which we acquired in 2008. In December 2009, we also acquired $1.0billion par amount of Wrigley senior notes due in 2013 and 2014. The Wrigley subordinated and senior notes are classified as held-to-maturity and we carry these investments at cost, adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate changes that apply to certain of the senior notes. We carry the Wrigley preferred stock at fair value classified as available-for-sale.
We own 3,000,000 shares of Series A Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock of Dow (Dow Preferred), which we acquired in 2009 for a cost of $3billion. Under certain conditions, each share of the Dow Preferred is convertible into 24.201 shares of Dow common stock. Beginning in April 2014, if Dows common stock price exceeds $53.72 per share for any 20 trading days in a consecutive 30-day window, Dow, at its option, at any time, in whole or in part, may convert the Dow Preferred into Dow common stock at the then applicable conversion rate. The Dow Preferred is entitled to dividends at a rate of 8.5%per annum.
In 2009, we also acquired a 12% convertible perpetual capital instrument issued by Swiss Re at a cost of $2.7billion. The instrument had a face amount of 3billion Swiss Francs (CHF). The terms of the instrument allowed Swiss Re to redeem at its option the instrument under certain conditions. On November3, 2010, we entered into an agreement with Swiss Re regarding the redemption of the instrument in exchange for aggregate consideration of approximately CHF 3.9billion of which CHF 180million was received on November25, 2010 with the remainder to be paid to us in 2011. As of December31, 2010, the amount due (and subsequently received on January10, 2011) was classified in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as a component of receivables of insurance and other businesses.

See Note 2. The cost of these assets includes the fair value adjustments made as of the acquisition date. The utility generation, distribution and transmission system and interstate pipeline assets are the regulated assets of public utility and natural gas pipeline subsidiaries.
78 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (11) Derivative contracts Derivative contracts are used primarily by our finance and financial products businesses and our railroad, utilities and energy businesses. As of December31, 2010 and 2009, substantially all of the derivative contracts of our finance and financial products businesses are not designated as hedges for financial reporting purposes. These contracts were initially entered into with the expectation that the premiums received would exceed the amounts ultimately paid to counterparties. Changes in the fair values of such contracts are reported in earnings as derivative gains/losses. A summary of derivative contracts of our finance and financial products businesses follows (inmillions).
2010 2009 Assets (3) Liabilities Notional Value Assets (3) Liabilities Notional Value Equity index put options $  $ 6,712 $ 33,891 (1) $  $ 7,309 $ 37,990 (1) Credit default obligations: High yield indexes  159 4,893 (2)  781 5,533 (2) States/municipalities  1,164 16,042 (2)  853 16,042 (2) Individual corporate 84  3,565 (2) 81  3,565 (2) Other 341 375 378 360 Counterparty netting (82 ) (39 ) (193 ) (34 ) $ 343 $ 8,371 $ 266 $ 9,269 (1) Represents the aggregate undiscounted amount payable at the contract expiration dates assuming that the value of each index is zero at the contract expiration date.
(2) Represents the maximum undiscounted future value of losses payable under the contracts. The number of losses required to exhaust contract limits under substantially all of the contracts is dependent on the loss recovery rate related to the specific obligor at the time of a default.
(3) Included in Other assets of finance and financial products businesses.
A summary of derivative gains/losses of our finance and financial products businesses included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings are as follows (inmillions).
2010 2009 2008 Equity index put options $ 172 $ 2,713 $ (5,028 ) Credit default obligations 250 789 (1,774 ) Other (161 ) 122 (19 ) $ 261 $ 3,624 $ (6,821 ) The equity index put option contracts are European style options written on four major equity indexes. Future payments, if any, under these contracts will be required if the underlying index value is below the strike price at the contract expiration dates which occur between June 2018 and January 2026. We received the premiums on these contracts in full at the contract inception dates and therefore we have no counterparty credit risk. During the fourth quarter of 2010, certain of these contracts were unwound at the instigation of our counterparty to these contracts. We had originally received premiums of $647million for these contracts and we paid $425million to unwind the contracts. The notional value of these contracts was approximately $4.3billion.
At December31, 2010, the aggregate intrinsic value (the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are settled on their future expiration dates based on the December31, 2010 index values and foreign currency exchange rates) was approximately $3.8billion. However, these contracts may not be unilaterally terminated or fully settled before the expiration dates and therefore the ultimate amount of cash basis gains or losses on these contracts may not be determined for many years. The remaining weighted average life of all contracts was approximately 10 years at December31, 2010.
Our credit default contracts pertain to various indexes of non-investment grade (or high yield) corporate issuers, state/municipal debt issuers and other individual corporate issuers. These contracts cover the loss in value of specified debt obligations of the issuers arising from default events, which are usually from their failure to make payments or bankruptcy. Loss amounts are subject to aggregate contract limits.
79 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (11) Derivative contracts (Continued) The high yield index contracts are comprised of specified North American corporate issuers (usually 100 in number at inception) whose obligations are rated below investment grade. High yield contracts remaining in-force at December31, 2010 expire from 2011 through 2013. State and municipality contracts are comprised of over 500 state and municipality issuers and had a weighted average contract life at December31, 2010 of approximately 10.1 years. Potential obligations related to approximately 50% of the notional value of the state and municipality contracts cannot be settled before the maturity dates of the underlying obligations, which range from 2019 to 2054.
Premiums on the high yield index and state/municipality contracts are received in full at the inception dates of the contracts and, as a result, we have no counterparty credit risk. Our payment obligations under certain of these contracts are on a first loss basis. Losses under other contracts are subject to aggregate deductibles that must be satisfied before we have any payment obligations.
Individual corporate credit default contracts primarily relate to issuers of investment grade obligations. In most instances, premiums are due from counterparties on a quarterly basis over the terms of the contracts. As of December31, 2010, all of the contracts in-force expire in 2013.
With limited exceptions, our equity index put option and credit default contracts contain no collateral posting requirements with respect to changes in either the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts and/or a downgrade of Berkshires credit ratings. As of December31, 2010, our collateral posting requirement under contracts with collateral provisions was $31million compared to $35million at December31, 2009. As of December31, 2010, had Berkshires credit ratings (currently AA+ from Standard& Poors and Aa2 from Moodys) been downgraded below either A- by Standard& Poors or A3 by Moodys an additional $1.1billion would have been required to be posted as collateral.
Our railroad and regulated utility subsidiaries are exposed to variations in the market prices in the purchases and sales of natural gas and electricity and in commodity fuel costs. Derivative instruments, including forward purchases and sales, futures, swaps and options, are used to manage these price risks. Unrealized gains and losses under the contracts of our regulated utilities that are probable of recovery through rates are recorded as a regulatory net asset or liability. Unrealized gains or losses on contracts accounted for as cash flow or fair value hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or in net earnings, as appropriate. Derivative contract assets included in other assets of railroad, utilities and energy businesses were $231million and $188million as of December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Derivative contract liabilities included in accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities of railroad, utilities and energy businesses were $621million as of December31, 2010 and $581million as of December31, 2009.
(12) Supplemental cash flow information A summary of supplemental cash flow information for each of the three years ending December31, 2010 is presented in the following table (inmillions).
2010 2009 2008 Cash paid during the year for: Income taxes $ 3,547 $ 2,032 $ 3,530 Interest of insurance and other businesses 185 145 197 Interest of railroad, utilities and energy businesses 1,667 1,142 1,172 Interest of finance and financial products businesses 708 615 522 Non-cash investing and financing activities: Liabilities assumed in connection with acquisition of BNSF 30,968   Common stock issued in connection with acquisition of BNSF 10,577   Liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions of other businesses 438 278 4,763 Equity/fixed maturity securities exchanged for other securities/investments   2,329 (13) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses The liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with property and casualty claim occurrences as of the balance sheet dates including estimates for incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims. Considerable judgment is required to evaluate claims and establish estimated claim liabilities.
80 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (13) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued) A reconciliation of the changes in liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of our property/casualty insurance subsidiaries is as follows (inmillions).
2010 2009 2008 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Gross liabilities at beginning of year $ 59,416 $ 56,620 $ 56,002 Ceded losses and deferred charges at beginning of year (6,879 ) (7,133 ) (7,126 ) Net balance at beginning of year 52,537 49,487 48,876 Incurred losses recorded during the year: Current accident year 20,357 19,156 17,399 Prior accident years (2,270 ) (905 ) (1,140 ) Total incurred losses 18,087 18,251 16,259 Payments during the year with respect to: Current accident year (7,666 ) (7,207 ) (6,905 ) Prior accident years (9,191 ) (8,315 ) (8,486 ) Total payments (16,857 ) (15,522 ) (15,391 ) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Net balance at end of year 53,767 52,216 49,744 Ceded losses and deferred charges at end of year 6,545 6,879 7,133 Foreign currency translation adjustment (312 ) 232 (616 ) Acquisitions 75 89 359 Gross liabilities at end of year $ 60,075 $ 59,416 $ 56,620 Incurred losses recorded during the current year but attributable to a prior accident year (prior accident years) reflects the amount of estimation error charged or credited to earnings in each calendar year with respect to the liabilities established as of the beginning of that year. We reduced the beginning of the year net losses and loss adjustment expenses liability by $2,626million in 2010, $1,507million in 2009 and $1,690million in 2008, which excludes the effects of prior years discount accretion and deferred charge amortization referred to below. In each year, the reductions in loss estimates for occurrences in prior years were primarily due to lower than expected severities and frequencies on private passenger and commercial auto claims, lower than expected reported reinsurance losses in both property and casualty lines and lower than expected medical malpractice losses. Accident year loss estimates are regularly adjusted to consider emerging loss development patterns of prior years losses, whether favorable or unfavorable.
Incurred losses for prior accident years also include amortization of deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts incepting prior to the beginning of the year and the accretion of the net discounts recorded on certain workers compensation loss reserves. Amortization charges included in prior accident years losses were $261million in 2010, $504million in 2009 and $451million in 2008. Net discounted workers compensation liabilities at December31, 2010 and 2009 were $2,315million and $2,356million, respectively, reflecting net discounts of $2,269million and $2,473million, respectively. The accretion of discounted liabilities related to prior accident years incurred losses was approximately $95million in 2010, $98million in 2009 and $99million in 2008.
We are exposed to environmental, asbestos and other latent injury claims arising from insurance and reinsurance contracts. Loss reserve estimates for environmental and asbestos exposures include case basis reserves and also reflect reserves for legal and other loss adjustment expenses and IBNR reserves. IBNR reserves are determined based upon our historic general liability exposure base and policy language, previous environmental loss experience and the assessment of current trends of environmental law, environmental cleanup costs, asbestos liability law and judgmental settlements of asbestos liabilities.
The liabilities for environmental, asbestos and latent injury claims and claims expenses net of reinsurance recoverables were approximately $12.4billion at December31, 2010 and $10.6billion at December31, 2009. These liabilities included approximately $10.7billion at December31, 2010 and $9.1billion at December31, 2009 of liabilities assumed under 81 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (13) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued) retroactive reinsurance contracts. Liabilities arising from retroactive contracts with exposure to claims of this nature are generally subject to aggregate policy limits. Thus, our exposure to environmental and latent injury claims under these contracts is, likewise, limited. We monitor evolving case law and its effect on environmental and latent injury claims. Changing government regulations, newly identified toxins, newly reported claims, new theories of liability, new contract interpretations and other factors could result in significant increases in these liabilities. Such development could be material to our results of operations. It is not possible to reliably estimate the amount of additional net loss or the range of net loss that is reasonably possible.
(14) Notes payable and other borrowings Notes payable and other borrowings are summarized below (inmillions). The average interest rates shown in the following tables are the weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt as of December31, 2010.
Average InterestRate 2010 2009 Insurance and other: Issued by Berkshire parent company due 2011-2047 1.5 % $ 8,360 $ 340 Short-term subsidiary borrowings 0.3 % 1,682 1,607 Other subsidiary borrowings due 2011-2036 5.2 % 2,429 2,614 $ 12,471 $ 4,561 In connection with the BNSF acquisition, Berkshire issued $8.0billion aggregate par amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of $2.0billion par amount of floating rate notes due in 2011; $1.1billion par amount of floating rate notes due in 2012; $600million par amount of 1.4% notes due in 2012; $1.2billion par amount of floating rate notes due in 2013; $1.4billion par amount of 2.125% notes due in 2013; and $1.7billion par amount of 3.2% notes due in 2015. The floating rate notes due in 2011 were repaid on February10, 2011.
Average InterestRate 2010 2009 Railroad, utilities and energy: Issued by MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (MidAmerican) and its subsidiaries: MidAmerican senior unsecured debt due 2012-2037 6.1 % $ 5,371 $ 5,371 Subsidiary and other debt due 2011-2039 5.8 % 14,275 14,208 Issued by BNSF due 2011-2097 6.1 % 11,980  $ 31,626 $ 19,579 Berkshire does not guarantee any debt or other borrowings of BNSF, MidAmerican or their subsidiaries. Subsidiary debt represents amounts issued by subsidiaries of MidAmerican pursuant to separate financing agreements. All or substantially all of the assets of certain MidAmerican subsidiaries are or may be pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure the debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants including, but not limited to, leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and debt service coverage ratios. As of December31, 2010, BNSF and MidAmerican and its subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable covenants.
As of the February12, 2010 acquisition date, BNSFs outstanding debt was approximately $11.1billion. During 2010, BNSF issued $750million of 5.75% debentures due in 2040, $250million of 3.60% debentures due in 2020 and $500million of 5.05% debentures due in 2041. BNSFs borrowings are primarily unsecured.
Average InterestRate 2010 2009 Finance and financial products: Issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (BHFC) 4.2 % $ 11,535 $ 12,051 Issued by other subsidiaries due 2011-2036 5.1 % 2,942 1,718 $ 14,477 $ 13,769 82 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (14) Notes payable and other borrowings (Continued) BHFC is a 100% owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, which has fully and unconditionally guaranteed its securities. Debt issued by BHFC matures between 2011 and 2040. During 2010, BHFC issued $750million par amount of 5.75% senior notes due in 2040, $250million par amount of floating rate senior notes due in 2012 and $500million par amount of 2.45% senior notes due in 2015. In 2010, $2.0billion par amount of BHFC senior notes matured and were repaid. In January 2011, BHFC issued an additional $1.5billion par amount of notes and repaid $1.5billion of maturing notes. The new notes are unsecured and are comprised of $750million par amount of 4.25% senior notes due in 2021, $375million par amount of 1.5% senior notes due in 2014 and $375million par amount of floating rate senior notes due in 2014.
Prior to our acquisition of Clayton Homes in 2003, certain of its subsidiaries regularly sold their originated and acquired installment loans to special purpose entities (SPEs). The transferred loans were then securitized and sold to third party investors. We continue to service these installment loans and retain residual interests in the securitized loans. As described in Note 1(t), ASU 2009-16 eliminated the concept of QSPEs and, in accordance with the requirements of ASU 2009-17, we reevaluated the SPEs and determined that the SPEs were variable interest entities that should be consolidated under the new guidance, primarily because we are the servicer of the loans and hold the residual interests. Consequently, as of January1, 2010, we increased other borrowings of finance and financial products by approximately $1.5billion with a corresponding increase in consumer installment loans receivable. The SPEs continue to be distinct, bankruptcy remote entities that hold the interests in the related installment loans. The cash flows received from the collection of the installment loans continue to be pledged to satisfy the principal and interest due on the related debt now recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our subsidiaries have approximately $6.2billion of available unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity in the aggregate at December31, 2010, to support our short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Generally, Berkshires guarantee of a subsidiarys debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all present and future payment obligations.
Principal payments expected during the next five years are as follows (inmillions).
2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Insurance and other $ 3,915 $ 1,880 $ 2,706 $ 118 $ 1,921 Railroad, utilities and energy 2,162 2,097 1,104 1,618 713 Finance and financial products 2,031 2,942 3,658 587 1,658 $ 8,108 $ 6,919 $ 7,468 $ 2,323 $ 4,292 (15) Income taxes The liability for income taxes as of December31, 2010 and 2009 as reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets is as follows (inmillions).
2010 2009 Payable currently $ (211 ) $ (396 ) Deferred 35,558 18,695 Other 1,005 926 $ 36,352 $ 19,225 83 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (15) Income taxes (Continued) The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December31, 2010 and 2009 are shown below (inmillions).

Earnings expected to remain reinvested indefinitely were approximately $4.1billion as of December31, 2010. Upon distribution as dividends or otherwise, such amounts would be subject to taxation in the U.S. as well as foreign countries. However, U.S. income tax liabilities could be offset, in whole or in part, by tax credits allowable from taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions. Determination of the potential net tax due is impracticable due to the complexities of hypothetical calculations involving uncertain timing and amounts of taxable income and the effects of multiple taxing jurisdictions.
The Consolidated Statements of Earnings reflect charges for income taxes as shown below (inmillions).
2010 2009 2008 Federal $ 4,546 $ 2,833 $ 915 State 337 124 249 Foreign 724 581 814 $ 5,607 $ 3,538 $ 1,978 Current $ 3,668 $ 1,619 $ 3,811 Deferred 1,939 1,919 (1,833 ) $ 5,607 $ 3,538 $ 1,978 Charges for income taxes are reconciled to hypothetical amounts computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate in the table shown below (inmillions).
2010 2009 2008 Earnings before income taxes $ 19,051 $ 11,552 $ 7,574 Hypothetical amounts applicable to above computed at the federal statutory rate $ 6,668 $ 4,043 $ 2,651 Tax-exempt interest income (27 ) (33 ) (88 ) Dividends received deduction (477 ) (479 ) (415 ) State income taxes, less federal income tax benefit 219 81 162 Foreign tax rate differences (154 ) (92 ) (59 ) BNSF holding gain (342 )   Non-taxable exchange of investment   (154 ) Other differences, net (280 ) 18 (119 ) $ 5,607 $ 3,538 $ 1,978 84 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (15) Income taxes (Continued) We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in state, local and foreign jurisdictions. We are under examination by the taxing authorities in many of these jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we have settled tax return liabilities with U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities for years before 2002. We anticipate that we will resolve all adjustments proposed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the 2002 through 2004 tax years at the IRS Appeals Division within the next 12 months. The IRS has completed its examination of our consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns for the 2005 and 2006 tax years and the proposed adjustments are currently being reviewed by the IRS Appeals Division process. The IRS is currently auditing our consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns for the 2007 through 2009 tax years. It is reasonably possible that certain of our income tax examinations will be settled within the next twelve months. We currently believe that there are no jurisdictions in which the outcome of unresolved issues or claims is likely to be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
At December31, 2010 and 2009, net unrecognized tax benefits were $1,005million and $926million, respectively. Included in the balance at December31, 2010, are $774million of tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The remaining balance in net unrecognized tax benefits principally relates to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. As of December31, 2010, we do not expect any material changes to the estimated amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months.
(16) Dividend restrictions  Insurance subsidiaries Payments of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance statutes and regulations. Without prior regulatory approval, our principal insurance subsidiaries may declare up to approximately $9billion as ordinary dividends before the end of 2011.
Combined shareholders equity of U.S. based property/casualty insurance subsidiaries determined pursuant to statutory accounting rules (Statutory Surplus as Regards Policyholders) was approximately $94billion at December31, 2010 and $64billion at December31, 2009. A significant portion of the increase in statutory surplus in 2010 was due to capital contributions by Berkshire in connection with the BNSF acquisition. BNSF is a wholly-owned subsidiary of National Indemnity Company, a U.S. based Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Statutory surplus differs from the corresponding amount determined on the basis of GAAP. The major differences between statutory basis accounting and GAAP are that deferred charges reinsurance assumed, deferred policy acquisition costs, unrealized gains and losses on investments in fixed maturity securities and related deferred income taxes are recognized for GAAP but not for statutory reporting purposes. In addition, statutory accounting for goodwill of acquired businesses requires amortization of goodwill over 10 years, whereas under GAAP, goodwill is not amortized and is subject to periodic tests for impairment.
85 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (17) Fair value measurements The estimated fair values of our financial instruments are shown in the following table (inmillions). The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities are deemed to be reasonable estimates of their fair values.
Carrying Value Fair Value December31, 2010 December31, 2009 December31, 2010 December31, 2009 Investments in fixed maturity securities $ 34,883 $ 37,131 $ 34,883 $ 37,131 Investments in equity securities 61,513 59,034 61,513 59,034 Other investments 23,009 32,600 24,147 34,540 Loans and finance receivables 15,226 13,989 14,453 12,415 Derivative contract assets (1) 574 454 574 454 Notes payable and other borrowings: Insurance and other 12,471 4,561 12,705 4,669 Railroad, utilities and energy 31,626 19,579 33,932 20,868 Finance and financial products 14,477 13,769 15,191 14,355 Derivative contract liabilities: Railroad, utilities and energy (2) 621 581 621 581 Finance and financial products 8,371 9,269 8,371 9,269 (1 ) Included in Other assets (2 ) Included in Accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. Fair value measurements assume the asset or liability is exchanged in an orderly manner; the exchange is in the principal market for that asset or liability (or in the most advantageous market when no principal market exists); and the market participants are independent, knowledgeable, able and willing to transact an exchange.
Fair values for substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in an actual current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value.
The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3.
Level 1 Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Substantially all of our equity investments are traded on an exchange in active markets and fair values are based on the closing prices as of the balance sheet date.
Level 2 Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Fair values for our investments in fixed maturity securities are primarily based on price evaluations which incorporate market prices for identical instruments in inactive markets and market data available for instruments with similar characteristics. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit rating, estimated duration, and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector.
Level 3 Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities or related observable inputs that can be corroborated at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in pricing assets or liabilities. Measurements of non-exchange traded derivative contracts and certain other investments carried at fair value are based primarily on valuation models, discounted cash flow models or other valuation techniques that are believed to be used by market participants. We value equity index put option contracts based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model which we believe is widely used by market participants. Inputs to this model include current index 86 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (17) Fair value measurements (Continued) price, expected volatility, dividend and interest rates and contract duration. Credit default contracts are primarily valued based on indications of bid or offer data as of the balance sheet date. These contracts are not exchange traded and certain of the terms of our contracts are not standard in derivatives markets. For example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. For these reasons, we classified these contracts as Level 3.
Financial assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis in our financial statements are summarized according to the hierarchy previously described as follows (inmillions).

Other investments with Level 3 measurements at December31, 2010 and 2009 include our investments in GS, GE, Dow and Wrigley preferred stock and the GS and GE warrants and at December31, 2009 also included our investment in the Swiss Re instrument.
(18) Common stock On January20, 2010, our shareholders approved proposals to increase the authorized number of Class B common shares from 55,000,000 to 3,225,000,000 and to effect a 50-for-1 split of the Class B common stock which became effective on January21, 2010. The ClassA common stock was not split. Thereafter, each share of ClassA common stock became convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into ClassA common stock. The Class B share data in the following table and the related disclosures regarding Class B shares are presented on a post-split basis for all periods.
Changes in issued and outstanding Berkshire common stock during the three years ended December31, 2010 are shown in the table below.

Each ClassA common share is entitled to one vote per share. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equivalent to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000)of the voting rights of a ClassA share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, ClassA and Class B common shares vote as a single class.
On an equivalent ClassA common stock basis, there were 1,648,120 shares outstanding as of December31, 2010 and 1,551,749 shares outstanding as of December31, 2009. The Class B stock split had no effect on the number of equivalent ClassA common shares outstanding. In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued and outstanding.
(19) Pension plans Several of our subsidiaries individually sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees. Benefits under the plans are generally based on years of service and compensation, although benefits under certain plans are based on years of service and fixed benefit rates. Contributions to the plans are made, generally, to meet regulatory requirements. Additional amounts may be contributed as determined by management based on actuarial valuations.
88 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (19) Pension plans (Continued) The components of net periodic pension expense for each of the three years ending December31, 2010 are as follows (inmillions).

As of December31, 2010 and 2009, the accumulated benefit obligation was $9,954million and $7,379million, respectively. The projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of benefits earned based upon service and compensation prior to the valuation date and, if applicable, includes assumptions regarding future compensation levels. Information regarding projected benefit obligations is shown in the table that follows (inmillions).

Pension obligations under certain non-U.S. plans and non-qualified U.S. plans are unfunded. As of December31, 2010, projected benefit obligations of non-qualified U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans which are not funded through assets held in trusts were $797million. A reconciliation of the changes in plan assets and a summary of plan assets held as of December31, 2010 and 2009 is presented in the table that follows (inmillions).

Pension plan assets are generally invested with the long-term objective of earning sufficient amounts to cover expected benefit obligations, while assuming a prudent level of risk. Allocations may change as a result of changing market conditions and investment opportunities. The expected rates of return on plan assets reflect subjective assessments of expected invested asset returns over a period of several years. Generally, past investment returns are not given significant consideration when establishing assumptions for expected long-term rates of returns on plan assets. Actual experience will differ from the assumed rates.
The defined benefit plans expect to pay benefits to participants over the next ten years, reflecting expected future service as appropriate, as follows (inmillions): 2011  $588; 2012  $606; 2013  $625; 2014  $645; 2015 $650; and 2016 to 2020  $3,431. Sponsoring subsidiaries expect to contribute $340million to defined benefit pension plans in 2011.
As of December31, 2010 and 2009, the net funded status of the plans is summarized in the table that follows (inmillions).

Employee contributions to the plans are subject to regulatory limitations and the specific plan provisions. Several of the plans require that the subsidiary match these contributions up to levels specified in the plans and provide for additional discretionary contributions as determined by management. Expenses related to employer contributions for these plans were $567million, $540million and $519million for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Certain subsidiaries contribute to multiemployer retirement plans. Contributions by these subsidiaries to such plans were $78million in 2010, $22million in 2009 and $23million in 2008. The increase in 2010 was due to contributions by BNSF.
(20) Contingencies and Commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions arising out of the normal course of business. In particular, such legal actions affect our insurance and reinsurance businesses. Such litigation generally seeks to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties in substantial amounts.
a) Civil Litigation Litigation Related to ROA General Reinsurance Corporation (General Reinsurance), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire, and several current and former employees, along with numerous other defendants, have been sued in fourteen federal lawsuits involving Reciprocal of America (ROA) and related entities. ROA was a Virginia-based reciprocal insurer and reinsurer of physician, hospital and lawyer professional liability risks. Ten are putative class actions initiated by doctors, hospitals and lawyers that purchased insurance through ROA or certain of its Tennessee-based risk retention groups. These complaints seek compensatory, treble, and punitive damages in an amount plaintiffs contend is just and reasonable. The most recently filed action was filed in April 2010 by the same attorneys representing the same hospitals as in three of the other putative class actions pending in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee. The allegations are virtually identical to the previously filed hospital policyholder actions.
General Reinsurance is also subject to actions brought by the Virginia Commissioner of Insurance, as Deputy Receiver of ROA, the Tennessee Commissioner of Insurance, as Receiver for purposes of liquidating three Tennessee risk retention groups, a state lawsuit filed by a Missouri-based hospital group that was removed to federal court and another state lawsuit filed by an Alabama doctor that was also removed to federal court. The first of these actions was filed in March 2003 and additional actions were filed in April 2003 through June 2006. Twelve of these cases are collectively assigned to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee for pretrial proceedings.
General Reinsurance has settled with both the Virginia and Tennessee Receivers, whose respective claims against General Reinsurance and its current and former employees have been dismissed with prejudice. The Missouri-based hospital group has also agreed to dismiss its claims against General Reinsurance.
Actions related to AIG General Reinsurance is a defendant in In re American International Group Securities Litigation, Case No.04-CV-8141-(LTS), United States District Court, Southern District of New York, a putative class action (the AIG Securities Litigation) 91 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (20) Contingencies and Commitments (Continued) asserted on behalf of investors who purchased publicly-traded securities of AIG between October 1999 and March 2005. The complaint, originally filed in April 2005, asserts various claims against AIG and certain of its officers, directors, investment banks and other parties, including former employees of General Reinsurance (whom the Complaint defines, together with General Reinsurance, as the General Re Defendants). The Complaint alleges that the General Re Defendants violated Section10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 in connection with General Reinsurances transaction with AIG initially effected in 2000 (the AIG Transaction). The Complaint seeks damages and other relief in unspecified amounts. General Reinsurance has answered the Complaint, denying liability and asserting various affirmative defenses. Lead plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on February20, 2008. Various defendants, including General Reinsurance, have filed oppositions to class certification. The lead plaintiffs and General Reinsurance previously reached agreement concerning the terms of a settlement that would resolve all claims against the General Re Defendants in exchange for a payment by General Reinsurance of $72million, out of which the court may award plaintiffs counsel no more than $11.5million in fees and reimbursement of costs, with the remaining amount of at least $60.5million to be distributed to purchasers of AIG securities. There was no court decision specifically approving or disapproving this settlement but rather, on February22, 2010, the court granted class certification with respect to claims against AIG, and denied class certification with respect to claims against General Reinsurance. On September23, 2010, the court entered a final judgment dismissing the General Re Defendants from the case. On October21, 2010, the lead plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and the putative class, filed a notice of appeal of that final judgment, and also appealed from the courts February22, 2010 order (granting in part and denying in part the lead plaintiffs motion to certify the class, but only to the extent the order denied class certification as against the General Re Defendants), and the courts March4, 2010 order denying as moot the lead plaintiffs motion for preliminary court approval of the class action settlement with General Re.
A member of the putative class in the litigation described in the preceding paragraph has asserted similar claims against General Reinsurance and a former officer of General Reinsurance in a separate complaint, Florida State Board of Administration v. General Re Corporation, et al., Case No.06-CV-3967, United States District Court, Southern District of New York. The parties have settled this matter, the terms of which will require dismissal of this action with prejudice.
On July27, 2005, General Reinsurance received a Summons and a Verified and Amended Shareholder Derivative Complaint in In re American International Group, Inc. Derivative Litigation, Case No.04-CV-08406, United States District Court, Southern District of New York. The complaint, brought by several alleged shareholders of AIG, seeks damages, injunctive and declaratory relief against various officers and directors of AIG as well as a variety of individuals and entities with whom AIG did business, relating to a wide variety of allegedly wrongful practices by AIG. Plaintiffs have petitioned the court to dismiss the action with prejudice as to all defendants.
In August 2005, General Reinsurance received a Summons and First Amended Consolidated Shareholders Derivative Complaint in In re American International Group, Inc. Consolidated Derivative Litigation, Case No.769-N, Delaware Chancery Court. On September28, 2007, AIG and the shareholder plaintiffs filed a Second Combined Amended Complaint, in which AIG asserted claims against certain of its former officers and the shareholder plaintiffs asserted claims against a number of other defendants, including General Reinsurance. On July13, 2009, the Delaware Chancery Court entered judgment dismissing with prejudice the claims asserted against General Reinsurance and certain other defendants in the matter. By Order dated December29, 2010, the Delaware Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the Chancery Court dismissal of the claims against General Reinsurance and certain other defendants.
FAI/HIH Matter In December 2003, the Liquidators of both FAI Insurance Limited (FAI) and HIH Insurance Limited (HIH) advised indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Berkshire (General Reinsurance Australia Limited (GRA) and Klnische Rckversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG (Cologne Re)) that they intended to assert claims arising from insurance transactions GRA entered into with FAI in May and June 1998. In August 2004, the Liquidators filed claims in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in order to avoid the expiration of a statute of limitations for certain plaintiffs. The focus of the Liquidators allegations against GRA and Cologne Re are the 1998 transactions GRA entered into with FAI (which was acquired by HIH in 1999). The Liquidators contend, among other things, that GRA and Cologne Re engaged in deceptive conduct that assisted FAI in improperly accounting for such transactions as reinsurance, and that such deception led to HIHs acquisition of FAI and caused various losses to FAI and HIH. The Liquidator of HIH served its Complaint on GRA and Cologne Re in June 2006 and 92 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (20) Contingencies and Commitments (Continued) discovery has been ongoing. The FAI Liquidator previously dismissed his complaint against GRA and Cologne Re. GRA and Cologne Re have finalized their settlement with the HIH Liquidator and as a result on March24, 2010 court orders were entered dismissing the HIH Liquidators action in its entirety.
We have established reserves for certain of the legal proceedings discussed above where we have concluded that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of current pending civil litigation, including the matters discussed above, will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
b) Commitments We lease certain manufacturing, warehouse, retail and office facilities as well as certain equipment. Rent expense for all operating leases was $1,204million in 2010, $701million in 2009 and $725million in 2008. The increase in 2010 was due to the BNSF acquisition. Minimum rental payments for operating leases having initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year are as follows. Amounts are inmillions.
2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After 2015 Total $1,156 $ 1,043 $ 910 $ 816 $ 740 $ 4,456 $ 9,121 Several of our subsidiaries have made commitments in the ordinary course of business to purchase goods and services used in their businesses. The most significant of these relate to our railroad, utilities and energy businesses. As of December31, 2010, commitments under all such subsidiary arrangements were approximately $9.8billion in 2011, $4.4billion in 2012, $4.3billion in 2013, $3.1billion in 2014, $2.5billion in 2015 and $10.8billion after 2015.
In the first quarter of 2011, we are acquiring an additional 16.6% of the outstanding common stock of Marmon, thus increasing our total ownership interest to 80.2%. We currently estimate the cost of this additional share purchase to be approximately $1.5billion. The purchase of these shares is being accounted for as an acquisition of noncontrolling interest. Accordingly, the difference of approximately $600 million between the consideration expected to be paid and the prior carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest being acquired has been recorded as a reduction to Berkshires shareholders equity. Berkshire will acquire substantially all of the remaining equity interests in Marmon in 2013 or 2014. However, the consideration ultimately payable is contingent upon future operating results of Marmon and the per-share cost could be greater than or less than the price in 2011.
We currently own 80.1% of the outstanding common stock of Wesco Financial Corporation (Wesco) and on February4, 2011, we entered into an agreement to acquire the 19.9% noncontrolling interests in Wesco that we did not already own for a price that is based on Wescos estimated shareholders equity per share at the time the acquisition closes. Based on Wescos shareholders equity at December31, 2010, the cost to acquire these shares would be approximately $550million, payable at the election of the Wesco shareholders in either cash or Berkshire Class B common stock. The acquisition is subject to customary prior approvals including the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of Wescos outstanding shares not owned by Berkshire.
Pursuant to the terms of shareholder agreements with noncontrolling shareholders in certain of our other less than wholly-owned subsidiaries, we may be obligated to acquire their equity ownership interests. The consideration payable for such interests is generally based on the fair value. If we acquired all such outstanding noncontrolling interests as of December31, 2010, the cost would have been approximately $2.9billion. However, the timing and the amount of any such future payments that might be required are contingent on future actions of the noncontrolling owners and future operating results of the related subsidiaries.
(21) Business segment data Our reportable business segments are organized in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses have been grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines, marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management.
The tabular information that follows shows data of reportable segments reconciled to amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Intersegment transactions are not eliminated in instances where management considers those transactions in assessing the results of the respective segments. Furthermore, our management does not consider investment and derivative 93 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (21) Business segment data (Continued) gains/losses or amortization of purchase accounting adjustments in assessing the performance of reporting units. Collectively, these items are included in reconciliations of segment amounts to consolidated amounts.

The proceeds from these borrowings together with approximately $3.9 billion of available cash were contributed to a wholly-owned subsidiary in connection with the acquisition of all remaining outstanding shares of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation. Berkshires borrowings at December31, 2010 and 2009 also included $360 million and $340 million, respectively, from investment agreements. Principal is payable under certain conditions at par prior to maturity. Berkshires aggregate borrowings as of December31, 2010, mature as follows: 2011$2,085 million; 2012$1,700 million; 2013$2,600 million; 2014 and thereafter$1,975 million.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has guaranteed debt obligations of certain of its subsidiaries. As of December31, 2010, the unpaid balance of subsidiary debt guaranteed by Berkshire totaled approximately $15 billion. Berkshires guarantee of subsidiary debt is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all present and future payment obligations. Berkshire also provides guarantees in connection with long-term equity index put option and credit default contracts entered into by a subsidiary. The estimated fair value of liabilities recorded under such contracts was approximately $8.0 billion as of December31, 2010. The amount of subsidiary payments under these contracts, if any, is contingent upon future events. The timing of subsidiary payments, if any, will not be fully known for several decades. In the first quarter of 2011, Berkshire will acquire certain non-controlling interests of Marmon Holdings, Inc. for approximately $1.5 billion, thus increasing Berkshires ownership interest to approximately 80.2%.
