These joint ventures manufacture Cummins-designed medium-duty engines in Japan and Komatsu-designed high-horsepower engines in the U.S. The industrial engine design joint venture is located in Japan.
Cummins-Scania XPI Manufacturing,LLC  Cummins-Scania XPI Manufacturing,LLC is a joint venture in the United States with Scania Holding,Inc. This joint venture manufactures several models of advanced fuel systems for heavy-duty and midrange diesel engines.
Cummins Olayan EnergyLtd.
Cummins Olayan EnergyLtd. is a joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with General Contracting Company to operate certain rental power generation equipment, which is primarily utilized within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Guangxi Cummins Industrial PowerCo.,Ltd.
Guangxi Cummins Industrial PowerCo.,Ltd. is a joint venture in China with Guangxi LiuGong MachineryCo. This joint venture manufactures 6.7 liter and 9.3 liter diesel engines for use in various construction equipment.
Fleetguard Filters Private,Ltd.
Fleetguard Filters Private,Ltd. is a joint venture in India with Perfect Sealing System Private Limited that manufactures and sells filtration systems primarily for commercial vehicle applications.
Cummins MerCruiser Diesel Marine,LLC  Cummins MerCruiser Diesel Marine,LLC (CMD) was a joint venture in the U.S. with Mercury Marine, a division of Brunswick Corporation, to develop, manufacture and sell recreational marine diesel products, including engines, sterndrive packages, inboard packages, instrument and controls, service systems and replacement and service parts and assemblies, complete integration systems and other related products. In April 2012, we executed our plans to dissolve the joint venture and to transition to a strategic supply arrangement between the two companies to more effectively and efficiently serve customers in the global diesel marine market. All business activities were moved from CMD to the parent companies at the time of the dissolution. We will continue to use Mercury Marine drives and control systems in conjunction with its extensive offering of mid-range and heavy-duty marine engines. The dissolution of the joint venture did not have a significant impact on our financial results.
Non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiary We have a controlling interest in Cummins IndiaLtd. (CIL), which is a publicly listed company on various stock exchanges in India. CIL produces mid-range, heavy-duty and high-horsepower engines, generators for the Indian and export markets and natural gas spark-ignited engines for power generation, automotive and industrial applications. CIL also has distribution and power generation 13 Table of Contents operations. CIL's net income attributable to Cummins was $42million, $44million and $46million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
SUPPLY The performance of the end-to-end supply chain, extending through to our suppliers, is foundational to our ability to meet customers' expectations and support long-term growth. In order to ensure we meet the needs of our customers, we are committed to having a robust strategy for how we select and manage our suppliers.
We have a strategic sourcing policy that guides decisions on what we make, when we establish supplier partnerships and what we purchase. Today we machine and assemble strategic components used in our engines and power generation units, including blocks, heads, turbochargers, connecting rods, camshafts, crankshafts, filters, alternators and fuel systems. We source externally purchased material and manufactured components from leading suppliers both domestically and internationally. Many suppliers are managed though long-term agreements that assure capacity, delivery, quality and cost requirements are met over an extended period. We have a "take or pay" contract with an emission solutions business supplier requiring us to purchase approximately $73million annually through 2018. Approximately 60 to 70percent of the total types of parts in our product designs are single sourced. Although we elect to source a relatively high proportion of our total raw materials and components from sole suppliers, we have an established annual sourcing strategy process that evaluates risk. This annual review process has led us to begin increasing our use of dual sourcing to both minimize risk and increase supply chain responsiveness.
Other important elements of our sourcing strategy include:  working with suppliers to measure and improve their environmental footprint;  selecting and managing suppliers to comply with our supplier code of conduct and  assuring our suppliers do not use restricted or prohibited materials in our products.
PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS We own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture. These patents and trademarks were granted and registered over a period of years. Although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations, we do not believe any patent, group of patents, or trademark (other than our leading brand house trademarks) is significant to our business.
SEASONALITY While individual product lines may experience modest seasonal variation in production, there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exception that our Power Generation segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in construction spending during this period and our Distribution segment normally experiences seasonal declines in its first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in Asia and Australia.
LARGEST CUSTOMERS We have thousands of customers around the world and have developed long-standing business relationships with many of them. PACCAR is our largest customer, accounting for approximately 13percent of our consolidated net sales in 2012, compared to approximately 12percent in 2011 and 7percent in 2010. We have long-term supply agreements with PACCAR for our heavy-duty ISX 15 liter 14 Table of Contents and ISX 11.9 liter engines and our ISL 9 liter mid-range engine. While a significant number of our sales to PACCAR are under long-term supply agreements, these agreements provide for particular engine requirements for specific vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines. PACCAR is our only customer accounting for more than 10percent of our net sales in 2012. The loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of PACCAR vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We have been an engine supplier to PACCAR for over 68years. A summary of principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion.
In addition to our agreement with PACCAR, we have long-term heavy-duty engine supply agreements with Volvo Trucks North America and Navistar International Corporation and long-term mid-range supply agreements with Daimler Trucks North America, Ford and MAN. We also have an agreement with Chrysler to supply engines for its Ram trucks. In our off-highway markets, we have various engine and component supply agreements ranging across our midrange and high-horsepower businesses with KomatsuLtd., as well as various joint ventures and other license agreements in our Engine, Component and Distribution segments. Collectively, our net sales to these seven customers, including PACCAR, was approximately 33percent of our consolidated net sales in 2012, compared to approximately 31percent in 2011 and 25percent in 2010. Excluding PACCAR, net sales to individual customers were less than 8percent of our consolidated net sales to any single customer in 2012, compared to less than 6percent in 2011 and less than 4percent in 2010. These agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing, quality and delivery commitments, as well as engineering product support obligations. The basic nature of our agreements with OEM customers is that they are long-term price and operations agreements that help assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements. Agreements with most OEMscontain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach, change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party.
BACKLOG Our 2012 lead times for the majority of our businesses improved from their 2011 levels. While we have supply agreements with some truck and off-highway equipment OEMs, most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders. These open orders are historically subject to month-to-month releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE In 2012, we increased our research, development and engineering expenses as we continued to invest in future critical technologies and products. We will continue to make investments to improve our current technologies, continue to meet the future emission requirements around the world and improve fuel economy.
Our research and development program is focused on product improvements, innovations and cost reductions for our customers. Research and development expenditures include salaries, contractor fees, building costs, utilities, administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed, net of contract reimbursements, when incurred. Research and development expenses, net of contract reimbursements, were $721million in 2012, $621million in 2011 and $402million in 2010. Contract reimbursements were $86million in 2012, $75million in 2011 and $68million in 2010.
For 2011 and 2010, approximately $1million and $38million or less than 1percent and 9percent, respectively, of our research and development expenditures were directly related to compliance with 2010 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emission standards. For 2012, 2011 and 2010, 15 Table of Contents approximately $101million, $104million and $36million or 14percent, 17percent and 9percent, of our research and development expenditures were directly related to compliance with 2013 EPA emission standards.
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY Our Environmental Sustainability principles attempt to positively impact the environment through the products that we make, how we use our facilities and how we impact communities where we live and work. Our newly formed Corporate Action Committee for Environmental Sustainability is developing a global plan to more fully integrate environmental stewardship across all of our businesses and functions. We continue to invest significantly to further reduce emissions from and increase the efficiency of our products. We attempt to work collaboratively with customers to improve their fuel economy, reduce their carbon footprints and conserve other resources. Over the past four years, we believe that we have reduced company-wide water usage intensity by approximately 45percent, U.S.-wide process-derived hazardous waste generation by approximately 52percent and company-wide landfill waste by approximately 28percent, all normalized to total work hours. We also have articulated our positions on key public policy issues and on a wide range of environmental issues. We are actively engaged with regulatory, industry and other stakeholder groups around the world as GHG and fuel efficiency standards become more prevalent globally. For the eighth consecutive year, we were named to the Dow Jones World Sustainability Index, which recognizes the top 10percent of the world's largest 2,500 companies in economic, environmental and social leadership. We were also named the top environmentally conscious industrial company in the U.S. in Newsweek's Green Rankings. Our Sustainability Report for 2011/2012 as well as an addendum of more detailed environmental data is available on our website at www.cummins.com, although such report and addendum are not incorporated into this Form10-K.
ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE Product Environmental Compliance Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emission and noise. We have substantially increased our global environmental compliance presence and expertise to better prepare for, understand and ultimately meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world. Our products comply with all current emission standards that the European Union (EU), EPA, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and other state and international regulatory agencies have established for heavy-duty on-highway diesel and gas engines and off-highway engines. Our ability to comply with these and future emission standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets. We have made, and will continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards. Our failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results.
EU and EPA Engine Certifications The current on-highway emission standards came into effect in the EU on October1, 2008 (EuroV)and on January1, 2010 for the EPA. To meet the more stringent heavy-duty on-highway emission standards, we used an evolution of our proven selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) technology solutions and refined them for the EU and EPA certified engines to maintain power and torque with substantial fuel economy improvement and maintenance intervals comparable with our previous compliant engines. We offer a complete lineup of on-highway engines to meet the near-zero emission standards. Mid-range and heavy-duty engines for EU and EPA require NOx aftertreatment. NOx reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the XPI High Pressure Common Rail fuel system, SCR technology, next-generation cooled EGR, advanced 16 Table of Contents electronic controls, proven air handling and the Cummins Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). The EU, EPA, and CARB have certified that our engines meet the current emission requirements. Emission standards in international markets, including Japan, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, Russia, India and China are becoming more stringent. We believe that our experience in meeting the EU and EPA emission standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emission control capability grows.
We have received certification from the EPA that we have met both the EPA 2013 and 2014 GHG regulations and rules. The EPA 2013 regulations add the requirement of On-Board Diagnostics, which were introduced on the ISX15 in 2010, across the full on-highway product line in 2013 in addition to maintaining the same near-zero emission levels of NOx and Particulate Matter (PM) required in 2010. On-Board Diagnostics provide enhanced service capability with standardized diagnostic trouble codes, service tool interface, in-cab warning lamp and service information availability. The new GHG and fuel-efficiency regulations will be required for all heavy-duty diesel and natural gas engines beginning in January 2014. Our GHG certification is the first engine certificate issued by the EPA and uses the same proven base engine with the XPI fuel system, Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT), Cummins Aftertreatment System with DPF and SCR technology and fully integrated electronics.
Other Environmental Statutes and Regulations Expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the U.S. have not been a substantial portion of our annual capital outlays and are not expected to be material in 2013. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations.
In the U.S., pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies and/or defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended or similar state laws, at approximately 20 waste disposal sites. Based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be significant. We have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites.
In addition, we have several other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects. The costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material.
EMPLOYEES As of December31, 2012, we employed approximately 46,000 persons worldwide. Approximately 15,750 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2013 and 2015.

19 Table of Contents ITEM 1A.Risk Factors Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report and could individually, or in combination, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Report, including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our separate section above, "CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION," should be considered in addition to the following statements.
A sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
The global economy continued to slow throughout 2012 as we experienced declining demand in emerging markets, including Brazil and China, and a decline in India as the result of foreign currency fluctuations. The developed economies, including the U.S. economy, experienced slowing demand as the year progressed and continued to experience economic uncertainty driven by unresolved federal tax and budget issues, while Europe continued to struggle as the result of lingering high unemployment, concerns over European sovereign debt issues and the tightening of government budgets. If the global economy or some of our significant markets encounter a sustained slowdown or our emerging markets, particularly China and Brazil, don't recover to stronger growth rates; depending upon the length, duration and severity of such a slowdown, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow would almost certainly be materially adversely affected. Specifically, our revenues would likely decrease, we may be forced to consider further restructuring actions, we may need to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, our days sales outstanding may increase and we could experience impairments to assets of certain of our businesses.
A slowdown in infrastructure development could adversely affect our business.
Infrastructure development has been a significant driver of our business in recent years, especially in the emerging markets of China and Brazil. In 2012, infrastructure spending in emerging markets steadily declined throughout the year. General weakness in economic growth or the perception that infrastructure has been overbuilt could lead to a further decline in infrastructure spending. Any sustained downturns in infrastructure development that result from these or other circumstances could adversely affect our business.
Unpredictability in the adoption, implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world could adversely affect our business.
Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emission and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, the European Union, state regulatory agencies (such as the CARB) and other regulatory agencies around the world. We have made, and will be required to continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these emission standards. Developing engines to meet numerous changing government regulatory requirements, with different implementation timelines and emission requirements, makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets. In some cases, we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations, particularly those relating to air emission. While we have met previous deadlines, our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve. The successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such 20 Table of Contents as delays in product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties.
In addition to these risks, the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards around the world is unpredictable and subject to change, or delays which could result in the products we developed or modified to comply with these standards becoming unnecessary or becoming necessary later than expected and in some cases negating our competitive advantage. This in turn can delay, diminish or eliminate the expected return on capital and research expenditures that we have invested in such products and may adversely affect our perceived competitive advantage in being an early, advanced developer of compliant engines.
We derive significant income from investees that we do not directly control.
Our net income includes significant equity, royalty and interest income from investees that we do not directly control. For 2012, we recognized $384million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees, compared to $416million in 2011. The majority of our equity, royalty and interest income from investees is from our 11 unconsolidated North American distributors and from two of our joint ventures in China, Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company,Ltd. (DCEC) and Chongqing Cummins Engine Company,Ltd. (CCEC). Our equity ownership interests in our unconsolidated North American distributors generally range from 30percent to 50percent. We have 50percent equity ownership interests in DCEC and CCEC. As a result, although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities, we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations, which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these other entities. A significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Our truck manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) customers may not continue to outsource their engine supply needs.
Several of our engine customers, including PACCAR, Volvo AB, Navistar International Corporation and Chrysler, are truck manufacturers or OEMsthat manufacture engines for some of their own products. Despite their own engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products, our emission capabilities, our systems integration, their customers' preferences, their desire for cost reductions, their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their engine production in the future. Increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers' business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
A downturn in the North American truck industry or other factors negatively affecting any of our truck OEM customers could materially adversely impact our results of operations.
We make significant sales of engines and components to a few large truck OEMsin North America. If the North American truck market suffers a significant downturn, or if one of our large truck OEM customers experienced financial distress or bankruptcy, such circumstance would likely lead to significant reductions in our revenues and earnings, commercial disputes, receivable collection issues, and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
21 Table of Contents The discovery of any significant problems with our new engine platforms in North America could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
The EPA and CARB have certified all of our 2012/2013 on-highway and off-highway engines, which utilize SCR technology to meet requisite emission levels. We introduced SCR technology into our engine platforms in 2010. The effective performance of SCR technology and the overall performance of these engine platforms impact a number of our operating segments and remain crucial to our success in North America. While these 2010 engine platforms have performed well in the field, the discovery of any significant problems in these platforms could result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, reputational risk and brand risk, and could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
We are subject to currency exchange rate and other related risks.
We conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. While we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks and many of our supply agreements with customers include currency exchange rate adjustment provisions, there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
We also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.
We are vulnerable to supply shortages from single-sourced suppliers.
During 2012, we single sourced approximately 60 to 70percent of the total types of parts in our product designs. Any delay in our suppliers' deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations, forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions. Delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers, including capacity constraints, labor disputes, economic downturns, availability of credit, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies, natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism. Any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and our results of operations.
Our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs.
Our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames; however, the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions. Additionally, higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. While we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks (notably with respect to copper, platinum and palladium), there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, while the use of commodity price hedging instruments may provide 22 Table of Contents us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price. As a result, higher material and commodity costs, as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices, could result in declining margins.
Our products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues.
Our products may be subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation, loss of current and future customers, reduced revenue and product recall costs. Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue. Any significant product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
We face significant competition in the markets we serve.
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. We primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products; however, new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline, natural gas and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, fuel economy, speed of delivery, quality and customer support. We also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets. For a more complete discussion of the competitive environment in which each of our segments operates, see "Operating Segments" in "Item1 Business." Increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers' growth.
As our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope, they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries. This has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets, as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing. As these emerging market customers enter into and begin to compete in more developed markets, they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets. Our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers and, as a result, we may be pressured to restrict sale or support of some of our products in the areas of increased competition. In addition, to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand, we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers.
We are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business.
Approximately 53percent of our net sales for 2012 and 59percent in 2011 were attributable to customers outside the U.S. Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risks include:  the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; 23 Table of Contents  the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S.;  the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations;  required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and  changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets.
As we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us.
Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability.
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the distribution of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes to our assertions regarding permanent re-investment of our foreign earnings, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. The carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision.
We are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy.
The level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy. High energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate. Some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements, and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected, demand for these products may likewise decrease. The relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products, such as our diesel generators. If these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy, the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case.
Our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk.
Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world. Recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti-corruption such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws from other countries. Our numerous foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws, rules and business practices that 24 Table of Contents differ from those of the U.S. The activities of these entities may not comply with U.S. laws or business practices or our Code of Business Conduct. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.
We face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand.
We can experience capacity constraints and longer lead times for certain products in times of growing demand while we can also experience idle capacity as economies slow or demand for certain products decline. Accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity have been, and will continue to be, important factors in determining our results of operations. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase manufacturing capacity to a level that meets demand for our products, which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and could harm our business. However, if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity, we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins. If we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Our business is exposed to risks of product liability claims.
We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products' failure to perform to specification results or is alleged to result in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. We may experience material product liability losses in the future. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims. In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful defense of a significant product liability claim could have a material adverse effect upon us. In addition, even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us.
We may need to write off significant investments in our new North American light-duty diesel engine platform if customer commitments further deteriorate.
We began development of a new North American light-duty diesel engine platform in July 2006 to be used in a variety of on- and off-highway applications. Since that time, and as of December31, 2012, we have capitalized investments of approximately $233million. Market uncertainty due to the global recession resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs, while others remain active. If customer expectations or volume projections further deteriorate from our current expected levels and we do not identify new customers, we may need to recognize an impairment charge and write the assets down to net realizable value.
Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations.
Our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations governing air emission, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either 25 Table of Contents present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material.
Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans. Our pension expense and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value. We could experience increased pension expense due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets.
Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets, which could result in increased pension expense in future years and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes, we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the U.S. and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material.
We may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.
As of December31, 2012, we employed approximately 46,000 persons worldwide. Approximately 15,750 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2013 and 2015. While we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters, there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. Any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slow-downs experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slow-downs or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
Our financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position.
Our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Recently, accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and lease accounting as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on Form10-K and Form10-Q. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore, their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the reported results of operations and financial position.

We also have been identified as a potentially responsible party at multiple waste disposal sites under U.S. federal and related state environmental statutes and regulations and may have joint and several liability for any investigation and remediation costs incurred with respect to such sites. We have denied liability with respect to many of these lawsuits, claims and proceedings and are vigorously defending such lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We carry various forms of commercial, property and casualty, product liability and other forms of insurance; however, such insurance may not be applicable or adequate to cover the costs associated with a judgment against us with respect to these lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We do not believe that these lawsuits are material individually or in the aggregate. While we believe we have also established adequate accruals for our expected future liability with respect to pending lawsuits, claims and proceedings, where the nature and extent of any such liability can be reasonably estimated based upon then presently available information, there can be no assurance that the final resolution of any existing or future lawsuits, claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
We conduct significant business operations in Brazil that are subject to the Brazilian federal, state and local labor, social security, tax and customs laws. While we believe we comply with such laws, they 28 Table of Contents are complex, subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances.

For the year ended December31, 2010, consolidated net income included $32million in Brazil tax recoveries ($21million after-tax) and $2million in flood damage expenses. In 2010 it was determined that we overpaid a Brazilian revenue based tax during the period of 2004-2008. Consolidated net income includes a pre-tax recovery related to tax credits on imported products arising from this overpayment. For the year ended December31, 2009, consolidated net income included $99million in restructuring and other charges ($65million after-tax) and a gain of $12million related to flood damage recoveries. For the year ended December31, 2008, consolidated net income included a $37million restructuring charge ($26million after-tax), a $36million decrease in cash surrender value in corporate owned life insurance and $5million of losses related to flood damages.
31 Table of Contents (2) On January1, 2009, we adopted changes issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board to consolidation accounting and reporting. These changes, among others, require that minority interests be renamed noncontrolling interests and a company present a consolidated net income measure that includes the amount attributable to such noncontrolling interests for all periods presented.
(3) In 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2008, we recorded non-cash charges (credits) to equity of $83million, $96million, $(125)million and $433million, respectively, to reflect gains and losses associated with the effect of market conditions on our pension plans.
32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our business through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements. Our MD&A is presented in the following sections:  Executive Summary and Financial Highlights  2013 Outlook  Results of Operations  Restructuring and Other Charges  Operating Segment Results  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments  Application of Critical Accounting Estimates  Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and engine-related component products, including filtration, aftertreatment, turbochargers, fuel systems, controls systems, air handling systems and electric power generation systems. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide. We have long-standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, including PACCAR Inc, Daimler Trucks North America, Chrysler Group,LLC, Volvo AB, Komatsu, Navistar International Corporation, Aggrekoplc, Ford Motor Company and MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG. We serve our customers through a network of approximately 600 company-owned and independent distributor locations and approximately 6,500 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories.
Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Components, Power Generation and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. Our engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as in various industrial applications, including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military equipment. The Components segment sells filtration products, aftertreatment, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMsthroughout the world.
Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction and general industrial markets. Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions. Our sales may also be impacted by OEM inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages. Economic downturns in markets we serve 33 Table of Contents generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products. As a worldwide business, our operations are also affected by currency, political, economic and regulatory matters, including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards, in the countries we serve. As part of our growth strategy, we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as China, Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia and countries in the Middle East and Africa. At the same time, our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results.
The global economy continued to slow throughout 2012, although the impacts were partially offset by strong demand across several end markets in the U.S. and Canada (North America) in the first half of the year; however these markets weakened in the second half of the year, particularly the heavy-duty truck market. Economies in emerging markets, including China and Brazil experienced challenges throughout the year in most markets, especially the off-highway construction market in China and the medium-duty truck market in Brazil. Demand in India remained strong for power generation equipment; however, improved volumes were more than offset by unfavorable currency impacts. International (excludes the U.S. and Canada) off-highway construction markets have continued to deteriorate with engine shipments down 53percent, including a 72percent decline in China. The on-highway medium-duty truck market in Brazil declined as the result of the 2011 pre-buy ahead of the new 2012 emission requirements and one of our customers replacing our B6.7 engine with a proprietary engine in 2012 contributing to international medium-duty truck shipments being down 19percent. North American demand for heavy-duty on-highway products increased 3percent while medium-duty truck shipments increased 15percent in 2012 compared to 2011; although demand in both of these markets declined in the second half of 2012. North American light-duty on-highway demand also improved with an increase in shipments to Chrysler of 37percent in 2012 compared to 2011.
Slow growth in the U.S. economy and uncertainty driven by unresolved federal tax and budget issues caused businesses to hold back on capital expenditures in 2012, thus impacting demand for truck and power generation equipment. The governments of China and India have controlled inflation through tight monetary policies in the form of rising interest rates and tightening access to credit, although both countries began easing these policies in response to reduced inflationary concerns in 2012. Brazil also began easing their monetary policies in the second half of 2012. Easing monetary policies could enhance our end markets; however, there likely will be a delay between when these policies are implemented and when our end markets respond. The European economy remains uncertain with continued volatility in the Euro countries. Although we do not have any significant direct exposure to European sovereign debt, we generated approximately 8percent of our net sales from Euro zone countries in 2012. As a result of a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in mid-2012, continued weak economic data in a number of regions and increasing levels of uncertainty regarding the direction of the global economy, we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives in the second half of 2012. In October 2012, we announced strategic actions necessary to respond to the current environment by cutting costs while maintaining investments in key growth programs. Actions include a number of measures to reduce costs including planned work week reductions, shutdowns at some manufacturing facilities and some targeted workforce reductions. We reduced our workforce by 1,300 people in the fourth quarter and incurred total restructuring charges of $52million ($35million after-tax), or $0.18 per diluted share.
34 Table of Contents The following table contains sales and EBIT results by operating segment for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011. Refer to the section titled "Operating Segment Results" for a more detailed discussion of net sales and EBIT by operating segment including the reconciliation of segment EBIT to income before taxes.

Net income attributable to CumminsInc. for 2012 was $1,645million, or $8.67 per diluted share, on sales of $17.3billion, compared to 2011 net income attributable to CumminsInc. of $1,848million, or $9.55 per diluted share, on sales of $18.0billion. The decrease in income and earnings per share was driven by higher operating expenses, lower gross margins and lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate of 23.5percent versus 27.1percent in 2011. In addition, the significant gains we recorded in 2011 for the disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and light-duty filtration business and flood damage recoveries did not repeat in 2012. Diluted earnings per share for 2012 benefited $0.06 from lower shares primarily due to the stock repurchase program.
In July 2012, we completed the acquisition of Hilite GermanyGmbH (Hilite) in a cash transaction for $176million. We also acquired an additional 45percent interest in Cummins Central Power for consideration of approximately $20million.
We generated $1.5billion of operating cash flows in 2012, compared to $2.1billion in 2011. Refer to the section titled "Operating Activities" in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.
In February 2011, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program and authorized the acquisition of up to $1billion of our common stock. We repurchased $256million of common stock in 2012. In December 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $1billion of our common stock upon completion of the 2011 repurchase program.
In July 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a dividend increase of 25percent from $0.40 to $0.50 per share on a quarterly basis effective in the third quarter. Our debt to capital ratio (capital is defined as debt plus equity) at December31, 2012, was 10.0percent, compared to 11.8percent at December31, 2011. As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form10-K, we had an 'A' credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard& Poor's Rating Services, an 'A' credit rating and a stable outlook from Fitch Ratings and a 'Baa1' credit rating with a positive outlook from Moody's Investors Service,Inc. In addition to our $1.6billion in cash and marketable securities on hand, we have sufficient access to our credit facilities, if necessary, to meet currently anticipated investment and funding needs.
35 Table of Contents On November9, 2012, we entered into a five-year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders. The credit agreement provides us with a $1.75billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are to be used by us for working capital or other general corporate purposes.
Our global pension plans, including our unfunded non-qualified plans, were 98percent funded at year-end 2012. Our U.S. qualified plan, which represents approximately 60percent of our worldwide pension obligation, was 106percent funded and our United Kingdom (U.K.) plan was 104percent funded. Asset returns in 2012 for the U.S. qualified plan were 14percent while the year-end 2012 discount rate was 3.95percent, down 0.85percentage points from the 2011 discount rate of 4.80percent. We expect to contribute $170million of cash to our global pension plans in 2013. We do not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for our U.S. plans in 2013. We expect pension and other postretirement benefit expense in 2013 to increase by approximately $35million pre-tax, or $0.14 per diluted share, when compared to 2012. Refer to application of critical accounting estimates within MD&A and Note12, "PENSION AND OTHER POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS," to the Consolidated Financial Statements , for additional information concerning our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.
2013 OUTLOOK Near-Term The global economy continued to slow throughout 2012, although the impacts were partially offset by strong demand across several end markets in North America in the first half of the year; however these markets weakened in the second half of the year, particularly the heavy-duty truck market. Economies in emerging markets, including China and Brazil experienced challenges throughout the year in most markets, especially the off-highway construction market in China and the medium-duty truck market in Brazil. Demand in India remained strong for power generation equipment; however, improved volumes were more than offset by unfavorable currency impacts.
We currently expect the following positive trends in 2013:  The Brazilian economy is expected to experience stronger growth in 2013 which is anticipated to result in improving demand in both truck and industrial markets over 2012 levels.
Demand in some of our markets is expected to improve in the second half of 2013 following a slower start in the first half of the year.
The new heavy-duty supply agreement with Navistar International Corporation is expected to have a positive impact on our heavy-duty truck engine and component sales.
We currently expect the following challenges to our business that may reduce our earnings potential in 2013:  Political decisions in the U.S. regarding federal tax and budget issues could continue to create economic uncertainty that may limit capital investments and negatively impact the overall North American economy in the first half of 2013.
We expect most of our markets to be weak in the first quarter of 2013 but should begin to improve in the second quarter, although remaining below 2012 levels in the first half of 2013.
Demand in certain European markets could continue to decline due to economic uncertainty.
Growth in international markets could be negatively impacted if emission regulations are not strictly enforced.
Demand for our products in certain industrial markets in China could remain low due to high equipment inventory levels.
36 Table of Contents  Currency volatility could continue to put pressure on earnings.
North American oil and gas markets could continue to remain weak.
Domestic and international mining markets could continue to deteriorate if commodity prices weaken.
Long-Term We believe that, over the longer term, there will be economic improvements in most of our current markets and that our opportunities for long-term profitable growth will continue in the future as the result of the following four macroeconomic trends that will benefit our businesses:  tightening emissions controls across the world;  infrastructure needs in emerging markets;  energy availability and cost issues and  globalization of industries like ours.

Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales by 2percent.
Power Generation segment sales decreased by 7percent due to lower demand in the generator technologies, power solutions and power systems businesses, which were partially offset by growing demand in the power product business, especially in North America.
Components segment sales, excluding acquisitions, decreased by 2percent due to $126million of sales in 2011 related to assets sold in 2011 and lower demand in the turbo technologies, filtration and fuel systems businesses, which were partially offset by higher demand in the emission solutions business, primarily in North America and Brazil.
The decreases above were partially offset as Distribution segment sales, excluding acquisitions, increased by 2percent due to higher demand for parts and filtration products especially in North and Central America, increased power generation growth in East Asia, increased demand in the South Pacific and higher service demand from South Pacific mining customers, which were partially offset by lower engine product sales due to a slowdown in the North American oil and gas markets.
A more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section.
Sales to international markets were 49percent of total net sales in 2012, compared with 56percent of total net sales in 2011.
Gross Margin Gross margin decreased by $81million and as a percentage of sales increased by 0.6percentage points. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales was primarily due to lower material costs, improved price realization, lower warranty costs and favorable product mix, which were partially offset by lower volumes, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations and restructuring charges of $29million.
The provision for warranties issued as a percentage of sales was 2.1percent in both 2012 and 2011. A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher consulting of $45million, restructuring and other charges of $20million and an increase of $19million in compensation and related expenses, which were partially offset by reduced discretionary spending in the 38 Table of Contents second half of the year. Higher compensation expense was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives launched prior to a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in mid-2012. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2012 performance decreased $87million over variable compensation related to 2011 performance. In the third quarter of 2012, we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives to align our cost structure with the slowdown in demand at several of our key markets in the second half of the year. Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 11.0percent in 2012 from 10.2percent in 2011.
Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $54million in compensation and related expenses and increased consulting of $32million. Higher compensation expense was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2012 performance decreased $25million over variable compensation related to 2011 performance. Research, development and engineering expenses in 2012 also included restructuring and other charges of $3million. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 4.2percent in 2012 from 3.5percent in 2011. Research activities continue to focus on development of new products to meet future emission standards around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance.
Equity, Royalty and Interest Income From Investees Equity, royalty and interest income from investees decreased primarily due to the following: In millions 2012 vs. 2011 Increase/(Decrease) Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company,Ltd. (DCEC) $ (28 ) Chongqing Cummins Engine Company,Ltd. (CCEC) (7 ) Beijing Foton Cummins EngineCo.,Ltd.

Gain on Sale of Businesses In the second quarter of 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business which manufactures exhaust products and select components for emission systems for a variety of applications not core to our other product offerings. This business was historically included in our Components segment. The sales price was $123million. We recognized a gain on the sale of $68million ($37million after-tax), which included a goodwill allocation of $19million. The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December31, 2011.
Sales for this business were $62million and $171million in 2011 (through closing) and 2010, respectively. Income before income taxes for this business were approximately $9million and $22million in 2011 (through closing) and 2010, respectively.
39 Table of Contents During the fourth quarter of 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our light-duty filtration business which manufactures light-duty automotive and industrial filtration solutions. The sales price was $90million and included a note receivable from the buyer of approximately $1million. There are no earnouts or other contingencies associated with the sales price. We recognized a gain on the sale of $53million ($33million after-tax), which included a goodwill allocation of $6million. The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December31, 2011.
Sales for this business were $64million and $74million in 2011 (through closing) and 2010, respectively. Income before income taxes for this business were approximately $13million and $9million in 2011 (through closing) and 2010, respectively.
In the second quarter of 2012, we recorded an additional $6million gain ($4million after-tax) related to final purchase price adjustments for our 2011 divestitures. The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December31, 2012.

Income Tax Expense Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35percent U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2012 was 23.5percent compared to 27.1percent for 2011. Our 2012 income tax provision includes a one-time $134million tax benefit resulting from transactions entered into and tax return elections made with respect to our U.K. operations. Our 2011 income tax provision includes a tax benefit of $48million related to prior year refund claims filed for additional research tax credits, as well as additional foreign income and related foreign tax credits, net of related tax reserves. Our effective tax rate for 2011 also includes a tax benefit of $19million related to the release of deferred U.S. tax liabilities on certain foreign earnings, as a result of restructuring our foreign operations. Also included in 2011 is a tax benefit of $16million resulting from the reduction of our unrecognized tax benefits primarily due to settlements with taxing authorities. The 2011 income tax provision also includes other tax items totaling to a $2million net tax charge, primarily relating to the enactment of state law changes in Indiana and changes in the U.K. as well as adjustments to our income tax accounts based on our 2010 tax return filings.
On January2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was enacted. This legislation retroactively extended the U.S. federal research credit for two years, from January1, 2012, through December31, 2013. We expect our 2013 effective tax rate, which will include an estimated 1percent benefit for the 2013 research credit, to be 26percent excluding any one-time items that may arise. Additionally, we anticipate that our first quarter 2013 results will include a one-time tax benefit of approximately $28million representing the net benefit attributable to the 2012 research credit. Earnings of our China operations generated after December31, 2011, are considered to be permanently reinvested and additional U.S. deferred tax is no longer being provided on these earnings generated after 2011. We have $702million of retained earnings and related cumulative translation adjustments in our China operations generated prior to December31, 2011 and have provided a U.S. deferred tax liability of $158million relating to these earnings and related translation adjustments. We anticipate that these earnings will be distributed to the U.S. within the next five years.
41 Table of Contents Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to non-Cummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities. Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased primarily due to a decline of $5million at Wuxi Cummins Turbo TechnologiesCo.Ltd., $3million at Cummins Western CanadaLP. and $3million at Power Systems India. The decreases were partially offset by an increase of $6million at Cummins Power SolutionsLtd. and $2million at Cummins Central PowerLLC.
Net Income Attributable to CumminsInc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to CumminsInc.
Net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to CumminsInc. decreased primarily due to lower volumes, particularly in the international construction and medium-duty truck markets, higher research, development and engineering expenses, higher selling, general and administrative expenses and lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees. These decreases were partially offset by improved gross margin as a percentage of sales and a lower effective tax rate of 23.5percent versus 27.1percent in 2011. In addition, the significant gains we recorded in 2011 for the disposition of certain asset and liabilities of our exhaust business and light-duty filtration business and flood damage recoveries from the insurance settlement regarding a June 2008 flood in Southern Indiana did not repeat in 2012. Diluted earnings per share for 2012 also benefited $0.06 from lower shares primarily due to the stock repurchase program.
2011 vs. 2010 Net Sales Sales increased in all segments primarily due to increased demand from most markets including recovery of the North American on-highway markets. The primary drivers for the increase in sales were:  Engine segment sales increased by 43percent due to increased demand in all lines of business led by heavy-duty truck, industrial and medium-duty truck and bus businesses.
Components segment sales increased by 33percent due to increased demand in all lines of business led by emission solutions and turbo technologies businesses.
Power Generation segment sales increased by 20percent due to increased demand in all lines of business led by commercial products and generator technologies businesses and improved price realization.
Distribution segment sales increased by 31percent due to increased demand in all product lines and all geographic regions led by Asia Pacific, North and Central America, Europe and Middle East regions.
A more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section.
Sales to international markets were 56percent of total net sales in 2011, compared with 60percent of total net sales in 2010.
Gross Margin Gross margin increased by $1,421million and as a percentage of sales increased by 1.4percentage points. The significant improvement was led by increases in volume, improved price realization, higher product content on certain products and favorable currency impacts, partially offset by higher material costs, higher commodity costs and higher base warranty costs due to increased volumes and increasing 42 Table of Contents mix of EPA 2010 products. Gross margin in 2010 also benefited from a one-time $32million tax recovery in Brazil. See Note14, "COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES," in our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
The provision for warranties issued as a percentage of sales in 2011 was 2.1percent compared to 3.0percent in 2010. Accrual rates for engines sold this year were generally lower than the rates charged in prior years as our warranty costs for EPA 2010 products have been lower than expected. A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $174million in compensation and related expenses including increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives, merit increases and increased discretionary spending. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2011 performance increased $42million over variable compensation related to 2010 performance. Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased from 11.2percent in 2010 to 10.2percent in 2011.
Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $79million in compensation and related expenses, an increase in the number of engineering programs with increased costs of $79million and increased discretionary spending. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2011 performance increased $8million over variable compensation related to 2010 performance. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 3.5percent in 2011 from 3.1percent in 2010. Research activities continue to focus on development of new products to meet future emission standards around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance.
Equity, Royalty and Interest Income From Investees Equity, royalty and interest income from investees increased primarily due to the following: In millions 2011 vs. 2010 Increase/(Decrease) North American distributors $ 33 Chongqing Cummins Engine Company,Ltd.

Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased primarily due to a decline of $9million at Wuxi Cummins Turbo TechnologiesCo.Ltd. and $4million at Cummins IndiaLtd., a publicly traded company on various exchanges in India. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $6million at Cummins Western CanadaLP, $4million at Cummins Power SystemsLLC and $1million at Cummins NortheastLLC.
45 Table of Contents Net Income Attributable to CumminsInc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to CumminsInc.
Net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to CumminsInc. increased primarily due to higher volumes in most markets and geographic regions, including the recovery of the North American on-highway truck markets, significantly improved gross margins, the gain on disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business, a lower effective tax rate, increased equity income and the gain related to flood damage recoveries from the insurance settlement regarding a June 2008 flood in Southern Indiana. These favorable drivers were partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses in 2011 as compared to 2010. Diluted earnings per share for 2011 also benefited $0.17 from lower shares primarily due to the stock repurchase program.
RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES We have executed restructuring actions primarily in the form of involuntary separation programs in the fourth quarter of 2012. These actions were in response to deterioration in our U.S. businesses and most key markets around the world in the second half of 2012, as well as a reduction in orders in most U.S. and global markets for 2013. We reduced our worldwide professional workforce by approximately 650 employees, or 3percent. We also reduced our hourly workforce by approximately 650 employees. During 2012, we incurred a pre-tax charge related to the professional and hourly workforce reductions of approximately $49million.
Employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. Estimates of restructuring were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded and we may need to revise previous estimates.
We incurred a $1million charge for lease terminations and a $2million charge for asset impairments and other non-cash charges. During 2012, we recorded restructuring and other charges of $52million ($35million after-tax). These restructuring actions included: In millions Year ended December31, 2012 Workforce reductions $ 49 Exit activities 1 Other 2 Restructuring and other charges $ 52 If the 2012 restructuring actions are successfully implemented, we expect the annualized savings from the professional actions to be approximately $39million. Our charge related to the professional actions was approximately $32million. Approximately 32percent of the savings from the restructuring actions will be realized in cost of sales, 53percent in selling, general and administrative expenses and 15percent in research, development and engineering expenses. We expect the accrual to be paid in cash which will be funded with cash generated from operations.
At December31, 2012, of the approximately 1,300 employees to be affected by this plan, 1,130 had been terminated.

We use segment EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, taxes and noncontrolling interests) as a primary basis for the chief operating decision-maker to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments. Segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments.
47 Table of Contents The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in our Consolidated Financial Statements . We prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We have allocated certain common costs and expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal and finance. We also do not allocate debt-related items, actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, changes in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance, flood damage gains or losses, divestiture gains or losses or income taxes to individual segments. In 2012, non-segment items included a $20million reserve ($12million after-tax) related to legal matters and a $6million gain related to adjustments from our 2011 divestitures, while 2011 included the gain on disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business and 2010 included a Brazil revenue tax recovery. These gains were not allocated to the businesses as they were not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year. Segment EBIT may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.
Following is a discussion of operating results for each of our business segments.

The following are the primary drivers by market:  Industrial market sales decreased primarily due to a 53percent decline in construction engine shipments in international markets, including a 72percent decline in China, and a 44percent decline in engine shipments to the North American oil and gas markets due to weakened natural gas prices, which were partially offset by a 4percent increase in engine shipments in the North American construction market.
Medium-duty truck and bus sales decreased primarily due to lower demand in the Brazilian truck market due to pre-buy activity in the second half of 2011 ahead of the implementation of Euro V emission regulations in the first quarter of 2012 and one of our customers replacing our B6.7 engine with a proprietary engine in 2012. The B6.7 engine replacement was partially offset by the 2012 launch of our ISF and 9 liter engines in new light-duty on-highway and medium-duty truck applications, respectively, with this same customer. The decrease was further offset by improved demand in North American markets.
The decreases above were partially offset by the following:  Heavy-duty truck engine sales increased due to growth in the North American on-highway markets in the first half of the year, primarily as a result of the replacement of aging fleets.
Light-duty automotive and RV sales increased primarily due to a 37percent improvement in units shipped to Chrysler.
49 Table of Contents Total on-highway-related sales for 2012 were 59percent of total engine segment sales, compared to 56percent in 2011.
Segment EBIT Engine segment EBIT decreased versus 2011, primarily due to lower gross margin, lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees, higher research, development and engineering expenses and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Engine segment EBIT for 2012 included restructuring and other charges of $20million in the fourth quarter. Changes in Engine segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December31, 2012 vs. 2011 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ (82 ) (3 )% 0.3 Selling, general and administrative expenses (8 ) (1 )% (0.4 ) Research, development and engineering expenses (36 ) (9 )% (0.5 ) Equity, royalty and interest income from investees (39 ) (23 )% (0.3 ) The decrease in gross margin versus 2011 was primarily due to lower volumes and restructuring and other charges, which was partially offset by improved price realization, lower material costs, favorable product mix and improved product coverage. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives launched prior to a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in mid-2012, partially offset by decreased variable compensation expense. The increase in research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to new product development spending and increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. The decrease in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to weaker demand for on-highway products at DCEC.
2011 vs. 2010 Sales Engine segment sales increased in all businesses versus 2010, as demand improved in most markets including a significant rebound in North American on-highway markets, improvements in international construction markets, increased demand in global mining markets and significant increases in oil and gas markets. The following are the primary drivers by market:  Heavy-duty truck engine sales increased due to recovery in North American on-highway markets as OEM customers replaced their aging fleets and the depletion of transition engine inventory purchased in 2009 in advance of the EPA's 2010 emission standard changes.
Industrial market sales increased primarily due to a 26percent improvement in international construction engine shipments driven by the economic recovery and infrastructure improvements in certain emerging markets, increased demand in advance of off-highway emission regulations in the U.S. and Europe, a 46percent increase in units sold in the global mining engine markets due to increased coal and commodity demands and more than double the number of oil and gas engine shipments in North America.
Medium-duty truck and bus sales increased primarily due to the recovery in North American on-highway markets, the depletion of transition engine inventory purchased in 2009 in advance of the EPA's 2010 emissions change and higher demand in the Brazilian truck engine market driven by a growing economy.
50 Table of Contents Total on-highway-related sales for 2011 were 56percent of total engine segment sales, compared to 50percent in 2010.
Segment EBIT Engine segment EBIT increased significantly versus 2010, primarily due to higher gross margin, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses. Changes in Engine segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December31, 2011 vs. 2010 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ 864 55 % 1.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses (142 ) (22 )% 1.2 Research, development and engineering expenses (134 ) (51 )% (0.2 ) Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 5 3 % (0.5 ) The increase in gross margin versus 2010 was primarily due to higher volumes, improved price realization and favorable mix, partially offset by higher commodity costs and higher base warranty costs due to increased volumes and increasing mix of EPA 2010 products. Although our warranty costs increased, our warranty cost as a percentage of sales decreased as actual accrual rates for engines sold this year were generally lower than rates charged in prior years as our warranty costs for EPA 2010 engines have been lower than expected. The increases in selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses were primarily due to new product development spending and increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. The increase in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to strong demand for power generation and mining products in China with CCEC and strong export sales to Russia and Brazil in the midrange on-highway market with Beijing Foton Cummins EngineCo.,Ltd., which was partially offset by lower sales at DCEC due to weaker demand in the on-highway heavy-duty and medium-duty truck market in China.

The following are the primary drivers:  Turbo technologies business sales decreased primarily due to a decline in OEM sales in Europe and China, reduced aftermarket demand and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, which were partially offset by higher OEM demand in North America in the first half of the year.
Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales results.
52 Table of Contents  Filtration business sales decreased primarily as a result of the disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our light-duty filtration business and our exhaust business in 2011 and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. Disposition related sales were $71million in 2011. The decreases were partially offset by increased aftermarket demand in the first half of the year.
Fuel systems business sales decreased primarily due to lower European demand and reduced aftermarket demand, which were partially offset by improved demand in North American on-highway markets in the first half of the year.
The decreases above were partially offset by the emission solutions business as sales increased primarily due to higher demand in the North American on-highway market in the first half of the year and new sales in the Brazilian on-highway market as the result of new emission requirements effective January1, 2012, partially offset by lower sales due to the disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business in the second quarter of 2011, lower price realization and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. Disposition related sales were $55million in 2011.
Segment EBIT Components segment EBIT decreased versus 2011, primarily due to higher research, development and engineering expenses.

The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives launched prior to a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in mid-2012, partially offset by decreased variable compensation expense and lower discretionary spending in the second half of 2012. The increase in research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to new product development spending and increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives.
53 Table of Contents 2011 vs. 2010 Sales Components segment sales increased in all businesses versus 2010. The following are the primary regional drivers by business:  Emission solutions business sales increased due to the increased sales volume of North American EPA 2010 aftertreatment systems and increased demand for Euro V aftertreatment systems in Europe, which were partially offset by lower sales due to the sale of the exhaust business.
Turbo technologies business sales increased due to higher OEM demand in North America, Europe, India and Brazil and improved aftermarket demand.
Fuel systems business sales increased primarily due to improved demand in North American on-highway markets.
Filtration business sales increased due to improved aftermarket demand, especially in Asia Pacific and Europe, higher OEM demand due to the recovery in North American on-highway markets and favorable foreign currency impacts which were partially offset by lower sales due to the disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust and light-duty filtration businesses.

59 Table of Contents 2012 vs. 2011 Sales Distribution segment sales, excluding the acquisitions, increased versus 2011 due to higher demand in the parts and filtration, power generation and service businesses, partially offset by lower demand in the engine business. The following were the primary drivers by line of business:  Parts and filtration product sales increased primarily due to higher demand in North and Central America and the Middle East.
Power generation product sales increased primarily due to growth in East Asia and improved demand in the South Pacific, which were partially offset by a reduction in nonrecurring project-related sales in the Middle East.
Service revenue increased primarily due to higher demand from mining customers in the South Pacific and higher volumes in East Asia and Europe.
The increases above were partially offset by the following:  Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales results.
Engine product sales decreased primarily due to a significant slowdown in the North American oil and gas markets and lower demand in Europe as a result of pre-buy activity in the second half of 2011 ahead of the 2012 emissions change for certain construction engines, which were partially offset by growth in East Asia.
Segment EBIT Distribution segment EBIT decreased versus 2011, primarily due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses and higher research, development and engineering expenses, which were partially offset by higher equity, royalty and interest income from investees and higher gross margin. Distribution segment EBIT for 2012 included restructuring and other charges of $14million in the fourth quarter. Changes in Distribution segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December31, 2012 vs. 2011 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Including acquisitions Gross margin $ 11 2 % (1.2 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (46 ) (10 )% (0.3 ) Research, development and engineering expenses (3 ) (100 )% (0.1 ) Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 16 9 %  Excluding acquisitions Gross margin (18 ) (3 )% (1.1 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (23 ) (5 )% (0.4 ) Segment EBIT Excluding Acquisitions The decrease in gross margin versus 2011 was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts, unfavorable variations in geographic mix and restructuring and other charges, which were partially offset by higher volumes in most products. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives launched 60 Table of Contents prior to a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in mid-2012, partially offset by decreased variable compensation expense and lower discretionary spending in the second half of 2012. The increase in research, development and engineering expenses was mainly due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. The increase in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to increased income from North American distributors.
2011 vs. 2010 Sales Distribution segment sales increased for all product lines versus 2010. The following were the primary drivers by line of business:  Engine product sales increased primarily due to growth in the oil and gas markets in North and Central America, improved demand in certain markets in Europe, partially driven by pre-buy activity ahead of the 2012 emissions change and higher demand in Africa.
Power generation product sales increased primarily due to improved project-based business across North and Central America, South Pacific, Middle East and Europe, increased demand from Japan's earthquake recovery and the acquisition of a previously independent distributor in 2010.
Parts and filtration product sales increased primarily due to higher demand in North and Central America, the acquisition of a previously independent distributor in 2010, higher demand from mining customers in the South Pacific, improved sales in East Asia as the result of overall market recovery and increasing engine populations and higher demand driven by economic recovery in Europe.
Foreign currency fluctuations also favorably impacted sales.
Segment EBIT Distribution segment EBIT increased versus 2010, primarily due to improved gross margin and equity, royalty and interest income from investees, which was partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBIT was also unfavorably impacted by the absence of a one-time gain of $12million from the acquisition of Cummins Western Canada in 2010. Changes in Distribution segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December31, 2011 vs. 2010 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ 161 31 % 0.1 Selling, general and administrative expenses (108 ) (30 )% 0.1 Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 40 30 %  The increase in gross margin versus 2010 was primarily due to higher volumes in most products, favorable foreign currency impacts and the acquisition of a previously independent distributor in 2010. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was mainly due to higher headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. The increase in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to higher income from North American distributors, especially in the oil and gas markets, and increased parts sales.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Management's Assessment of Liquidity Our financial condition and liquidity remain strong. Our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit.
We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. We generate significant ongoing cash flow, which has been used, in part, to fund capital expenditures, pay dividends on our common stock, fund repurchases of common stock and make acquisitions. Cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity. As of December31, 2012, other sources of liquidity included:  cash and cash equivalents of $1.4billion, of which approximately 24percent was located in the U.S. and 76percent was located primarily in the U.K., China, Singapore, India and Brazil,  marketable securities of $247million, which were located primarily in India and Brazil and the majority of which could be liquidated into cash within a few days,  revolving credit facility with $1.7billion available, net of outstanding letters of credit and  international and other domestic short-term credit facilities with $301million available.
We believe our liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital, capital expenditures, projected pension obligations, dividend payments, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, restructuring actions and debt service obligations.
62 Table of Contents Our new revolving credit agreement, completed in the fourth quarter of 2012, provides us with a $1.75billion unsecured revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are to be used for our general corporate purposes. See Note10, "DEBT" to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The credit agreement includes one financial covenant: a leverage ratio. The required leverage ratio, which measures the sum of total debt plus securitization financing to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the four fiscal quarters may not exceed 3.25 to 1.0. At December31, 2012, our leverage ratio was 0.30 to 1.0.
A significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the U.S. As of December31, 2012, the total of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $1.3billion, the vast majority of which was located in the U.K., China, India, Singapore and Brazil. The geographic location of our cash and marketable securities aligns well with our business growth strategy. We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. As a result, we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our targeted expansion or operating needs with local resources.
If we distribute our foreign cash balances to the U.S. or to other foreign subsidiaries, we could be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes. For example, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes if we repatriated cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings we have asserted are permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. Foreign earnings for which we assert permanent reinvestment outside the U.S. consist primarily of earnings of our U.K. domiciled subsidiaries. At present, we do not foresee a need to repatriate any earnings from these subsidiaries for which we have asserted permanent reinvestment. However, to help fund cash needs of the U.S. or other international subsidiaries as they arise, we repatriate available cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are not permanently reinvested when it is cost effective to do so. Our 2012 and subsequent earnings from our China operations are considered permanently reinvested, while earnings generated prior to 2012, for which U.S. deferred tax liabilities have been recorded, are expected to be repatriated in future years.
We continuously monitor our pension assets and believe that we have limited exposure to the European debt crisis. No sovereign debt instruments of crisis countries are held in the trusts, while any equities are held with large well-diversified multinational firms or are de minimis amounts in large index funds. Our pension plans have not experienced any significant impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets.
The maturity schedule of our existing long-term debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term. Required annual principal payments range from $13million to $72million over each of the next five years.
Working Capital Summary We fund our working capital with cash from operations and short-term borrowings when necessary. Various assets and liabilities, including short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month 63 Table of Contents depending on short-term liquidity needs. As a result, working capital is a prime focus of management attention.

Current liabilities decreased 14percent primarily due to lower accounts payable as a result of reduced purchasing volumes, a decrease in accrued compensation, benefits and retirement costs due to lower variable compensation expense for 2012 and a decrease in taxes payable caused by lower earnings and higher estimated tax payments in 2012 compared to 2011.
Days' sales in receivables increased five days compared to 2011. The increase was due to higher average receivable balances throughout 2012 on lower sales due to the decline in volume over the second half of the year.
Inventory turnover decreased 0.6 turns compared to 2011. The decrease was due to higher average inventory balances throughout 2012 on lower sales due to the decline in volume over the second half of the year.
64 Table of Contents Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents decreased $115million during the year ended December31, 2012, compared to an increase of $461million during the comparable period in 2011.

During 2012, the net increase in working capital resulted in a cash outflow of $775million compared to a cash outflow of $154million in 2011. This change of $621million was primarily driven by lower accrued expenses and a decrease in accounts payable, as volumes dropped in the second half of the year, and higher cash tax payments of approximately $159million. These were partially offset by a decrease in accounts and notes receivable and a smaller increase in inventory in 2012.
65 Table of Contents Pensions The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets, market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans. In 2012, the return for our U.S. plan was 14percent while our U.K. plan return exceeded 7percent. Approximately 76percent of our pension plan assets are held in highly liquid investments such as equity and fixed income securities. The remaining 24percent of our plan assets are held in less liquid, but market valued investments, including real estate, private equity and insurance contracts. We made $132million of pension contributions in 2012. Claims and premiums for other postretirement benefits approximated $41million, net of reimbursements, in 2012. The $132million of pension contributions in 2012 included voluntary contributions of $110million. These contributions and payments include payments from our funds either to increase pension plan assets or to make direct payments to plan participants. We anticipate making total contributions of $170million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2013. Expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2013 will meet or exceed the current funding requirements.
2011 vs. 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities increased versus 2010 primarily due to significantly higher consolidated net income, excluding the gain on the sale of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business, as a result of higher sales volumes, higher dividends from equity investees and favorable working capital fluctuations. During 2011, the net increase in working capital resulted in a cash outflow of $154million compared to a cash outflow of $245million in 2010. This decrease of $91million was primarily driven by a smaller increase in inventory in 2011 as we significantly increased inventory levels in 2010 to meet anticipated post-recession demand.
Investing Activities Change Years ended December31, 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 In millions 2012 2011 2010 Capital expenditures $ (690 ) $ (622 ) $ (364 ) $ (68 ) $ (258 ) Investments in internal use software (87 ) (60 ) (43 ) (27 ) (17 ) Proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment 11 8 55 3 (47 ) Investments in and advances to equity investees (70 ) (81 ) (2 ) 11 (79 ) Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired (215 )  (104 ) (215 ) 104 Proceeds from sale of businesses, net of cash sold 10 199  (189 ) 199 Investments in marketable securities-acquisitions (561 ) (729 ) (823 ) 168 94 Investments in marketable securities-liquidations 585 750 690 (165 ) 60 Proceeds from sale of equity investment 23   23  Purchases of other investments   (62 )  62 Cash flows from derivatives not designated as hedges 12 (18 ) 2 30 (20 ) Other, net  1  (1 ) 1 Net cash used in investing activities $ (982 ) $ (552 ) $ (651 ) $ (430 ) $ 99 2012 vs. 2011 Net cash used in investing activities increased versus 2011 primarily due to cash investments for the acquisitions of Hilite and Cummins Central Power, proceeds from the 2011 disposition of certain 66 Table of Contents assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and light-duty filtration business, which did not repeat in 2012, and increased capital expenditures.
Capital expenditures were $690million in 2012 compared to $622million in 2011. Despite the challenging economies around the world, we continue to invest in new product lines and targeted capacity expansions. We plan to spend approximately $850million in 2013 as we continue with product launches and facility improvements and prepare for future emission standards. Over one-half of our capital expenditures will be invested outside of the U.S. in 2013.
2011 vs. 2010 Net cash used in investing activities decreased versus 2010 primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business (See Note2, "ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES" to our Consolidated Financial Statements ), decreased acquisitions and increased liquidations of marketable securities, the acquisition of Cummins Western Canada in 2010 and decreased purchases of other investments. These drivers were partially offset by increased capital expenditures, additional investments in and advances to equity investees and lower proceeds from dispositions of property, plant and equipment.

Our total debt was $775million as of December31, 2012, compared with $783million as of December31, 2011. Total debt as a percent of our total capital, including total long-term debt, was 10.0percent at December31, 2012, compared with 11.8percent at December31, 2011.
2011 vs. 2010 Net cash used in financing activities increased versus 2010, primarily due to significantly higher repurchases of common stock, increased payments on borrowings and capital lease obligations, decreased proceeds from borrowings and higher dividend payments.

Declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon our income and liquidity position, among other factors, and is subject to declaration by our Board of Directors, who meet quarterly to consider our dividend payment. We expect to fund dividend payments with cash from operations.
Credit Ratings A number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements, such as our revolving credit facility, have restrictive covenants and/or pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating. There were no downgrades of our credit ratings in 2012 that have impacted these covenants or pricing modifications. In September 2011, Standard& Poor's Rating Services upgraded our rating to 'A' and changed our outlook to stable. In November 2011, Moody's Investors Service,Inc. raised our rating to 'Baa1' and changed our outlook to positive. In October 2012, Fitch Ratings upgraded our ratings to 'A' and changed our outlook to stable.
Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, are subject to change and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. In addition, we undertake no obligation to update disclosures concerning our credit ratings, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Our ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies as of the date of filing are shown in the table below.

(2) We are contractually obligated in the U.K. to fund $37million in 2013 and $149million from 2014 to 2015; however, our expected total pension contributions for 2013, including the U.K., is approximately $170million.
The contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of $145million as of December31, 2012. We are not able to reasonably estimate the period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur. See Note4, "INCOME TAXES," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
Our other commercial commitments as of December31, 2012, are as follows: Other Commercial Commitments 2013 2014 - 2015 2016 - 2017 After 2017 Total In millions Standby letters of credit under revolving credit agreement $ 23 $  $  $  $ 23 International and other domestic letters of credit 27 18  2 47 Performance and excise bonds 14 52 3 1 70 Guarantees, indemnifications and other commitments 3 13   16 Total $ 67 $ 83 $ 3 $ 3 $ 156 APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note1, "SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES," of our Consolidated Financial Statements which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives.
Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP which often requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. Management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements.
70 Table of Contents Critical accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs, recoverability of investment related to new products, accounting for income taxes and pension benefits.
Warranty Programs We estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold. Our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management's best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable, which generally occurs when it is announced. Our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates, repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle. Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch, with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch. We generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding product's warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation. We then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters, and new product specific experience thereafter. Note11, "PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY," to our Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2012 and 2011 including adjustments to pre-existing warranties.
Recoverability of Investment Related to New Products At December31, 2012, we have capitalized $233million associated with the future launch of our new light-duty diesel engine product. Development of this product began in 2006. Market uncertainty related to the global recession that began in 2008 resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs. At December31, 2009, we reviewed our investment of $216million for possible impairment. We used projections to assess whether future cash flows on an undiscounted basis related to the assets are likely to exceed the related carrying amount to determine if a write-down was appropriate. These projections required estimates about product volume and the size of the market for vehicles that are not yet developed. We used input from our customers in developing alternative cash flow scenarios. Our analysis indicated that the assets were recoverable. Customers that are expected to purchase sufficient quantities to recover our investment in the new light-duty diesel engine products remained active with the development of this product through 2012, and there were no significant changes to the assumptions used in 2009. If customer expectations or projected volumes deteriorate and we do not identify alternative customers and/or product applications, we could be required to write-down these assets to net realizable value.
71 Table of Contents Accounting for Income Taxes We determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December31, 2012, we recorded net deferred tax assets of $396million. These assets included $165million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $95million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. A more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in Note4, "INCOME TAXES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements .
Pension Benefits We sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the U.S. and the U.K. and to a lesser degree in various other countries. In the U.S. and the U.K. we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded. We account for our pension programs in accordance with employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under GAAP. GAAP requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis. As a result, our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at December31. These assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover rates, actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age, mortality rates and participant withdrawals. The actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions, participant life span and withdrawal rates. These differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the future.
The expected long-term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense. We considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets. The long-term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a five-year average market value of return. Projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. As of December31, 2012, based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our U.S. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 10-year projection period equal to or in excess of 7.5percent approximately 40percent of the time while returns of 9.0percent or greater are anticipated 25percent of the time. We expect additional positive returns from active investment management. The 2012 one year return was 14percent, combined with the very favorable returns in 2011 has eliminated the significant deterioration in pension assets experienced in 2008 as a result of the credit crisis and related market recession. Based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 8.0percent per year in 2013 for U.S. pension assets is reasonable.
72 Table of Contents The methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations. As of December31, 2012, based upon our target asset allocations, it is anticipated that our U.K. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20-year projection period equal to or in excess of 5.6percent approximately 50percent of the time while returns of 6.5percent or greater are anticipated 25percent of the time. We expect additional positive returns from active investment management. The one year return for our U.K. plan exceeded 7percent for 2012 and similar to our U.S. plan, the 2008 market related deterioration in our plan assets has been eliminated. Our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long-term outlook. Therefore, the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. Based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 5.8percent in 2013 for U.K. pension assets is reasonable. Our pension plan asset allocation at December31, 2012 and 2011 and target allocation for 2013 are as follows: U.S. Plans U.K. Plans Percentage of Plan Assets at December31, Percentage of Plan Assets at December31, Target Allocation 2013 Target Allocation 2013 Investment description 2012 2011 2012 2011 Equity securities 40.0 % 40.1 % 44.2 % 40.0 % 43.0 % 45.0 % Fixed income 45.0 % 47.5 % 42.2 % 45.0 % 46.0 % 46.0 % Real estate/other 15.0 % 12.4 % 13.6 % 15.0 % 11.0 % 9.0 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years. The table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension expense for the period 2010-2012 and our expected rate of return for 2013.
Long-Term Expected Return Assumptions 2013 2012 2011 2010 U.S. Plans 8.00 % 8.00 % 8.00 % 8.00 % U.K. Plans 5.80 % 6.50 % 7.00 % 7.25 % A lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability.
GAAP for pensions offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual results. It is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences. Under the delayed recognition alternative, changes in pension obligation (including those resulting from plan amendments) and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligations are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in comprehensive income and subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods. In addition to this approach, GAAP also allows immediate recognition of actuarial gains or losses. Immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results. We have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods. If we adopted the immediate recognition approach, we would record a loss of $1,082million ($724million after-tax) for our U.S. and U.K. pension plans.
The difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and, under certain circumstances such as when the difference 73 Table of Contents exceeds 10percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation (PBO), amortized over future years of service. This is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions. As of December31, 2012, we had net pension actuarial losses of $734million and $349million for the U.S. and U.K. pension plans, respectively. Under GAAP, the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Increases in actuarial losses decreased our shareholders' equity by $83million (after-tax) in 2012. The increases were due to liability losses from reduced discount rates, partially offset by improved plan asset performance in 2012. As these amounts exceed 10percent of our PBO, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees.
The table below sets forth the net periodic pension expense for the period 2010 through 2012 and our expected expense for 2013.
Net Periodic Pension Expense In millions 2013 2012 2011 2010 Pension expense $ 97 $ 64 $ 68 $ 70 We expect 2013 pension expense to be increased significantly over 2012, due to the unfavorable impacts of higher service cost due to increased headcount, decreased discount rates and lower expected asset returns for our U.K. plan as we de-risk plan trust assets moving toward more conservative investments. The decrease in periodic pension expense in 2012 compared to 2011 was due to improved returns on assets and strong contributions in 2011. The decrease in periodic pension expense in 2011 compared to 2010 was due to improved returns on assets as the capital markets began to recover and strong contributions in 2010. Another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate. The weighted average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension expense are set forth in the table below.
Discount Rates 2013 2012 2011 2010 U.S. Plans 3.97 % 4.82 % 5.42 % 5.60 % U.K. Plans 4.70 % 5.20 % 5.80 % 5.80 % Changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation.
The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in GAAP which suggests the use of a high-quality corporate bond rate. We used bond information provided by Moody's Investor Service Inc., Standard& Poor's Rating Services, Fitch Ratings and Dominion Bond Rating. All bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the U.S. and U.K. were high-quality, non-callable bonds (Aa or better) as of December31, 2012, by at least two of the bond rating agencies. The average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to GAAP for pensions and other postretirement benefits.
Our model called for 80years of benefit payments for the U.S. plans and 60years of payments for the U.K. For both countries, our model matches the present value of the plan's projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio. A single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio. The resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan's distinct liability characteristics.
74 Table of Contents The table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2013 net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets.
In millions Impact on Pension Expense Increase (Decrease) Discount rate used to value liabilities 0.25percent increase $ (9 ) 0.25percent decrease 9 Expected rate of return on assets One percent increase (34 ) One percent decrease 34 The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. A higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense. A lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear.
Note12, "PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS," to our Consolidated Financial Statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity, the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements .
RECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended its rules regarding the presentation of comprehensive income. The objective of this amendment was to improve the comparability, consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. Specifically, this amendment requires that all non-owner changes in shareholders' equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In addition, the standard also requires disclosure of the location of reclassification adjustments between other comprehensive income and net income on the face of the financial statements. The new rules became effective for us beginning January1, 2012. In December 2011, the FASB deferred certain aspects of this standard beyond the current effective date, specifically the provisions dealing with reclassification adjustments. Because the standard only impacts the display of comprehensive income and does not impact what is included in comprehensive income, the standard did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements .
In May 2011, the FASB amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures. The objective of the amendment was to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S.GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. Primarily this amendment changed the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S.GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in addition to clarifying the Board's intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements. The new standard also requires additional disclosures related to fair value measurements categorized within Level3 of the fair value hierarchy and requires disclosure of the categorization in the hierarchy for items which are not recorded at fair value but fair value is required to be disclosed. The new rules were effective for us beginning January1, 2012. As of December31, 2012, we had no fair value measurements categorized within Level3 outside of our pension plans. The only impact for us is the disclosure of the categorization in the fair value hierarchy for those items where fair value is only disclosed (primarily our debt 75 Table of Contents obligations). Our disclosure related to the new standard is included in Note6, "FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS," to the Consolidated Financial Statements .
Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective In December 2011, the FASB amended its standards related to offsetting assets and liabilities. This amendment requires entities to disclose both gross and net information about certain instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and certain instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting agreement. This information will enable users of the financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position. The new rules will become effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. It is also required that the new disclosures are applied for all comparative periods presented. In January 2013, the FASB further amended this standard to limit its scope to derivatives, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowings and lending transactions. We do not believe this amendment will have a significant effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements . While we are still finalizing our analysis, due to the scope limitation we also do not expect any significant changes to our footnote disclosures.
In February 2013, the FASB amended its standards on comprehensive income by requiring disclosure in the footnotes of information about amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. Specifically, the amendment will require disclosure of the line items of net income in which the item was reclassified only if it is reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. It will also require cross reference to other disclosures for amounts that are not reclassified in their entirety in the same reporting period. The new disclosures will be required for us prospectively only for annual periods beginning January1, 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods.
ITEM 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. This risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swap contracts, commodity zero-cost collars and interest rate swaps. As stated in our policies and procedures, financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes, and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes. When material, we adjust the value of our derivative contracts for counter-party or our credit risk.
Further information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in Note21, "DERIVATIVES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements .
The following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analysis performed as of December31, 2012. The sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous, parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.
Foreign Exchange Rates As a result of our international business presence, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks. We transact business in foreign currencies and, as a result, our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility, we use foreign exchange forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and third-party sales and purchases denominated in non-functional currencies. Our internal policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flows for up to one year. These foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under GAAP. The effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the forward contract is deferred 76 Table of Contents and reported as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" (AOCL). When the hedged forecasted transaction (sale or purchase) occurs, the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the hedge, unrealized gain or loss, if any, is recognized in current income during the period of change. As of December31, 2012, the amount we expect to reclassify from AOCL to income over the next year is an unrealized net gain of $1million. For the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, there were no circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge.
To minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, which are considered economic hedges. The objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under GAAP.
As of December31, 2012, the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts, would be approximately $45million. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12months. The analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels. It should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items (see Note21, "DERIVATIVES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements ).
Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps. The objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk.
In November 2005, we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our $250million debt issue, due in 2028, from a fixed rate of 7.125percent to a floating rate based on a LIBOR spread. The terms of the swap mirror those of the debt, with interest paid semi-annually. This swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under GAAP. The gain or loss on this derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income as "Interest expense." The following table summarizes these gains and losses for the years presented below: For the years ended December31, 2012 2011 In millions Income Statement Classification Gain/(Loss) on Swaps Gain/(Loss) on Borrowings Gain/(Loss) on Swaps Gain/(Loss) on Borrowings Interest expense $ 6 $ (6 ) $ 41 $ (41 ) Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers. In order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and, consequently, fluctuations in gross margins, we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations. Certain commodity swap contracts are derivative contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges under GAAP. We also have commodity swap contracts that represent an economic hedge but are not designated for hedge accounting and are marked to market through earnings. For those contracts that qualify for hedge accounting, the effective 77 Table of Contents portion of the unrealized gain or loss is deferred and reported as a component of AOCL. When the hedged forecasted transaction (purchase) occurs, the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the hedge, if any, is recognized in current income in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs. As of December31, 2012, we expect to reclassify an unrealized net loss of less than $1million from AOCL to income over the next year. Our internal policy allows for managing these cash flow hedges for up to three years.
As of December31, 2012, the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity swap contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities, was $11million. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12months. The analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels. It should be noted that any change in the value of the swap contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items (see Note21, "DERIVATIVES," to the Consolidated Financial Statements ).

WARD Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 80 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of CumminsInc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CumminsInc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying "Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting." Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

86 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Operations Cummins Inc. was founded in 1919 as a corporation in Columbus, Indiana, as one of the first diesel engine manufacturers. We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and engine-related component products, including filtration, aftertreatment, turbochargers, fuel systems, controls systems, air handling systems and electric power generation systems. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide. We serve our customers through a network of approximately 600 company-owned and independent distributor locations and approximately 6,500 dealer locations in more than 190countries and territories.
Principles of Consolidation Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of all wholly-owned and majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries where our ownership is more than 50percent of outstanding equity interests except for majority-owned subsidiaries that are considered variable interest entities (VIEs) where we are not deemed to have a controlling financial interest. In addition, we also consolidate, regardless of our ownership percentage, VIEs for which we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Where our ownership interest is less than 100percent, the noncontrolling ownership interests are reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets . The noncontrolling ownership interest in our income, net of tax, is classified as "Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests" in our Consolidated Statements of Income .
Certain amounts for 2011 and 2010 have been reclassified to conform to the current classifications.
We have variable interests in several businesses accounted for under the equity method of accounting that are deemed to be VIEs and are subject to the provisions of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for variable interest entities. Most of these VIEs are unconsolidated and as such are included in the summary of disclosures in Note3, "INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INVESTEES." The VIEs, including the consolidated VIEs, are not material individually or in the aggregate to our Consolidated Balance Sheets or Consolidated Statements of Income .
Investments in Equity Investees We use the equity method to account for our investments in joint ventures, affiliated companies and alliances in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, generally represented by equity ownership or partnership equity of at least 20percent but not more than 50percent. Generally, under the equity method, original investments in these entities are recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted by our share of equity in income or losses after the date of acquisition. Investment amounts in excess of our share of an investee's net assets are amortized over the life of the related asset creating the excess. If the excess is goodwill, then it is not amortized. Equity in income or losses of each investee is recorded according to our level of ownership; if losses accumulate, we record our share of losses until our investment has been fully depleted. If our investment has been fully depleted, we recognize additional losses only when we are the primary funding source. We eliminate (to the extent of our ownership percentage) in our Consolidated Financial Statements the profit in inventory held by our equity method investees that has not yet been sold to a third-party. Our investments are classified 87 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) as "Investments and advances related to equity method investees" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Our share of the results from joint ventures, affiliated companies and alliances is reported in our Consolidated Statements of Income as "Equity, royalty and interest income from investees," and is reported net of all applicable income taxes.
Our foreign equity investees are presented net of applicable foreign income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Income . The vast majority of our United States (U.S.) equity investees are partnerships (non-taxable), thus there is no difference between gross or net of tax presentation as the investees are not taxed.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of the Financial Statements Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts presented and disclosed in our Consolidated Financial Statements . Significant estimates and assumptions in these Consolidated Financial Statements require the exercise of judgment and are used for, but not limited to, allowance for doubtful accounts, estimates of future cash flows and other assumptions associated with goodwill and long-lived asset impairment tests, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, warranty programs, determination of discount and other rate assumptions for pension and other postretirement benefit expenses, restructuring costs, income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances, lease classification and contingencies. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be different from these estimates.
Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue, net of estimated costs of returns, allowances and sales incentives, when it is realized or realizable, which generally occurs when:  Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,  The product has been shipped and legal title and all risks of ownership have been transferred,  The sales price is fixed and determinable and  Payment is reasonably assured.
Products are generally sold on open account under credit terms customary to the geographic region of distribution. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral to secure our accounts receivable. For engines, service parts, service tools and other items sold to independent distributors and to partially-owned distributors accounted for under the equity method, revenues are recorded when title and risk of ownership transfers. This transfer is based on the agreement in effect with the respective distributor, which in the U.S. and most international locations, generally occurs when the products are shipped. To the extent of our ownership percentage, margins on sales to distributors accounted for under the equity method are deferred until the distributor sells the product to unrelated parties.
88 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) We provide various sales incentives to both our distribution network and our OEM customers. These programs are designed to promote the sale of our product in the channel or encourage the usage of our products by OEM customers. Sales incentives primarily fall into three categories:  Volume rebates,  Market share rebates and  Aftermarket rebates.
For volume rebates, we provide certain customers with rebate opportunities for attaining specified volumes during a particular quarter or year. We accrue for the expected amount of these rebates at the time of the original sale and update our accruals quarterly based on our best estimate of the volume levels the customer will reach during the measurement period. For market share rebates, we provide certain customers with rebate opportunities based on the percentage of their production that utilizes our product. These rebates are typically measured either quarterly or annually and are accrued at the time of the original sale based on the current market shares, with adjustments made as the level changes. For aftermarket rebates we provide incentives to promote sales to certain dealers and end-markets. These rebates are typically paid on a quarterly, or more frequent, basis and estimates are made at the end of each quarter as to the amount yet to be paid. These estimates are based on historical experience with the particular program. The incentives are classified as a reduction in sales in our Consolidated Statements of Income .
Rights of return do not exist for the majority of our sales, other than for quality issues. We do offer certain return rights in our aftermarket business, where some aftermarket customers are permitted to return small amounts of parts and filters each year and in our power generation business, which sells portable generators to retail customers. An estimate of future returns is accrued at the time of sale based on historical return rates.
Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation We translate assets and liabilities of foreign entities to U.S. dollars, where the local currency is the functional currency, at year-end exchange rates. We translate income and expenses to U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates for the year. We record adjustments resulting from translation in a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and include the adjustments in net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying foreign investment.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in current net income. For foreign entities where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, including those operating in highly inflationary economies when applicable, we remeasure non-monetary balances and the related income statement using historical exchange rates. We include in income the resulting gains and losses, including the effect of derivatives in our Consolidated Statements of Income , which combined with transaction gains and losses amounted to a net loss of $14million in 2012, net loss of $14million in 2011 and net loss of $1million in 2010.
Derivative Instruments We make use of derivative instruments in foreign exchange, commodity price and interest rate hedging programs. Derivatives currently in use are foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swap 89 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) contracts, commodity zero-cost collars and an interest rate swap. These contracts are used strictly for hedging and not for speculative purposes.
Due to our international business presence, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. We transact in foreign currencies and have significant assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Consequently, our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to benefit from global diversification and after considering naturally offsetting currency positions, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize our existing exposures (recognized assets and liabilities) and hedge forecasted transactions.
We are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers. In order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and, consequently, fluctuations in gross margins, we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations.
We record all derivatives at fair value in our financial statements. Note21, "DERIVATIVES," provides further information on our hedging strategy and accounting for derivative financial instruments.
Income Tax Accounting We determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December31, 2012, we recorded net deferred tax assets of $396million. These assets included $165million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $95million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. A more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in Note4, "INCOME TAXES." Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90days or less at the time of purchase. The carrying amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these investments.
90 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Statements of Cash Flows-Supplemental Disclosures Years ended December31, In millions 2012 2011 2010 Changes in current assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and dispositions, were as follows: Accounts and notes receivable $ 87 $ (350 ) $ (195 ) Inventories (32 ) (225 ) (574 ) Other current assets (60 ) (21 ) (54 ) Accounts payable (256 ) 208 345 Accrued expenses (514 ) 234 233 Total $ (775 ) $ (154 ) $ (245 ) Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds $ 691 $ 532 $ 312 Cash payments for interest, net of capitalized interest $ 32 $ 47 $ 42 Marketable Securities We account for marketable securities in accordance with GAAP for investments in debt and equity securities. We determine the appropriate classification of all marketable securities as "held-to-maturity, "available-for-sale" or "trading" at the time of purchase, and re-evaluate such classifications at each balance sheet date. At December31, 2012 and 2011, all of our investments were classified as available-for-sale.
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income. Unrealized losses considered to be "other-than-temporary" are recognized currently in income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The fair value of most investment securities is determined by currently available market prices. Where quoted market prices are not available, we use the market price of similar types of securities that are traded in the market to estimate fair value. See Note5, "MARKETABLE SECURITIES," for a detailed description of our investments in marketable securities.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, which approximates net realizable value, and generally do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on our historical collection experience and by performing an analysis of our accounts receivable in light of the current economic environment. We review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis. In addition, when necessary, we provide an allowance for the full amount of specific accounts deemed to be uncollectible. Account balances are charged off against the allowance in the 91 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) period in which we determine that it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows: December31, In millions 2012 2011 2010 Balance, beginning of year $ 12 $ 15 $ 13 Provision for bad debts 6 6 5 Write-offs (5 ) (8 ) (3 ) Other  (1 )  Balance, end of year $ 13 $ 12 $ 15 Inventories Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. For the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, approximately 14percent and 17percent, respectively, of our consolidated inventories (primarily heavy-duty and high-horsepower engines and parts) were valued using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost method. The cost of other inventories is generally valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method. Our inventories at interim and year-end reporting dates include estimates for adjustments related to annual physical inventory results and for inventory cost changes under the LIFO cost method. Due to significant movements of partially-manufactured components and parts between manufacturing plants, we do not internally measure, nor do our accounting systems provide, a meaningful segregation between raw materials and work-in-process.
Property, Plant and Equipment We record property, plant and equipment, inclusive of assets under capital leases, at cost. We depreciate the cost of certain engine production equipment using a modified units-of-production method, which is based upon units produced subject to a minimum level. We depreciate the cost of all other equipment using the straight-line method with depreciable lives ranging from 20 to 40years for buildings and three to 20years for machinery, equipment and fixtures. Capital lease amortization is recorded in depreciation expense. We expense normal maintenance and repair costs as incurred. Depreciation expense totaled $287million, $264million and $248million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Long-Lived Assets We review our long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of the long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. An impairment of a long-lived asset or asset group exists when the expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) estimated to be generated by the asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset or asset group, an impairment loss is measured based on the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the asset or asset group. Assumptions and estimates used to estimate cash flows in the evaluation of impairment and the fair values used to determine the impairment are subject to a degree of judgment and complexity. Any 92 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) changes to the assumptions and estimates resulting from changes in actual results or market conditions from those anticipated may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and could result in a future impairment charge.
Goodwill Under GAAP for goodwill, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform an annual two-step goodwill impairment test. The two-step impairment test is now only required if an entity determines through this qualitative analysis that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In addition, carrying value of goodwill must be tested for impairment on an interim basis in certain circumstances where impairment may be indicated. When we are required or opt to perform the two-step impairment test, the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated by discounting the after tax future cash flows less requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions. Our reporting units are generally defined as one level below an operating segment. However, there were two situations where we have aggregated two or more components which share similar economic characteristics and thus are aggregated into a single reporting unit for testing purposes. These two situations are described further below. This analysis has resulted in the following reporting units for our goodwill testing:  Within our Components segment, emission solutions and filtration have been aggregated into a single reporting unit.
Also within our Components segment, our turbo technologies business is considered a separate reporting unit.
Within our Power Generation segment, our generator technologies business is considered a separate reporting unit.
Within our Engine segment, our new and recon parts business is considered a separate reporting unit. This reporting unit is in the business of selling new parts and remanufacturing and reconditioning engines and certain engine components.
Our Distribution segment is considered a single reporting unit as it is managed geographically and all regions share similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services.
No other reporting units have goodwill. Our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue, operating expenses, working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multi-year period. Additionally, management must estimate a weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects a market rate, for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate. The discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and, if less than the carrying value, a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if an impairment loss has occurred. In addition, we also perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how much our forecasts can fluctuate before the fair value of a reporting unit would be lower than its carrying amount. We performed the required procedures as of the end of our fiscal third quarter and determined that our goodwill was not impaired. At December31, 2012, our recorded goodwill was $445million, approximately 90percent of which resided in the emission solutions plus filtration reporting unit. For this reporting unit, the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin. Changes in our projections or estimates, a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a 93 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill.
Software We capitalize certain costs for software that are developed or obtained for internal use. Software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives generally ranging from three to 12years. Software assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets. Upgrades and enhancements are capitalized if they result in significant modifications that enable the software to perform tasks it was previously incapable of performing. Software maintenance, training, data conversion and business process reengineering costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
Warranty We charge the estimated costs of warranty programs, other than product recalls, to income at the time products are shipped to customers. We use historical experience of warranty programs to develop the estimated liability for our various warranty programs. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable, which generally occurs when it is announced. The liability for these programs is reflected in the provision for warranties issued. We review and assess the liability for these programs on a quarterly basis. We also assess our ability to recover certain costs from our suppliers and record a receivable from the supplier when we believe a recovery is probable. At December31, 2012, we had $13million of receivables related to estimated supplier recoveries of which $7million was included in "Trade and other receivables, net" and $6million was included in "Other assets" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets . At December31, 2011, we had $14million of receivables related to estimated supplier recoveries of which $7million was included in "Trade and other receivables, net" and $7million was included in "Other assets" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets .
In addition, we sell extended warranty coverage on most of our engines. The revenue collected is initially deferred and is recognized as revenue in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services over the contract period. We compare the remaining deferred revenue balance quarterly to the estimated amount of future claims under extended warranty programs and provide an additional accrual when the deferred revenue balance is less than expected future costs.
Research and Development Our research and development program is focused on product improvements, innovations and cost reductions for our customers. Research and development expenditures include salaries, contractor fees, building costs, utilities, administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed, net of contract reimbursements, when incurred. Research and development expenses, net of contract reimbursements, were $721million in 2012, $621million in 2011 and $402million in 2010. Contract reimbursements were $86million in 2012, $75million in 2011 and $68million in 2010.

RECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended its rules regarding the presentation of comprehensive income. The objective of this amendment was to improve the comparability, consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. Specifically, this amendment requires that all non-owner changes in shareholders' equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In addition, the standard also requires disclosure of the location of reclassification adjustments between other comprehensive income and net income on the face of the financial statements. The new rules became effective for us beginning January1, 2012. In December 2011, the FASB deferred certain aspects of this standard beyond the current effective date, specifically the provisions dealing with reclassification adjustments. Because the standard only impacts the display of comprehensive income and does not impact what is included in comprehensive income, the standard did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements .
In May 2011, the FASB amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures. The objective of the amendment was to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S.GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. Primarily this amendment changed the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S.GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in addition to clarifying the Board's intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements. The new standard also requires additional disclosures related to fair value measurements categorized within Level3 of the fair value hierarchy and requires disclosure of the categorization in the hierarchy for items which are not recorded at fair value but fair value is required to be disclosed. The new rules were effective for us beginning January1, 2012. As of December31, 2012, we had no fair value measurements categorized within Level3 outside of our pension plans. The only impact for us is the disclosure of the categorization in the fair value hierarchy for those items where fair value is only disclosed (primarily our debt obligations). Our disclosure related to the new standard is included in Note6, "FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS," to the Consolidated Financial Statements .
Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective In December 2011, the FASB amended its standards related to offsetting assets and liabilities. This amendment requires entities to disclose both gross and net information about certain instruments and 95 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and certain instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting agreement. This information will enable users of the financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position. The new rules will become effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. It is also required that the new disclosures are applied for all comparative periods presented. In January 2013, the FASB further amended this standard to limit its scope to derivatives, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowings and lending transactions. We do not believe this amendment will have a significant effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements . While we are still finalizing our analysis, due to the scope limitation we also do not expect any significant changes to our footnote disclosures.
In February 2013, the FASB amended its standards on comprehensive income by requiring disclosure in the footnotes of information about amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. Specifically, the amendment will require disclosure of the line items of net income in which the item was reclassified only if it is reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. It will also require cross reference to other disclosures for amounts that are not reclassified in their entirety in the same reporting period. The new disclosures will be required for us prospectively only for annual periods beginning January1, 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods.
NOTE2. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES Acquisitions In April 2012, we reached an agreement to acquire the doser technology and business assets from Hilite GermanyGmbH (Hilite) in a cash transaction. Dosers are products that enable compliance with emission standards in certain aftertreatment systems and complement our current product offerings. The transaction was approved by German regulators in June and closed on July18, 2012. The purchase price was $176million and is summarized below. There was no contingent consideration associated with this transaction. During 2012, we expensed approximately $4million of acquisition related costs.
The acquisition of Hilite was accounted for as a business combination, with the results of the acquired entity and the goodwill included in the Components operating segment in the third quarter of 2012. The majority of the purchase price was allocated to technology and customer related intangible assets and goodwill, most of which is expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes. We expect the Hilite acquisition to strengthen our aftertreatment product offerings. This acquisition enhances our technical capabilities and keeps us in a strong position to meet the needs of current customers and grow into new markets, especially as an increasing number of regions around the world adopt tougher emission standards.

In July 2012, we acquired an additional 45percent interest in Cummins Central Power from the former principal for consideration of approximately $20million. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, with the results of the acquired entity included in the Distribution operating segment in the third quarter of 2012. Distribution segment results also included a $7million gain, as we were required to re-measure our pre-existing 35percent ownership interest in Cummins Central Power to fair value in accordance with GAAP. Net sales for Cummins Central Power were $242million in 2012, of which $115million was included in our Consolidated Statements of Income and represented less than 1percent of consolidated sales, and $209million in 2011.
Divestitures In the second quarter of 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business which manufactures exhaust products and select components for emission systems for a variety of applications not core to our other product offerings. This business was historically included in our Components segment. The sales price was $123million. We recognized a gain on the sale of $68million ($37million after-tax), which included a goodwill allocation of $19million. The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December31, 2011.
Sales for this business were $62million and $171million in 2011 (through closing) and 2010, respectively. Income before income taxes for this business were approximately $9million and $22 million in 2011 (through closing) and 2010, respectively.
97 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES (Continued) During the fourth quarter of 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our light-duty filtration business which manufactures light-duty automotive and industrial filtration solutions. The sales price was $90million and included a note receivable from the buyer of approximately $1million. There are no earnouts or other contingencies associated with the sales price. We recognized a gain on the sale of $53million ($33million after-tax), which included a goodwill allocation of $6million. The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December31, 2011.
Sales for this business were $64million and $74million in 2011 (through closing) and 2010, respectively. Income before income taxes for this business were approximately $13million and $9 million in 2011 (through closing) and 2010, respectively.
In the second quarter of 2012, we recorded an additional $6million gain ($4million after-tax) related to final purchase price adjustments for our 2011 divestitures. The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December31, 2012.

Our 2012 income tax provision includes a one-time $134million tax benefit resulting from transactions entered into and tax return elections made with respect to our UnitedKingdom (U.K.) operations.
Retained earnings of our U.K. domiciled subsidiaries and certain Singapore, German and Indian subsidiaries are considered to be permanently reinvested. In addition, earnings of our China operations generated after December31, 2011, are considered to be permanently reinvested and additional U.S. deferred tax is no longer being provided on these earnings generated after 2011. China's permanently reinvested earnings are expected to be used for items such as capital expenditures and to fund joint ventures in China. The total permanently reinvested retained earnings and related cumulative translation adjustment balances for these entities were $2.3billion, $1.5billion and $1.2 billion for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These amounts were determined primarily based on book retained earnings balances for these subsidiaries translated at historical rates. The determination of the deferred tax liability related to these retained earnings and cumulative translation adjustment balances which are considered to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. is not practicable. We may periodically repatriate a portion of these earnings to the extent we can do so essentially tax-free or at minimal tax cost.

This equity income is recorded net of foreign taxes. Additional U.S. income taxes of $9million, $49million and $50million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were provided for the additional U.S. taxes that will ultimately be due upon the distribution of the foreign joint venture equity income.
Carryforward tax benefits and the tax effect of temporary differences between financial and tax reporting that give rise to net deferred tax assets were as follows: December31, In millions 2012 2011 Deferred tax asset U.S. federal and state carryforward benefits $ 115 $ 86 Foreign carryforward benefits 50 42 Employee benefit plans 369 334 Warranty and marketing expenses 308 302 Deferred research and development expenses  6 Accrued expenses 75 73 Other 78 47 Gross deferred tax assets 995 890 Valuation allowance (95 ) (71 ) Total deferred tax assets 900 819 Deferred tax liabilities Property, plant and equipment (218 ) (158 ) Unremitted income of foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures (213 ) (222 ) Other (73 ) (22 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (504 ) (402 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 396 $ 417 Our 2012 U.S. federal and state carryforward benefits include $115million of state credit and net operating loss carryforward benefits that begin to expire in 2013. Our foreign carryforward benefits include $50million of net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2013. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the gross deferred tax assets to an amount we believe is more likely 104 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE4. INCOME TAXES (Continued) than not to be realized. The valuation allowance increased in 2012 by a net $24million and increased in 2011 by a net $21million. The valuation allowance is primarily attributable to the uncertainty regarding the realization of a portion of the U.S. state and foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits. Prepaid and other current assets includes deferred tax assets of $232million and $268million for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In addition, prepaid and other current assets includes refundable income taxes of $240million and $45million for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Other assets includes deferred tax assets of $177million and $167million for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Other liabilities and deferred revenue includes deferred tax liabilities of $13million and $18million for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows: In millions Balance at December31, 2009 $ 56 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 2 Additions based on tax positions related to the prior years 35 Reductions for tax positions related to prior years (5 ) Reductions for tax positions relating to lapse of statute of limitations (3 ) Balance at December31, 2010 85 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 5 Additions based on tax positions related to the prior years 44 Reductions for tax positions related to prior years (3 ) Reductions for tax positions relating to settlements with taxing authorities (39 ) Reductions for tax positions relating to lapse of statute of limitations (6 ) Balance at December31, 2011 86 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 4 Additions based on tax positions related to the prior years 57 Reductions for tax positions related to prior years (2 ) Balance at December31, 2012 $ 145 Included in the December31, 2012 and 2011, balances are $87million and $75million related to tax positions that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate in future periods. Also, we had accrued interest expense related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $2million, $7million and $30million as of December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During the years ending December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recognized $(3)million, $(15)million and $5million in net interest expense, respectively. In 2011, as a result of the settlement of certain tax positions with tax authorities in China, we reduced our liability for unrecognized tax benefits by $39million and the related net accrued interest of $16million. The $39million reduction was fully offset by adjustments to other income tax balance sheet accounts resulting in zero net income statement impact. As the settlement with the tax authorities included no interest or penalties being incurred, we recognized a $16million income tax benefit in 2011 from the release of the accrued interest previously recorded related to the unrecognized tax benefits that were settled.
105 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE4. INCOME TAXES (Continued) Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. Although we believe that adequate provision has been made for such issues, there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on our earnings. Conversely, if these issues are resolved favorably in the future, the related provision would be reduced, thus having a positive impact on earnings. We do not expect any significant change to our unrecognized tax benefits within the next year.
As a result of our global operations, we file income tax returns in various jurisdictions including U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. We are routinely subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, India, Mexico, the U.K. and the U.S. With few exceptions, our U.S. federal, major state and foreign jurisdictions are no longer subject to income tax assessments for years before 2009.

Gross realized gains from the sale of available-for-sale (AFS) securities were $3million for the year ended 2012, $3million for the year ended 2011 and less than $1million for the year ended 2010. Gross realized losses from the sale of AFS securities were less than $1million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
At December31, 2012, the fair value of AFS investments in debt securities by contractual maturity was as follows: Maturity date Fair value In millions 1year or less $ 46 1 - 5years 2 5 - 10years 1 Total $ 49 106 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE6. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable. We primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and utilize the best available information. Accordingly, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. We are able to classify fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value giving the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level3 measurement). At December31, 2012, we did not have any Level3 financial assets or liabilities, other than those in our pension plan (see Note12, "PENSION BENEFITS AND OTHER POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS").
The majority of the assets and liabilities we carry at fair value are AFS securities and derivatives. AFS securities are derived from Level1 or Level2 inputs. The predominance of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. The fair value measurement of derivatives are valued primarily using Level2 inputs. Many of our derivative contracts are valued utilizing publicly available pricing data of contracts with similar terms. In other cases, the contracts are valued using current spot market data adjusted for the appropriate current forward curves provided by external financial institutions. We participate in commodity swap contracts, commodity zero-cost collar contracts, currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps. When material, we adjust the values of our derivative contracts for counter-party or our credit risk. There were no transfers into or out of Levels2 or 3 during 2012.

A description of the valuation techniques and inputs used for our Level2 fair value measures are as follows: Debt mutual funds Assets in Level2 consist of exchange traded mutual funds that lack sufficient trading volume to be classified at Level1. The fair value measure for these investments is the daily net asset value published on a regulated governmental website. Daily quoted prices are available from the issuing brokerage and are used on a test basis to corroborate this Level2 input.
Bank debentures and Certificates of deposit These investments provide us with a fixed rate of return and generally range in maturity from six months to three years. The counter-parties to these investments are reputable financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. Since these instruments are not tradable and must be settled directly by us with the respective financial institution, our fair value measure is the financial institutions' month-end statement.
Government debt securities-non-U.S. and Corporate debt securities The fair value measure for these securities are broker quotes received from reputable firms. These securities are infrequently traded on a national stock exchange and these values are used on a test basis to corroborate our Level2 input measure.
108 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE6. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued) Foreign currency forward contracts The fair value measure for these contracts are determined based on forward foreign exchange rates received from third-party pricing services. These rates are based upon market transactions and are periodically corroborated by comparing to third-party broker quotes.
Commodity swap contracts The fair value measure for these contracts are current spot market data adjusted for the appropriate current forward curves provided by external financial institutions. The current spot price is the most significant component of this valuation and is based upon market transactions. We use third-party pricing services for the spot price component of this valuation which is periodically corroborated by market data from broker quotes.
Commodity call and put option contracts We utilize the month-end statement from the issuing financial institution as our fair value measure for this investment. We corroborate this valuation through the use of a third-party pricing service for similar assets and liabilities.
Interest rate contracts We currently have only one interest rate contract. We utilize the month-end statement from the issuing financial institution as our fair value measure for this investment. We corroborate this valuation through the use of a third-party pricing service for similar assets and liabilities.

Revolving Credit Facility On November9, 2012, we entered into a five-year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders. The credit agreement provides us with a $1.75billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are to be used by us for working capital or other general corporate purposes.
The credit facility matures on November9, 2017. Amounts payable under our revolving credit facility will rank pro rata with all of our unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness. Up to $200million under our credit facility is available for swingline loans denominated in U.S. dollars. Advances under the facility bear interest at (i)a base rate or (ii)a rate equal to the LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of our outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. Based on our current long-term debt ratings, the applicable margin on LIBOR Rate loans was 0.875percent per annum as of December31, 2012. Advances under the facility may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs.
The credit agreement includes various covenants, including, among others, maintaining a leverage ratio of no more than 3.25 to 1.0. As of December31, 2012, we were in compliance with the covenants.
The table below is a reconciliation of the maximum capacity of our revolver to the amount available under the facility as of December31, 2012. There were no outstanding borrowings under this facility at December31, 2012.

During 2010, two of our wholly-owned Brazilian subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement for a loan in local currency in an amount equivalent to US $50million, at drawdown, at a fixed rate of 4.5percent to finance its exports over the next three years. The principal of the loan had a two-year grace period and began amortizing in 2012.
During 2009, one wholly-owned subsidiary, Cummins BrasilLtda, entered into a loan agreement with the Brazil development bank, BNDES, for a loan in local currency in an amount equivalent to US $45million, at drawdown, at a fixed rate of 4.5percent to finance its exports over the next three years. The principal of the loan had a two-year grace period which began amortizing in 2011 and was completed in August of 2012.
Our debt agreements contain several restrictive covenants. The most restrictive of these covenants applies to our revolving credit facility which will upon default, among other things, limit our ability to 113 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 10. DEBT (Continued) incur additional debt or issue preferred stock, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, sell or create liens on our assets, make investments and merge or consolidate with any other person. In addition, we are subject to a maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratio financial covenant. As of December31, 2012, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our borrowing agreements.
NOTE 11. PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY We charge the estimated costs of warranty programs, other than product recalls, to income at the time products are shipped to customers. We use historical claims experience to develop the estimated liability. We review product recall programs on a quarterly basis and, if necessary, record a liability when we commit to an action or when they become probable and estimable, which is reflected in the provision for warranties issued line. We also sell extended warranty coverage on several engines.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS Pension Plans We sponsor several contributory and noncontributory pension plans covering substantially all employees. Generally, hourly employee pension benefits are earned based on years of service and compensation during active employment while future benefits for salaried employees are determined using a cash balance formula. However, the level of benefits and terms of vesting may vary among plans. Pension plan assets are administered by trustees and are principally invested in equity securities and fixed income securities. It is our policy to make contributions to our various qualified plans in accordance with statutory and contractual funding requirements and any additional contributions we determine are appropriate.

We are committed to its long-term strategy and do not attempt to time the market given empirical evidence that asset allocation is more critical than individual asset or investment manager selection. Rebalancing of the assets has and continues to occur. The rebalancing is critical to having the proper weighting of assets to achieve the expected total portfolio returns. We believe that our portfolio is highly diversified and does not have any significant exposure to concentration risk. The plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans do not include any of our common stock.
U.S. Plan Assets For the U.S. qualified pension plans, our assumption for the expected return on assets was 8.0percent in 2012. Projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. We expect additional positive returns from this active investment management. Based on the historical 118 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 12. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued) returns and forward-looking return expectations, we have elected to use an assumption of 8.0percent per year beginning in 2013.
The primary investment objective is to exceed, on a net-of-fee basis, the rate of return of a policy portfolio comprised of the following: Asset Class Target Range U.S. equities 20.0 % +/-5.0 % Non-U.S. equities 8.0 % +/-4.0 % Global equities 12.0 % +/-4.0 % Total equities 40.0 % Real estate 7.5 % +2.5/-7.5 % Private equity 7.5 % +2.5/-7.5 % Fixed income 45.0 % +/-5.0 % Total 100.0 % The fixed income component is structured to represent a custom bond benchmark that will closely hedge the change in the value of our liabilities. This component is structured in such a way that its benchmark covers approximately 90percent of the plan's exposure to changes in its discount rate (AAcorporate bond yields). In order to achieve a hedge on more than the targeted 46percent of plan assets invested in fixed income securities, the Benefits Policy Committee does permit the fixed income managers, other managers or the custodian/trustee to utilize derivative securities, as part of a liability driven investment strategy to further reduce the plan's risk of declining interest rates. However, all managers hired to manage assets for the trust are prohibited from using leverage unless specifically discussed with the committee and allowed for in their guidelines.
U.K. Plan Assets For the U.K. qualified pension plans, our assumption for the expected return on assets was 6.5percent in 2012. The methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations. Our strategy with respect to our investments in these assets is to be invested in a suitable mixture of return-seeking assets (equities and real estate) and liability matching assets (bonds) with a long-term outlook. Therefore, the risk and return balance of our U.K. asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. To achieve these objectives we have established the following targets: Asset Class Target Range Global equities 40.0 % +7.5/- 5.0 % Real estate 5.0 % +7.5/- 5.0 % Re-insurance 5.0 % +7.5/- 5.0 % Private equity 5.0 % +7.5/- 5.0 % Fixed income 45.0 % +5.5/- 2.0 % Total 100.0 % 119 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 12. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued) As part of our strategy in the U.K. we have not prohibited the use of any financial instrument, including derivatives. Based on the above discussion, we have elected to use our assumption of 5.8percent per year beginning in 2013.

These financial statements are audited at least annually. In conjunction with our investment consultant, we monitor the fair value of the insurance contract as periodically reported by our insurer and their counterparty risk. The fair value of all real estate properties, held in the partnerships, are valued at least once per year by an independent professional real estate valuation firm. Fair value generally represents the fund's proportionate share of the net assets of the investment partnerships as reported by the general partners of the underlying partnerships. Some securities with no readily available market are initially valued at cost, utilizing independent professional valuation firms as well as market comparisons with subsequent adjustments to values which reflect either the basis of meaningful third-party transactions in the private market or the fair value deemed appropriate by the general partners of the underlying investment partnerships. In such instances, consideration is also given to the financial condition and operating results of the issuer, the amount that the investment partnerships can reasonably expect to realize upon the sale of the securities and any other factors deemed relevant. The estimated fair values are subject to uncertainty and therefore may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments existed and such differences could be material.
Estimated Future Contributions and Benefit Payments We plan to contribute approximately $170million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2013.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 12. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued) Other Pension Plans We also sponsor defined contribution plans for certain hourly and salaried employees. Our contributions to these plans were $74million, $72million and $44million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
Other Postretirement Benefits Our other postretirement benefit plans provide various health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees, who retire and satisfy certain age and service requirements, and their dependents. The plans are contributory and contain cost-sharing features such as caps, deductibles, coinsurance and spousal contributions. Employer contributions are limited by formulas in each plan. Retiree contributions for health care benefits are adjusted annually and we reserve the right to change benefits covered under these plans. There were no plan assets for the postretirement benefit plans as our policy is to fund benefits and expenses for these plans as claims and premiums are incurred.
Obligations and Funded Status The following tables present the changes in the benefit obligations, the funded status of the plans and the amounts recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for our significant other postretirement benefit plans.

Assumptions The table below presents assumptions used in determining the other postretirement benefit obligation for each year and reflects weighted-average percentages for our other postretirement plans: 2012 2011 Discount rate 3.70 % 4.70 % The table below presents assumptions used in determining the net periodic other postretirement benefits cost and reflects weighted-average percentages for the various plans: 2012 2011 2010 Discount rate 4.70 % 5.20 % 5.60 % 127 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 12. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued) Our consolidated other postretirement benefit obligation is determined by application of the terms of health care and life insurance plans, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and health care cost trend rates. For measurement purposes, an 8.00percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed in 2012. The rate was assumed to remain at 8.00percent in 2013 and then decrease on a linear basis to 5.00percent through 2019 and remain at that level thereafter. An increase in the health care cost trends of 1percent would increase our APBO by $27million as of December31, 2012 and the net periodic other postretirement benefit expense for 2013 by $1million. A decrease in the health care cost trends of 1percent would decrease our APBO by $23million as of December31, 2012 and the net periodic other postretirement benefit expense for 2013 by $1million.
Estimated Benefit Payments The table below presents expected benefit payments under our other postretirement benefit plans: In millions 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018-2022 Expected benefit payments $ 47 $ 45 $ 43 $ 40 $ 38 $ 157 NOTE 13.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES We are subject to numerous lawsuits and claims arising out of the ordinary course of our business, including actions related to product liability; personal injury; the use and performance of our products; warranty matters; patent, trademark or other intellectual property infringement; contractual liability; the conduct of our business; tax reporting in foreign jurisdictions; distributor termination; workplace safety; and environmental matters. We also have been identified as a potentially responsible party at multiple waste disposal sites under U.S. federal and related state environmental statutes and regulations and may have joint and several liability for any investigation and remediation costs incurred with respect to such sites. We have denied liability with respect to many of these lawsuits, claims and proceedings and are vigorously defending such lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We carry various forms of commercial, property and casualty, product liability and other forms of insurance; however, such insurance may not be applicable or adequate to cover the costs associated with a judgment against us with respect to these lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We do not believe that these lawsuits are 128 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) material individually or in the aggregate. While we believe we have also established adequate accruals for our expected future liability with respect to pending lawsuits, claims and proceedings, where the nature and extent of any such liability can be reasonably estimated based upon then presently available information, there can be no assurance that the final resolution of any existing or future lawsuits, claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
We conduct significant business operations in Brazil that are subject to the Brazilian federal, state and local labor, social security, tax and customs laws. While we believe we comply with such laws, they are complex, subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances. In 2010, it was determined that we overpaid a Brazilian revenue based tax during the period 2004-2008. Our results include a recovery of $32million recorded in cost of sales ($21million after-tax) related to tax credits on imported products arising from an overpayment. This recovery has been excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year.
In June 2008, four of our sites in Southern Indiana, including our Technical Center, experienced extensive flood damage. In October 2011, we received $40million from our insurance carriers to settle all outstanding 2008 flood claims. As a result, we recognized a gain of approximately $38million ($24million after-tax), net of any remaining flood related expenses, in "Other operating income (expense), net" in our Consolidated Statements of Income .
U.S. Distributor Commitments Our distribution agreements with independent and partially-owned distributors generally have a renewable three-year term and are restricted to specified territories. Our distributors develop and maintain a network of dealers with which we have no direct relationship. Our distributors are permitted to sell other, noncompetitive products only with our consent. We license all of our distributors to use our name and logo in connection with the sale and service of our products, with no right to assign or sublicense the trademarks, except to authorized dealers, without our consent. Products are sold to the distributors at standard domestic or international distributor net prices, as applicable. Net prices are wholesale prices we establish to permit our distributors an adequate margin on their sales. Subject to local laws, we can generally refuse to renew these agreements upon expiration or terminate them upon written notice for inadequate sales, change in principal ownership and certain other reasons. Distributors also have the right to terminate the agreements upon 60-day notice without cause, or 30-day notice for cause. Upon termination or failure to renew, we are required to purchase the distributor's current inventory, signage and special tools, and may, at our option purchase other assets of the distributor, but are under no obligation to do so.
Other Guarantees and Commitments In addition to the matters discussed above, from time to time we enter into other guarantee arrangements, including guarantees of non-U.S. distributor financing, residual value guarantees on equipment under operating leases and other miscellaneous guarantees of third-party obligations. As of December31, 2012, the maximum potential loss related to these other guarantees is summarized as 129 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) follows (where the guarantee is in a foreign currency the amount below represents the amount in U.S. dollars at current exchange rates): In millions Cummins Olayan Energy Limited debt guarantee $ 11 Xi'an Cummins Engine Company Limited debt guarantee 2 Residual value guarantees 1 Other debt guarantees 2 Maximum potential loss $ 16 The amount of liabilities related to the above guarantees was $2million.
We have arrangements with certain suppliers that require us to purchase minimum volumes or be subject to monetary penalties. The penalty amounts are less than our purchase commitments and essentially allow the supplier to recover their tooling costs in most instances. As of December31, 2012, if we were to stop purchasing from each of these suppliers, the aggregate amount of the penalty would be approximately $94million, of which $90million relates to a contract with an engine parts supplier that extends to 2016. In addition, we also have a "take or pay" contract with an emission solutions business supplier requiring us to purchase approximately $73million annually through 2018. These arrangements enable us to secure critical components. We do not currently anticipate paying any penalties under these contracts.
We have guarantees with certain customers that require us to satisfactorily honor contractual or regulatory obligations, or compensate for monetary losses related to nonperformance. These performance bonds and other performance-related guarantees were $70million and $81million as of December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Indemnifications Periodically, we enter into various contractual arrangements where we agree to indemnify a third-party against certain types of losses. Common types of indemnities include:  product liability and license, patent or trademark indemnifications,  asset sale agreements where we agree to indemnify the purchaser against future environmental exposures related to the asset sold and  any contractual agreement where we agree to indemnify the counter-party for losses suffered as a result of a misrepresentation in the contract.
We regularly evaluate the probability of having to incur costs associated with these indemnities and accrue for expected losses that are probable. Because the indemnities are not related to specified known liabilities and due to their uncertain nature, we are unable to estimate the maximum amount of the potential loss associated with these indemnifications.
Joint Venture Commitments As of December31, 2012, we have committed to invest an additional $86million into existing joint ventures with $75million to be funded in 2013.

We can determine the number of shares of each series, and the rights, preferences and limitations of each series. At December31, 2012, there was no preferred or preference stock outstanding.
Common Stock Changes in shares of common stock, treasury stock and common stock held in trust for employee benefit plans are as follows: In millions Common Stock Treasury Stock Common Stock Held in Trust Balance at December31, 2009 222.0 20.7 3.0 Shares acquired  3.5  Shares issued 0.2 (0.2 )  Employee benefits trust activity   (0.9 ) Other shareholder transactions (0.4 )   Balance at December31, 2010 221.8 24.0 2.1 Shares acquired  6.4  Shares issued 0.4 (0.2 )  Employee benefits trust activity   (0.3 ) Balance at December31, 2011 222.2 30.2 1.8 Shares acquired  2.6  Shares issued 0.4 (0.2 )  Employee benefits trust activity   (0.3 ) Other shareholder transactions (0.2 )   Balance at December31, 2012 222.4 32.6 1.5 Treasury Stock Shares of common stock repurchased by us are recorded at cost as treasury stock and result in a reduction of shareholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets . Treasury shares may be reissued as part of our stock-based compensation programs. When shares are reissued, we use the weighted-average cost method for determining cost. The gains between the cost of the shares and the issuance price are added to additional paid-in-capital. The losses are deducted from additional paid-in capital to the extent of the gains. Thereafter, the losses are deducted from retained earnings. Treasury stock activity for the three-year period ended December31, 2012, consisting of shares issued and repurchased is presented in our Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity .

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (Continued) In February 2011, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program and authorized the acquisition of up to $1billion of our common stock. In 2012, we made the following quarterly purchases under this plan: In millions (except per share amounts) For each quarter ended 2012 Shares Purchased Average Cost Per Share Total Cost of Repurchases Remaining Authorized Capacity April1 0.1 $ 114.97 $ 8 $ 474 July1 1.8 104.00 188 286 September30 0.4 84.95 35 251 December31 0.3 87.83 25 226 Total 2.6 99.47 $ 256 In December 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $1billion of our common stock upon completion of the 2011 repurchase program.
Quarterly Dividends In July 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a 25percent increase to our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.40 per share to $0.50 per share. In July 2011, the Board of Directors approved a 52percent increase to our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.2625 per share to $0.40 per share. In July 2010, our Board of Directors approved a 50percent increase in our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.175 per share to $0.2625 per share. Cash dividends per share paid to common shareholders for the last three years were as follows: Quarterly Dividends 2012 2011 2010 First quarter $ 0.40 $ 0.2625 $ 0.175 Second quarter 0.40 0.2625 0.175 Third quarter 0.50 0.40 0.2625 Fourth quarter 0.50 0.40 0.2625 Total $ 1.80 $ 1.325 $ 0.875 Total dividends paid to common shareholders in 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $340million, $255million and $172million, respectively. Declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon our income and liquidity position, among other factors, and is subject to declaration by our Board of Directors, who meet quarterly to consider our dividend payment. We expect to fund dividend payments with cash from operations.
Employee Benefits Trust In 1997, we established the Employee Benefits Trust (EBT) funded with common stock for use in meeting our future obligations under employee benefit and compensation plans. The primary sources of cash for the EBT are dividends received on unallocated shares of our common stock held by the EBT. The EBT may be used to fund matching contributions to employee accounts in the 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) made in proportion to employee contributions under the terms of the RSP. In 133 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 15. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (Continued) addition, we may direct the trustee to sell shares of the EBT on the open market to fund other non-qualified employee benefit plans. Matching contributions charged to income for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $27million, $28million and $21million, respectively. EBT shares sold on the open market and proceeds from those sales for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: In millions 2012 2011 2010 EBT shares sold on open market   0.7 Proceeds from sale $  $  $ 58 134 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC.

STOCK INCENTIVE AND STOCK OPTION PLANS In May 2012, our shareholders approved the 2012 Omnibus Plan (the Plan), which replaced and succeeded the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan. The Plan allows for the granting of up to 13.5million stock-based awards to executives and employees, of which one-half must be in the form of stock options or stock appreciation rights. Awards available for grant under the Plan include, but are not limited to, stock options, stock appreciation rights and stock awards. Shares issued under the Plan may be newly issued shares or reissued treasury shares.
Stock options are generally granted with a strike price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant, a life of 10years and a two-year vesting period. The strike price may be higher than the fair value of the stock on the date of the grant, but cannot be lower. Compensation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the vesting period beginning on the grant date. The compensation expense is based on the fair value of each option grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Options granted to employees eligible for retirement under our retirement plan are fully expensed as of the grant date.
Stock options are also awarded through the Key Employee Stock Investment Plan (KESIP) which allows certain employees, other than officers, to purchase shares of common stock on an installment basis up to an established credit limit. Fifty stock options are granted for every even block of 100 KESIP shares purchased by the employee. The options granted through the KESIP program are considered awards under the Plan and are vested immediately. Compensation expense for stock options granted through the KESIP program is recorded based on the fair value of each option grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Performance shares are granted as target awards and are earned based on our return on equity (ROE) performance. A payout factor has been established ranging from 0 to 200percent of the target award based on our actual ROE performance. Shares granted during or prior to 2010, have a two-year performance period and a one year restriction period. Employees leaving the company prior to the end of the restriction period forfeit any shares subject to the restriction period. Shares granted during 2011 or after, have a three-year performance period and no restriction period. The fair value of the award is equal to the average market price, adjusted for the present value of dividends over the vesting period, of our stock on the grant date. Compensation expense is recorded ratably over the period beginning on the grant date until the shares become unrestricted and is based on the amount of the award that is expected to be earned under the plan formula, adjusted each reporting period based on current information.
Restricted common stock is awarded from time to time at no cost to certain employees. Participants are entitled to cash dividends and voting rights. Restrictions limit the sale or transfer of the shares during a defined period. Generally, one-third of the shares become vested and free from restrictions after two years and one-third of the shares issued become vested and free from restrictions each year thereafter on the anniversary of the grant date, provided the participant remains an employee. The fair value of the award is equal to the average market price of our stock on the grant date. Compensation expense is determined at the grant date and is recognized over the four-year restriction period on a straight-line basis.
Compensation expense (net of estimated forfeitures) related to our share-based plans for the year ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was approximately $35million, $40million and $20million, respectively. The excess tax benefit/(deficiency) associated with our share-based plans for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, was $14million, $5million and $10million, respectively.
136 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 17. STOCK INCENTIVE AND STOCK OPTION PLANS (Continued) The total unrecognized compensation expense (net of estimated forfeitures) related to nonvested awards was approximately $39million at December31, 2012, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of less than two years.

The total fair value of restricted shares vested was $3million, less than $1million and $4million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: Years ended December31, 2012 2011 2010 Expected life (years) 5 5 5 Risk-free interest rate 1.05 % 1.87 % 2.26 % Expected volatility 58.98 % 55.39 % 54.23 % Dividend yield 1.3 % 1.3 % 1.4 % Expected life The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding based upon our historical data.
Risk-free interest rate The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon the observed U.S. treasury security rate appropriate for the expected life of our employee stock options.
Expected volatility The expected volatility assumption is based upon the weighted-average historical daily price changes of our common stock over the most recent period equal to the expected option life of the grant, adjusted for activity which is not expected to occur in the future.

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES We have executed restructuring actions primarily in the form of involuntary separation programs in the fourth quarter of 2012. These actions were in response to deterioration in our U.S. businesses and most key markets around the world in the second half of 2012, as well as a reduction in orders in most U.S. and global markets for 2013. We reduced our worldwide professional workforce by approximately 650 employees, or 3percent. We also reduced our hourly workforce by approximately 650 employees. During 2012, we incurred a pre-tax charge related to the professional and hourly workforce reductions of approximately $49million.
Employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. Estimates of restructuring were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded and we may need to revise previous estimates.
We incurred a $1million charge for lease terminations and a $2million charge for asset impairments and other non-cash charges. During 2012, we recorded restructuring and other charges of $52million ($35million after-tax). These restructuring actions included: In millions Year ended December31, 2012 Workforce reductions $ 49 Exit activities 1 Other 2 Restructuring and other charges $ 52 At December31, 2012, of the approximately 1,300 employees to be affected by this plan, 1,130 had been terminated.

EARNINGS PER SHARE We calculate basic earnings per share (EPS) of common stock by dividing net income attributable to CumminsInc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The calculation of diluted EPS assumes the issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive share equivalents outstanding. We exclude shares of common stock held in the EBT (see Note15, "SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY") from the calculation of the weighted-average common shares 140 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC.

NOTE 21. DERIVATIVES We are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. This risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swap contracts, commodity zero-cost collars and interest rate swaps. As stated in our policies and procedures, financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes, and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes. When material, we adjust the value of our derivative contracts for counter-party or our credit risk.
Foreign Exchange Rates As a result of our international business presence, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks. We transact business in foreign currencies and, as a result, our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility, we use foreign exchange forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and third-party sales and purchases denominated in non-functional currencies. Our internal policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flows for up to one year. These foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under GAAP. The effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the forward contract is deferred and reported as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" (AOCL). When the hedged forecasted transaction (sale or purchase) occurs, the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the hedge, unrealized gain or loss, if any, is recognized in current income during the period of change. As of December31, 2012, the amount we expect to reclassify from AOCL to income over the next year is an unrealized net gain of $1million. For the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, there were no circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge.
141 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 21. DERIVATIVES (Continued) To minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, which are considered economic hedges. The objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under GAAP.
The table below summarizes our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts. Only the U.S. dollar forward contracts are designated and qualify for hedge accounting as of each period presented below. The currencies in this table represent 95percent and 98percent of the notional amounts of contracts outstanding as of December31, 2012 and 2011.
Notional amount in millions Currency denomination December31, 2012 December31, 2011 United States Dollar (USD) 110 181 British Pound Sterling (GBP) 227 347 Euro (EUR) 28 47 Singapore Dollar (SGD) 3 20 Indian Rupee (INR) 1,943 1,701 Japanese Yen (JPY) 384 3,348 Canadian Dollar (CAD) 59 39 South Korea Won (KRW) 35,266 36,833 Chinese Renmimbi (CNY) 45 61 Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers. In order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and, consequently, fluctuations in gross margins, we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations. Certain commodity swap contracts are derivative contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges under GAAP. We also have commodity swap contracts that represent an economic hedge but are not designated for hedge accounting and are marked to market through earnings. For those contracts that qualify for hedge accounting, the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss is deferred and reported as a component of AOCL. When the hedged forecasted transaction (purchase) occurs, the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the hedge, if any, is recognized in current income in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs. As of December31, 2012, we expect to reclassify an unrealized net loss of less than $1million from AOCL to income over the next year. Our internal policy allows for managing these cash flow hedges for up to three years.
142 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 21.

(2) A troy ounce is a measurement of mass equal to approximately 31 grams.
In the third quarter of 2012 we began to use a combination of call and put option contracts for copper in net-zero-cost collar arrangements (zero-cost collars) that establish ceiling and floor prices for copper. These contracts are used strictly for hedging and not for speculative purposes. For these zero-cost collars, if the average price of the copper during the calculation period is within the call and put price, the call and put contracts expire at no cost to us. If the price falls below the floor, the counter-party to the collar receives the difference from us, and if the price rises above the ceiling, the counter-party pays the difference to us. We believe that these zero-cost collars will act as economic hedges; however we have chosen not to designate them as hedges for accounting purposes, therefore we present the calls and puts on a gross basis on our Consolidated Balance Sheets .
The following table summarizes our outstanding commodity zero-cost collar contracts that were entered into to hedge the cost of copper purchases: December31, 2012 Commodity Average Floor or Cap Quantity in metric tons(1) Copper call options $ 8,196 4,100 Copper put options 7,005 4,100 (1) A metric ton is a measurement of mass equal to 1,000 kilograms.
Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps. The objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk.
In November 2005, we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our $250million debt issue, due in 2028, from a fixed rate of 7.125percent to a floating rate based on a LIBOR spread. The terms of the swap mirror those of the debt, with interest paid semi-annually. This swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under GAAP. The gain or loss on this derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income as 143 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC.

OPERATING SEGMENTS Operating segments under GAAP are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Cummins chief operating decision-maker (CODM) is the Chief Executive Officer.
Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Components, Power Generation and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. Our engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as in various industrial applications, including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military equipment. The Components segment sells filtration products, aftertreatment, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMsthroughout the world.
We use segment EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, taxes and noncontrolling interests) as a primary basis for the CODM to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments. Segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments.
The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in our Consolidated Financial Statements . We prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We have allocated certain common costs and expenses, 146 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 22. OPERATING SEGMENTS (Continued) primarily corporate functions, among segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal and finance. We also do not allocate debt-related items, actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, changes in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance, flood damage gains or losses, divestiture gains or losses or income taxes to individual segments. In 2012, non-segment items included a $20million reserve ($12million after-tax) related to legal matters and a $6million gain related to adjustments from our 2011 divestitures, while 2011 included the gain on disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business and 2010 included a Brazil revenue tax recovery. These gains were not allocated to the businesses as they were not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year. Segment EBIT may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.

For the year ended December31, 2010, unallocated corporate expenses include $32million in Brazil tax recoveries ($21million after-tax) and $2million in flood damage expenses.
