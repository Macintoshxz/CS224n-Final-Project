These full-service solutions include maintenance contracts, engineering services and integrated products, where we customize our products to cater to specific needs of end-users. Our distributors also serve and develop dealers, predominantly OEM dealers, in their territories by providing technical support, tools, training, parts and product information.
In addition to managing our investments in wholly-owned and partially-owned distributors, our Distribution segment is responsible for managing the performance and capabilities of our independent distributors. Our distributors collectively serve a highly diverse customer base with approximately 44percent of their 2009 revenues being generated from the sale of new engines and power generation equipment, compared to 50percent in 2008, and the remaining revenue generated by parts and service revenue.
Financial information about our distributors accounted for under the equity method are incorporated by reference from Note1, "SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES," and Note2, "INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INVESTEES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements .
During 2008, we purchased a majority interest in three previously independent North American distributors in order to increase our ownership interests in key portions of the distribution channel. The acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and resulted in an aggregate purchase price of $81million which we funded with $54million of borrowings and $27million of cash.
8 Table of Contents The assets of the acquired businesses were primarily accounts receivable, inventory and fixed assets. There was less than $1million of goodwill generated from these transactions.
Our distributors compete with distributors or dealers that offer similar products. In many cases, these competing distributors or dealers are owned by, or affiliated with, the companies that are listed above as competitors of our Engine, Power Generation or Components segments. These competitors vary by geographical location.
JOINT VENTURES, ALLIANCES AND NON-WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES We have entered into a number of joint venture agreements and alliances with business partners around the world. Our joint ventures are either distribution or manufacturing entities. We also own a controlling interest in a non-wholly-owned manufacturing subsidiary.
In the event of a change of control of either party to these joint ventures and other strategic alliances, certain consequences may result including automatic termination and liquidation of the venture, exercise of "put" or "call" rights of ownership by the non-acquired partner, termination or transfer of technology license rights to the non-acquired partner and increases in component transfer prices to the acquired partner. We will continue to evaluate joint venture and partnership opportunities in order to penetrate new markets, develop new products and generate manufacturing and operational efficiencies.

Komatsu Cummins Chile,Ltda.
Komatsu Cummins Chile,Ltda. is a joint venture with Komatsu America Corporation. The joint venture is a distributor that offers the full range of our products and services to customers and end-users in the Chilean market.
Our licensing agreements with independent and partially-owned distributors generally have a three-year term and are restricted to specified territories. Our distributors develop and maintain a network of dealers with which we have no direct relationship. The distributors are permitted to sell other, noncompetitive products only with our consent. We license all of our distributors to use our name and logo in connection with the sale and service of our products, with no right to assign or sublicense the marks, except to authorized dealers, without our consent. Products are sold to the distributors at standard domestic or international distributor net prices, as applicable. Net prices are wholesale prices we establish to permit our distributors an adequate margin on their sales. Subject to local laws, we can refuse to renew these agreements at will and we may terminate them upon 90-day notice for inadequate sales, change in principal ownership and certain other reasons. Distributors also have the right to terminate the agreements upon 60-day notice without cause, or 30-day notice for cause. Upon termination or failure to renew, we are required to purchase the distributor's current inventory, signage and special tools, and may, at our option purchase other assets of the distributor, but are under no obligation to do so. See further discussion of our distribution network under the Distribution segment section above.

SUPPLY We source our materials and manufactured components from leading suppliers both domestically and internationally. We machine and assemble some of the components used in our engines and power generation units, including blocks, heads, turbochargers, connecting rods, camshafts, crankshafts, filters, exhaust systems, alternators and fuel systems. We single source approximately 70 to 80percent of the total types of parts in our product designs. We have long-term agreements with critical suppliers who are the sole source for specific products or supply items. Although we elect to source a relatively high proportion of our total raw materials and component requirements from sole suppliers, we have established a process to annually review our sourcing strategies with a focus on the reduction of risk, which has led us to dual source critical components, where possible. We are also developing suppliers in many global or emerging markets to serve our businesses across the globe and provide alternative sources in the event of disruption from existing suppliers.
PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS We own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture. These patents and trademarks have been granted and registered over a period of years. Although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations, we do not believe any patent, group of patents, or trademark (other than our leading brand house trademarks) is considered significant to our business.
11 Table of Contents SEASONALITY While individual product lines may experience modest seasonal declines in production, there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exception that our Power Generation segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in construction spending during this period and our Distribution segment normally experiences seasonal declines in first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in Asia and Australia.
LARGEST CUSTOMERS We have thousands of customers around the world and have developed long-standing business relationships with many of them. We have long-term heavy-duty engine supply agreements with PACCAR and Volvo Trucks North America. We have mid-range supply agreements with PACCAR, as its exclusive engine supplier, as well as with Daimler Trucks North America (formerly Freightliner LLC), Ford and MAN (formerly Volkswagen). We also have an agreement with Chrysler, for supplying the engine for use in Dodge Ram trucks. Collectively, our net sales to these six customers was approximately 22percent of consolidated net sales in 2009, compared to approximately 21percent in 2008 and 27percent in 2007 and individually was less than nine percent of consolidated net sales to any single customer in 2009, compared to less than eight percent in both 2008 and 2007. These agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing, quality and delivery commitments, as well as engineering product support obligations. The basic nature of our agreements with OEM customers is that they are long-term price and operations agreements that assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements. Agreements with most OEMscontain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach, change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party.
BACKLOG As a result of the current recessed economic conditions many of our order lead times have decreased significantly from lead times in prior years. While we have supply agreements with some truck and off-highway equipment OEMs, most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders. These open orders are historically subject to month-to-month releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE Our research and development program is focused on product improvements, innovations and cost reductions for our customers. We expense research and development expenditures, net of contract reimbursements, when incurred. Research and development expenses, net of contract reimbursements, were $362million in 2009, $422million in 2008 and $318million in 2007. Contract reimbursements were $92million in 2009, $61million in 2008 and $52million in 2007. For 2009 and 2008, approximately 42percent, or $151million, and approximately 27percent, or $116million, respectively, were directly related to compliance with 2010 EPA emissions standards. For 2007, 17percent, or $55million, was related to compliance with 2010 EPA emissions standards. In 2009, we reduced research, development and engineering expenses but continued to invest in critical technologies and products for 2010 and beyond. We will continue to make investments to improve our current technologies, to continue to meet the future emissions requirements around the world and improve fuel economy.
12 Table of Contents ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE Sustainability In 2009, we continued to be a leader in sustainable business development. We have invested significantly in new products and technologies designed to further lower exhaust emissions from our products. We have increased our commitment to addressing the global impact of climate change and have introduced our first set of 10 climate change principles that address ways that we plan to become a greater part of the solution and also articulated our positions on key public policy issues surrounding climate change. For the fourth consecutive year, we were named to the Dow Jones World Sustainability index, which recognizes the top 10percent of the world's largest 2,500 companies in economic, environmental and social leadership. Our sustainability report for 2009 is available on our website at www.cummins.com.
Product Environmental Compliance Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emissions and noise. Our products comply with all current emissions standards that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and other state and international regulatory agencies have established for heavy-duty on-highway diesel and gas engines and off-highway engines. Our ability to comply with these and future emissions standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets. We have made, and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards. Failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results.
EPA Engine Certifications The current on-highway emissions standards came into effect in the U.S. on January1, 2010. To meet the 2010 U.S. EPA heavy-duty on-highway emissions standards, we are using an evolution of our proven 2007 technology solution to maintain power and torque with substantial fuel economy improvement and maintenance intervals comparable with our 2007 compliant engines. We will offer a complete lineup of on-highway engines to meet the near-zero emissions standards. Mid-range and heavy-duty engines for EPA 2010 require nitrogen oxide (NOx) aftertreatment. NOx reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the XPI High Pressure Common Rail fuel system, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology, next-generation cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), advanced electronic controls, proven air handling and the Cummins Particulate Filter. The EPA and CARB have certified that our engines meet the 2010 emission requirements. Emissions standards in international markets, including Europe, Japan, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, India and China are becoming more stringent. We believe that our experience in meeting U.S. emissions standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emissions control capability grows.
Federal and California regulations require manufacturers to report failures of emissions-related components to the EPA and CARB when the failure rate reaches a specified level. At higher failure rates, a product recall may be required. In 2009, we submitted three reports to the EPA relating to two different defects affecting oxidation catalysts and vehicle labels. The oxidation catalyst defect necessitated the campaign of approximately 360 engines.
Other Environmental Statutes and Regulations Expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the U.S. have not been a substantial portion of our annual capital outlays and are not 13 Table of Contents expected to be material in 2010. Except as follows, we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations.
In the U.S., pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies and/or defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions, we have been identified as a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended or similar state laws, at approximately 19 waste disposal sites. Based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be significant. We have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites.
In addition, we have four other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects. The costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material.

Item1A.Risk Factors Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report and could individually or combined have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, future results could be materially affected by general industry and market conditions, changes in laws or accounting rules, general U.S. and non-U.S. economic and political conditions, including a global economic slow-down, fluctuation of interest rates or currency exchange rates, terrorism, political unrest or international conflicts, political instability, major health concerns, natural disasters, commodity prices or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Report, including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our separate section above, "CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION," should be considered in addition to the following statements.
Although the global economy showed mild signs of recovery in late 2009, a further downturn could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows again .
Although we began to see some signs of improvement in late 2009, the global economy remains fragile. The global economic recession that began in late 2008 and continued through 2009 had a significant adverse impact on our business, customers and suppliers. If the global economy were to take another significant downturn, depending upon the length, duration and severity of such a so-called "double-dip" recession, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow would almost certainly be materially adversely affected again. Specifically, our revenues would likely decrease, we may be forced to consider further restructuring actions, we may need to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, our days sales outstanding may increase and we could experience impairments to assets of certain of our businesses.
16 Table of Contents The discovery of any significant problems with our new EPA compliant engine platforms in North America could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows .
We have received EPA and CARB certification for our heavy-duty ISX15 and mid-range ISB6.7, ISC8.3 and ISL9 engines which went into commercial production in early 2010. Certification of these engines confirms that our 2010 engine line-up for on-highway applications meets the near zero emissions levels required for all engines manufactured in 2010. The launch of these new platforms, which includes the introduction of SCR technology, will impact a number of our operating segments and is crucial to our success in North America. Although these engine platforms have undergone extensive testing and we believe that they are ready for production, the discovery of any significant problems in these platforms could result in delays in our product launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, reputational risk and brand risk.
We may need to write off significant investments in our new light-duty diesel engine platforms if customer commitments further deteriorate.
We began development of a new light-duty diesel engine platform in July 2006 to be used in a variety of on- and off-highway applications. Since that time, and as of December31, 2009, we have capitalized investments of approximately $216million. Market uncertainty due to the global recession has resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs, while others remain on schedule. If customer expectations or volume projections further deteriorate from our current levels and we do not identify new customers, we may need to recognize an impairment charge and write the asset down to net realizable value.
We are vulnerable to supply shortages from single-sourced suppliers .
For 2009, we single sourced approximately 70 to 80percent of the total types of parts in our product designs. Any delay in our suppliers' deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations, forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions. Delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers, including capacity constraints, labor disputes, economic downturns, availability of credit, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism. Any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers.
Government regulation could adversely affect our business .
Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, the European Union, state regulatory agencies, such as the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") and other regulatory agencies around the world. We have made, and will be required to continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these regulatory standards. Developing engines to meet changing government regulatory requirements, with different implementation timelines and emissions requirements, makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets. In some cases, we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations, particularly those relating to air emissions. For example, we were required to develop new engines to comply with stringent emissions standards in the U.S. by January1, 2010. While we were able to meet this and previous deadlines, our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve. Further, the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such as delays in product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties.
17 Table of Contents Greenhouse gas legislation or regulation could adversely affect our business.
There is growing consensus that some form of U.S. federal legislation and/or regulation may be forthcoming with respect to regulating manufacturers' greenhouse gas emissions. Any such regulation could result in the imposition on us of significant additional costs in the form of taxes, manufacturing restrictions and/or emission allowances. The impact of any future mandatory greenhouse gas legislative, regulatory and/or product standard requirements on our global businesses is dependent on the design, terms and applicability of the mandate or standard. We are unable to predict whether and/or the extent to which any of these potential requirements will be enacted or imposed upon us.
Our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs .
Our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames; however, the timing of market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions. Additionally, higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. While we customarily enter into financial transactions to address some of these risks, there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, while the use of commodity price hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price. As a result, higher material and commodity costs, as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices, both could result in declining margins.
We are subject to currency exchange rate and other related risks .
We conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. While we customarily enter into financial transactions to address these risks, there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
We also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.
Further deterioration in the North American and European automotive industries could adversely impact our business .
A number of companies in the global automotive industry continue to experience financial difficulties. In North America, General Motors Corporation ("GM"), Ford Motor Company and Chrysler Group,LLC ("Chrysler") have experienced declining markets; furthermore, GM and Chrysler have filed for, and then exited, bankruptcy under Chapter11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code and have accepted substantial monetary infusions from the United States government. Automakers across Europe and Japan are also experiencing difficulties from a weakened economy and tightening credit markets. Because many of our suppliers also supply automotive industry participants, the difficult automotive 18 Table of Contents industry conditions have also adversely affected our supply base. Lower production levels for some of our key suppliers, increases in certain raw material, commodity and energy costs and the global credit market crisis have resulted in severe financial distress among many companies within the automotive supply base. The continuation of financial distress within the automotive industry and our shared supply base and/or the subsequent bankruptcy of one or more additional automakers may lead to further supplier bankruptcies, commercial disputes, supply chain interruptions, supplier requests for company sponsored capital support or a collapse of the supply chain.
Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows .
We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans. Our pension expense and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value. We could experience increased pension expense due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets.
Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets, which could result in increased pension expense in future years and adverse changes to our financial condition. We may be legally required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans in the future, and these contributions could be material. In addition, if local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our pension plans outside the U.S., we could be required to contribute more funds.
We are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business.
Approximately 52percent of our net sales for 2009 were attributable to customers outside the U.S., compared to 59percent in 2008. Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risks include:  the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;  the imposition of withholding requirements on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S.;  the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations;  required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and  changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets.
As we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us.
19 Table of Contents Our business is exposed to risks of product liability claims .
We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products' failure to perform to specification results, or is alleged to result, in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. We may experience material product liability losses in the future. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims. In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful defense of a significant product liability claim could have a material adverse effect upon us. In addition, even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us.
Our products are subject to recall for performance-related issues .
Our products may be subject to recall for performance-related or safety-related issues. Product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation, loss of current and future customers, reduced revenue and product recall costs. Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue.
Our truck manufacturers and OEM customers may not continue to outsource their engine supply needs .
Several of our engine customers, including PACCARInc., Volvo AB and Chrysler, are truck manufacturers or OEMsthat manufacture engines for some of their own products. Despite their engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products, our emissions capability, our systems integration, their customers' preferences, their desire for cost reductions, their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their engine production in the future. Increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers' business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers could have a material adverse effect upon us.
Our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations .
Our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material.
20 Table of Contents We rely on income from investees that we do not directly control.
Our net income includes significant equity, royalty and interest income from investees that we do not directly control. For 2009, we recognized $214million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees. The majority of our equity, royalty and interest income from investees comes from our 13 unconsolidated North American distributors, and from two of our joint ventures in China, Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company,Ltd. ("DCEC") and Chongqing Cummins Engine Company,Ltd. ("CCEC"). Our equity ownership interests in our unconsolidated North American distributors generally range from 30percent to 50percent. We have 50percent equity ownership interests in DCEC and CCEC. As a result, although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities, we do not unilaterally control their management or operations, which put a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these other entities. A significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect upon us.
We face reputational and legal risk from affiliations with foreign joint venture partners .
Several of our joint venture partners are domiciled in areas of the world with laws, rules and business practices that differ from those in the U.S. Although we strive to select joint venture partners who share our values and understand our reporting requirements as a U.S. domiciled company and to ensure that an appropriate business culture exists within these ventures to minimize and mitigate our risk, we nonetheless face the reputational and legal risk that our joint venture partners will violate applicable laws, rules and business practices.
Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new U.S. tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability .
We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision.
Our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S.
President Obama's administration has recently announced proposals for new U.S. tax legislation that, if adopted, could adversely affect our tax rate. The proposed changes that could have an impact include the deferral of certain U.S. income tax deductions and foreign tax credit reform. Although the scope of the proposed changes is unclear, it is possible that these or other changes in the U.S. tax laws could increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our profitability. In addition, as a result of the economic recession, many states are considering new tax legislation to raise revenues and reduce their spending deficits. Implementation of any of these new tax laws could adversely affect us.
We may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters .
As of December31, 2009, we employed approximately 34,900 persons worldwide. Approximately 13,200 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining 21 Table of Contents agreements that expire between 2010 and 2014. While we have no reason to believe that we will be impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters, there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. Any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customers have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slow-downs experienced by our customers could result in slow-downs or closures at vehicle assembly plants where our engines are installed. If one or more of our customers experience a material work stoppage, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
We face significant competition in the markets we serve .
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, fuel economy, speed of delivery, quality and customer support. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of these other companies. For a more complete discussion of the competitive environment in which each of our segments operates, see "Operating Segments" in "Item1 Business." Item1B.Unresolved Staff Comments None.

We also have been identified as a potentially responsible party at multiple waste disposal sites under U.S. federal and related state environmental statutes and regulations and may have joint and several liability for any investigation and remediation costs incurred with respect to such sites, as more fully described in Item1 of this Form10-K under "Environmental Compliance-Other Environmental Statutes and Regulations." We have denied liability with respect to many of these lawsuits, claims and proceedings and are vigorously defending such lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We carry various forms of commercial, property and casualty, product liability and other forms of insurance; however, such insurance may not be applicable or adequate to cover the costs associated with a judgment against us with respect to these lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We do not believe that these lawsuits are material individually or in the aggregate. While we believe we have also established adequate accruals for our expected future liability with respect to pending lawsuits, claims and proceedings, where the nature and extent of any such liability can be reasonably estimated based upon then presently available information, there can be no assurance that the final resolution of any existing or future lawsuits, claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
24 Table of Contents In June 2008, four of our sites in Southern Indiana, including our Technical Center, experienced extensive flood damage. We have submitted a claim for $237million to our insurance carriers, which includes a claim for business interruption. Our insurance carriers have disputed certain aspects of our claim and each party has filed suit against the other. Although we believe that we should be insured against the full amount of such claim, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in pursuing these claims.

In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized us to acquire an additional $500million of our common stock. This authorization does not have an expiration date. In 2008, we acquired $128 million followed by a further $20million in 2009, leaving $352million available for purchase under this authorization at December31, 2009. We announced in February 2009 that we temporarily suspended our stock repurchase program to conserve cash. We lifted the suspension in October 2009 and will from time to time repurchase stock.
During the fourth quarter of 2009, we repurchased 62,937 shares of common stock from employees in connection with the Key Employee Stock Investment Plan which allows certain employees, other than officers, to purchase shares of common stock on an installment basis up to an established credit limit. Loans are issued for five-year terms at a fixed interest rate established at the date of purchase and may be refinanced after its initial five-year period for an additional five-year period. Participants must hold shares for a minimum of six months from date of purchase and after shares are sold must wait six months before another share purchase may be made. We hold participants' shares as security for the loans and would, in effect, repurchase shares if the participant defaulted in repayment of the loan. There is no maximum amount of shares that we may purchase under this plan.

In 2008, we recorded a $433million non-cash charge to equity to reflect losses associated with the effect of market conditions on our pension plans.
28 Table of Contents Item7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our businesses through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements. Our MD&A is presented in the following sections:  Executive Summary and Financial Highlights  Results of Operations  Restructuring and Other Charges  Operating Segment Results  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments  Off Balance Sheet Financing  Application of Critical Accounting Estimates  Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines, electric power generation systems and engine-related component products, including filtration, exhaust aftertreatment, fuel systems, controls and air handling systems. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide. We have long-standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, including PACCARInc., Daimler Trucks North America, Chrysler Group,LLC, Volvo AB, Ford Motor Company, Komatsu, MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG (formerly Volkswagen) and Case New Holland. We serve our customers through a network of more than 500 company-owned and independent distributor locations and approximately 5,200 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories.
Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Power Generation, Components and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. The engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as various industrial applications including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. The Components segment sells filtration products, exhaust aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMsthroughout the world.
Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction and general industrial markets. Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels and our customers' access to credit. Our sales may also be impacted by OEM inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages. Economic downturns in markets we serve 29 Table of Contents generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products. As a worldwide business, our operations are also affected by political, economic and regulatory matters, including environmental and emissions standards, in the countries we serve. At the same time, our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer and the economy of any single country on our consolidated results.
The global economic downturn in 2009 extensively challenged most of our businesses and the markets in which they operate. All of our operating segments incurred double digit declines in net sales and three business units incurred a decrease in EBIT ranging from 44percent to 56percent. Our joint ventures throughout the world also experienced severe downturns in operating results causing income from equity investees to decline 15percent. We experienced significant decreases in market demand for many of our products. The challenging worldwide economy impacted all of our business units in different ways. Our Power Generation and Distribution businesses, which have longer lead times, began to see declines in 2009 while our other businesses started to experience declines in the second half of 2008, especially in the fourth quarter. Demand in most of our markets around the world appears to have reached bottom and we believe those markets have stabilized at these lower levels. We are also seeing improvements in emerging markets including China, India and Brazil. The economy in the United States (U.S.), while showing some signs of recovery, still remains fragile and unemployment continues to remain high. In the second half of 2009, we experienced increased sales in our global engine markets and in North America, we experienced a temporary increase in engine (and related component) demand prior to the 2010 emissions standard change. The increased demand was consistent with sales trends we observed in prior emissions implementations and was the primary reason for sales to U.S. markets increasing to 48percent of total net sales in 2009, compared with 41percent of total net sales in 2008. Throughout the year, we took actions to align our businesses with reduced customer demand, particularly in the first nine months of 2009. These actions included global workforce reductions and closing certain manufacturing operations. Costs associated with these restructuring actions, in conjunction with significantly reduced demand and volumes, negatively impacted our operating results in 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007 results. At the same time, we took actions which enabled us to end the year with a stronger balance sheet. We closely monitored our receivables and customer relationships, reduced inventories 25percent, reduced capital expenditures 43percent and increased our cash and marketable securities by over $0.6billion, generating over $1.1billion in cash from operations. At the same time, we lowered our debt to capital ratio, maintained our credit ratings, improved our pension funding through increased contributions and strong returns and our $1.1billion line of credit remains unused.
As a result of the temporary increase in sales in the second half of 2009, and the challenging economy, we expect new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emission compliant engine and component demand will be weak in the first half of 2010. Excluding the emerging markets, we expect overall demand in most of our businesses to remain at relatively low levels for the first half of 2010.
While we expect overall demand for most of our products to be weak in the first half of 2010, with some improvements in demand in emerging markets, the actions that we initiated in late 2008 and throughout 2009 will continue to enable us to navigate through the challenging economic environment and will position us to respond to market conditions when and where they improve. Our short term priorities remain:  continue to earn a solid profit;  continue to align our cost structure and manufacturing capacity with real demand for our products;  continue to invest in critical technologies, products and capacity; and  continue to demonstrate that we care about our customers more than anyone else.
30 Table of Contents Net income attributable to CumminsInc. was $428million, or $2.16 per diluted share, on sales of $10.8billion, compared to 2008 net income attributable to CumminsInc. of $755million, or $3.84 per diluted share, on sales of $14.3billion. The decrease in income was driven by a 25percent decrease in net sales and a 26percent decrease in gross margin, as we were impacted by lower demand across most of our businesses. Focused cost reduction efforts helped mitigate the impact of lower volumes. Restructuring and other charges in 2009 were $99million ($65million after-tax, or $0.33 per diluted share). For a detailed discussion of restructuring see Note3, "RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements .

The primary drivers were:  Engine segment sales declined by 27percent primarily due to industrial sales decreasing by 40percent and on-highway sales decreasing by 16percent.
Power Generation segment sales declined by 31percent due to declines in all lines of business led by the commercial products line of business.
Components segment sales declined by 25percent due to declines in all lines of business led by the filtration and turbochargers businesses.
Distribution segment sales declined by 18percent.
A more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section.
Gross Margin Significant drivers of the change in gross margins were as follows: In millions 2009 vs. 2008 Increase (Decrease) Volume/Mix $ (1,228 ) Price 252 Production costs 132 Warranty expense 46 Material Costs 13 Currency 8 Other 6 Total $ (771 ) Gross margin decreased by $771million, and as a percentage of sales decreased by 0.4percentage points. The decrease was led by lower volumes which were partially offset by increased engine purchases ahead of the January1, 2010, emissions standards change, improved pricing and decreased production costs. The overall decrease in volumes was due to lower sales resulting from the global economic downturn. Our warranty provision on sales in 2009 was 3.3percent compared to 2.9percent in 2008. Our 2008 warranty expense included $117million recorded in the fourth quarter associated with increases in the estimated warranty liability primarily for certain mid-range engine products launched in 2007. The accrual rates in 2009 for these related engine products were higher than those recorded in 2008 before this change in estimate. As such, our warranty as a percent of sales for these engine families is higher on products sold in 2009 than it was in 2008. Overall, our relative product mix also impacted the rate as a percent of sales when comparing these two periods.
A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease of $74million in discretionary spending, in order to conserve cash, and a decrease of $71million in compensation and related expenses. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable 32 Table of Contents compensation. Salaries and fringe benefits decreased due to severance actions taken throughout 2009. Overall selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 11.5percent in 2009 from 10.1percent in 2008, primarily due to the 25percent decrease in net sales.
Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in the number of engineering projects to conserve cash while focusing on the development of critical technologies and new products and increased reimbursements from third parties for engineering projects. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 3.4percent in 2009 from 2.9percent in 2008, primarily due to the 25percent decrease in net sales.
Equity, Royalty and Interest Income from Investees Equity, royalty and interest income from investees decreased primarily due to the following changes in equity income: Increase/(Decrease) In millions 2009 vs. 2008 Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company,Ltd. (DCEC) $ (22 ) Cummins MerCruiser Diesel,LLC (MerCruiser) (13 ) These decreases were primarily due to lower demand as a result of the global economic conditions. The effects of the global economic downturn were partially offset by modest increases in some markets.
Other Operating (Expense) Income, Net Other operating (expense) income was as follows: Years ended December31, In millions 2009 2008 Flood damage gain (loss)(1) $ 12 $ (5 ) Royalty income 8 12 Royalty expense (7 ) (10 ) Amortization of other intangibles (7 ) (13 ) (Loss) gain on sale of fixed assets (8 ) 5 Other, net 1 (1 ) Total other operating (expense) income, net $ (1 ) $ (12 ) (1) The flood gain represents flood insurance proceeds received during the third and fourth quarters of 2009 which more than offset flood related expenses recognized in 2008 and 2009.
Interest Income Interest income decreased primarily due to lower interest rates in 2009 compared to 2008.
Interest Expense Interest expense decreased primarily due to declining short-term interest rates.
33 Table of Contents Other (Expense) Income, Net Other (expense) income was as follows: Years ended December31, In millions 2009 2008 Foreign currency loss(1) $ (20 ) $ (46 ) Bank charges (14 ) (12 ) Change in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance(2) (4 ) (36 ) Dividend income 5 6 Other, net 18 18 Total other (expense) income, net $ (15 ) $ (70 ) (1) The foreign currency exchange losses in 2009 and 2008 were due to unfavorable currency fluctuations, especially with the British Pound and the Brazilian Real in 2009 and the British Pound, the Euro, the Australian Dollar and the Indian Rupee in 2008.
(2) The change in the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance was due to market deterioration, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, which included the write down of certain investments to zero.
Income Tax Expense Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35percent U.S. income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2009 was 24.4percent compared to 30.6percent for 2008. The decrease is due to tax on foreign earnings, which are subject to lower tax rates, and an increase in research tax credits. Our 2009 income tax provision also includes a $29million (4.5percent) reduction in the fourth quarter related to adjustments to deferred tax accounts. We released $19million (3.0percent) of deferred tax liabilities on foreign earnings, now considered to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. and recorded a deferred tax asset of $10million (1.5percent) related to prior period matters.
We expect our 2010 effective tax rate to be 32percent excluding any discrete items that may arise. The research tax credit expired December31, 2009 and has not yet been renewed by Congress. If the research credit is extended, we would anticipate the 2010 effective tax rate to drop to 30percent.
Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to non-Cummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities. Noncontrolling interests decreased primarily due to lower income of $8million at Cummins India Limited, a publicly traded company at various exchanges in India, as a result of the decline in demand due to the global economic downturn. There were no other individual fluctuations in the subsidiaries that were significant.
Net Income Attributable to CumminsInc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to CumminsInc.
Net income attributable to CumminsInc. and diluted earnings per share attributable to CumminsInc. decreased primarily due to significantly lower volumes, restructuring and other charges and decreased equity income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate.
34 Table of Contents Outlook Near-Term: Many of the markets we serve have slowed significantly as a result of the credit crisis and the challenging global economic environment; however, demand in most of our markets appears to have reached bottom and we are seeing signs that markets have stabilized at these levels. We are also seeing improvement in emerging markets including China, India and Brazil. Consistent with prior emissions standards implementation, the North American on-highway markets experienced increased demand prior to the implementation of the EPA's 2010 emissions standards. Based on our prior experience we expect EPA 2010 engine and component sales to on-highway OEM customers to be very weak in the first half of 2010. In most of our other markets we expect demand to remain stable with current levels for the first half of 2010, while we expect emerging markets to have sales comparable to 2008 levels.
Long-Term: While there is uncertainty in the near-term market as a result of the current economic conditions and market dynamics surrounding the EPA 2010 emissions standards change, we are confident that opportunities for long-term growth and profitability will continue in the future.
2008 vs. 2007 Net Sales Net sales increased in all segments due to the following drivers.
Our commercial power generation business experienced increased demand, especially internationally.
We increased our market share in North American (includes the U.S. and Canada and excludes Mexico) heavy-duty truck and medium-duty truck and bus markets.
Demand in industrial engine markets increased, particularly the international construction and commercial marine markets.
Our Distribution segment benefited from increased demand as well as the acquisition of a majority interest in three previously independent distributors.
Our turbocharger and emissions solutions businesses experienced increased demand.
We had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation.
A detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section.
35 Table of Contents Gross Margin Significant drivers of the change in gross margin were as follows: In millions 2008 vs. 2007 Increase (Decrease) Price $ 402 Volume/Mix 227 Production costs 47 Currency 47 Warranty expense (179 ) Material costs (173 ) Other 13 Total $ 384 Gross margin increased by $384million, and as a percentage of sales increased by 0.9percentage points. Benefits from increased pricing and a more favorable volume/mix of products sold were partially offset by higher material costs reflecting the increase in commodity prices during the year and higher warranty expense. Our warranty expense reflected favorable warranty experience for some engine products and our provision related to sales in 2008 was 2.9percent of sales, down from 3.1percent in 2007. This result was more than offset by negative trends primarily in certain mid-range engine products launched in 2007 for which we recorded additional warranty liability of approximately $117million in the fourth quarter of 2008.
A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased consulting expenses of $36million, increased compensation and related expenses of approximately $34million and the acquisition of a majority ownership interest in three previously independent North American distributors. Increased headcount and compensation and related expenses included salaries, variable compensation and fringe benefits across the business in support of higher volumes and business growth. Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 10.1percent in 2008 from 9.9percent in 2007.
Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses increased significantly, primarily due to higher spending on development programs for future products including increased headcount, compensation and related expenses. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, variable compensation and fringe benefits. Fluctuations in other miscellaneous research and development expenses were not significant individually or in the aggregate. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 2.9percent in 2008 from 2.5percent in 2007.
36 Table of Contents Equity, Royalty and Interest Income from Investees Equity, royalty and interest income from investees decreased primarily due to the following: Increase/(Decrease) In millions 2008 vs. 2007 North American Distributors $ 17 Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company,Ltd. (DCEC) 14 Royalty and interest income 9 Chongqing Cummins Engine Company,Ltd. (CCEC) 8 Shanghai Fleetguard FilterCo.,Ltd.
2 Tata CumminsLtd. (TCL) (6 ) MerCruiser (8 ) Results from our North American distributors increased primarily due to income from a joint venture which we formed in the fourth quarter of 2007. DCEC sales increased largely due to prebuy activity in the first half of 2008 prior to a mid-year emissions change. CCEC increased primarily due to increased sales volumes. TCL experienced decreased sales volumes for the year while MerCruiser profits declined due to significant deterioration in the recreational marine market and increased research, development and engineering expenses.
Other Operating (Expense) Income, Net Other operating (expense) income was as follows: Years ended December31, In millions 2008 2007 Royalty income $ 12 $ 7 Gain on sale of fixed assets(1) 5 22 Flood damage loss (5 )  Royalty expense (10 ) (4 ) Amortization of other intangibles(2) (13 ) (1 ) Other, net (1 ) (2 ) Total other operating (expense) income, net $ (12 ) $ 22 (1) The decrease in the gain on sale of fixed assets was primarily due to the $10million gain on the sale of Universal Silencer in 2007.
(2) The increase in amortization of other intangibles was primarily due to amortization of purchased premiums related to the acquisition of a North American distributor in 2008.
Interest Income Interest income decreased primarily due to lower average cash balances in 2008 compared to 2007.
Interest Expense Interest expense decreased primarily due to declining short-term interest rates and a benefit from our interest rate swap.
37 Table of Contents Other (Expense) Income, Net Other (expense) income was as follows: Years ended December31, In millions 2008 2007 Change in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance(1) $ (36 ) $  Bank charges (12 ) (12 ) Foreign currency (losses) gains(2) (46 ) 28 Dividend income 6 5 Other, net 18 12 Total other (expense) income, net $ (70 ) $ 33 (1) The change in the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance was due to market deterioration, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, which included the write down of certain investments to zero.
(2) The foreign currency exchange losses in 2008 were due to unfavorable currency fluctuations in 2008, especially with the British Pound, the Euro, the Australian Dollar and the Indian Rupee.
Income Tax Expense Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35percent U.S. income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2008 was 30.6percent compared to 32.6percent for 2007. The decrease is primarily due to greater foreign earnings in 2008, which are subject to lower tax rates. Our 2008 income tax provision also included a $10million (0.8percent) reduction in the fourth quarter due to the legislative reinstatement of the U.S. research tax credit.
Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to non-Cummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities. Noncontrolling interests increased primarily due to higher income of $10million at Cummins India Limited, a publicly traded company at various exchanges in India, due to the creation of a new export business in 2008 and favorable price adjustments for high horsepower products. There were no other individual fluctuations in the subsidiaries that were significant.
Net Income Attributable to CumminsInc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to CumminsInc.
Net income attributable to CumminsInc. and diluted earnings per share attributable to CumminsInc. increased primarily due to higher volumes, improved margins, higher equity income and a lower effective tax rate. These increases were partially offset by warranty expense, restructuring charges and investment losses primarily occurring during the fourth quarter of 2008, in addition to unfavorable foreign currency effects.
RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES 2009 Restructuring Actions In 2009, we executed restructuring actions in response to a reduction in orders in most of our U.S. and foreign markets due to the continuing deterioration in the global economy. We reduced our global workforce by approximately 1,000 professional employees. In addition, we took numerous employee 38 Table of Contents actions at many of our manufacturing locations, including approximately 3,200hourly employees, significant downsizing at numerous facilities and complete closure of several facilities and branch distributor locations. Employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans, union contracts or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. Estimates of restructuring were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded and we may need to revise previous estimates.
We incurred $2million of restructuring expenses for lease terminations and $5million of restructuring expenses for asset impairments in response to closures and downsizing noted above. During 2009, we recorded a total pre-tax restructuring charge of $85million, comprising $90million of charges related to 2009 actions net of the $3million favorable change in estimate related to 2008 actions and the $2million favorable change in estimate related to earlier 2009 actions, in "Restructuring and other charges" in our Consolidated Statements of Income . These restructuring actions included: In millions Year ended December31, 2009 Workforce reductions $ 81 Exit activities 7 Other 2 Changes in estimate (5 ) Total restructuring charges 85 Curtailment loss 14 Total restructuring and other charges $ 99 In addition, as a result of the restructuring actions described above, we also recorded a $14million curtailment loss in our pension and other postretirement plans. See Note12, "PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS," to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.
At December31, 2009, of the approximately 4,200 employees affected by this plan, all terminations were substantially complete. If the 2009 restructuring actions are successfully implemented, we expect the annualized savings from the professional actions to be approximately $50million. Our charge related to the professional actions was approximately $30million. Approximately 40percent of the savings from the restructuring actions will be realized in cost of sales, 45percent in selling, general and administrative expenses and 15percent in research, development and engineering expenses. We expect the accrual to be paid in cash which will be funded with cash generated from operations.

These actions were in response to the continued deterioration in our U.S. businesses and most key markets around the world in the second half of 2008, as well as a reduction in orders in most U.S. and global markets for 2009. We reduced our worldwide professional workforce by approximately 650 employees, or 4.5percent. We offered a voluntary retirement package to certain active professional employees in the U.S. based on a clearly defined set of criteria. We also took voluntary and involuntary actions which included approximately 800hourly employees, the majority of which received severance benefits. The compensation packages contained salary and continuation of benefits, including health care, life insurance and outplacement services. The voluntary retirement package was accepted by approximately 150 employees. The remaining professional reductions of 500 employees were involuntary. The expenses recorded during the year ended December31, 2008, included severance costs related to both voluntary and involuntary terminations. During 2008, we incurred a pre-tax charge related to the professional and hourly restructuring initiatives of approximately $37million.
Employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. Estimates of restructuring were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded and we may need to revise previous estimates.
At December31, 2008, of the approximately 1,450 employees affected by this plan, 1,250 had been terminated. All terminations were substantially complete as of December31, 2009. We expect the 2008 restructuring actions to yield approximately $45million to $50million in annual savings from professional actions. Approximately 41percent of the savings from the restructuring actions will be 40 Table of Contents realized in cost of sales, 44percent in selling, general and administrative expenses, and 15percent in research, development and engineering expenses.

OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Power Generation, Components, and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. The engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and RVs, as well as various industrial applications including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. The Components segment includes sales of filtration products, exhaust and aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets, and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs.
We use segment EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, taxes and noncontrolling interests) as a primary basis for the chief operating decision-maker to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments. Segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments.
The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in our Consolidated Financial Statements . We prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a 41 Table of Contents basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We have allocated certain common costs and expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal and finance. We also do not allocate debt-related items, actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, restructuring and other charges, investment gains or losses, flood damage gains or losses, or income taxes to individual segments. Segment EBIT may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.

The following are the primary drivers by market.
Industrial market sales decreased due to deterioration in units sold in the construction, marine and mining markets by 63percent, 45percent and 50percent, respectively.
Stationary power market sales declined due to decreased sales to the Power Generation segment as it used existing inventory to meet declining customer demand.
Medium-duty truck sales decreased significantly due to a 35percent decline in international truck units sold as a result of the global economic downturn. The U.S. market was impacted by the economic downturn; however, this was partially offset by increased sales ahead of the January1, 2010, emissions standards change and improving market share.
Heavy-duty truck sales declined as international units sold were down 64percent. We experienced a decline in Mexican heavy-duty sales due to an increase in heavy-duty truck sales in the first six months of 2008 resulting from the increased activity ahead of Mexico's July1, 2008, new emissions requirements, appreciation of the U.S. dollar and an influx of used trucks into the market from the U.S. and Canada permitted under a new law. Although U.S. truck fleets experienced financial challenges due to a lack of freight and limited access to credit, our U.S. heavy-duty sales ended the year flat as a result of increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 ahead of the January1, 2010, emissions standards change and improving market share.
Total on-highway-related sales were 61percent of total Engine segment sales, compared to 53percent in 2008.
Segment EBIT Engine segment EBIT decreased primarily due to lower gross margin and equity, royalty and interest income from investees which were partially offset by decreased selling, general and 43 Table of Contents administrative expenses and decreased research, development and engineering expenses. Changes in Engine segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December31, 2009 vs. 2008 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ (330 ) (24 )% 0.6 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 57 9 % (1.7 )% Research, development and engineering expenses 45 16 % (0.6 )% Equity, royalty and interest income from investees (45 ) (45 )% NM The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower engine volumes in most markets as a result of the global economic downturn, which was partially offset by increased sales in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2009 ahead of the January1, 2010, emissions standards change, price improvements and by cost reduction activities at our manufacturing plants. Equity, royalty and interest income from investees decreased due to significantly lower demand at DCEC, Komatsu-Cummins Engine Company (KCEC) and Cummins MerCruiser Diesel MarineLLC. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to lower discretionary spending, higher recovery of engineering expenses from third parties and decreased payroll costs as the result of restructuring actions.
2008 vs. 2007 Net Sales Engine segment sales increased compared to 2007. The following are the primary drivers by market.
Heavy-duty sales increased primarily due to an increase in our market share in the North American (includes the U.S. and Canada and excludes Mexico) heavy-duty truck markets, increased Mexican heavy-duty truck sales in the first six months of 2008 resulting from the pre-buy activity ahead of Mexico's July1, 2008, new emissions requirements and weaker demand in the first six months of 2007 resulting from the 2006 pre-buy to replace trucks ahead of the 2007 emissions standards change.
Industrial market sales increased primarily related to strength in commercial marine and construction markets.
Medium-duty truck sales increased due to increased demand in global medium-duty truck markets, primarily due to our market share increases in the North American medium-duty truck market, weaker demand in the first six months of 2007 resulting from the 2006 pre-buy to replace trucks ahead of the 2007 emissions standards change and strong demand in Latin America driven by strong economic conditions in Brazil in 2008.
Stationary power sales increased primarily from intersegment sales to our Power Generation segment, especially internationally.
Medium-duty bus sales increased due to market share gains in the North American bus market.
We had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation.
These increases were partially offset by a 50percent decline in units sold to Chrysler. This decline was due to the deteriorating demand for light duty trucks in North America as the result of the softening U.S. economy and concerns over fuel prices earlier in the year.
44 Table of Contents Total on-highway-related sales were 53percent of total Engine segment sales in 2008, compared to 56percent in 2007.
Segment EBIT Engine segment EBIT decreased primarily due to increased research, development and engineering and increased selling, general and administrative expenses which were partially offset by increased gross margin. Changes in Engine segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December31, 2008 vs. 2007 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ 73 6 % (0.3 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses (30 ) (5 )% (0.1 )% Research, development and engineering expenses (64 ) (29 )% (0.5 )% The increase in research, development and engineering expenses was the result of increased spending on emissions related programs. The increased selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs as the result of salary increases and an increase in the number of segment employees during the year. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to price improvements, especially in industrial engines and parts, and favorable product mix in the on-highway market. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by increased warranty expense from the increased mix of newer emissions-driven products and higher repair costs on certain engines and increased material prices due to higher commodity prices during the year.

The following are the primary drivers by business.
Commercial products business sales decreased due to lower demand across most regions, especially in North America, the United Kingdom (U.K.), the Middle East, Latin America and India.
Alternator business sales decreased due to lower OEM demand in Western Europe, North America and India.
Commercial projects business sales decreased due to lower demand in most regions, especially in North America, Western Europe and the U.K.

The decrease in selling, general and administrative and research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation, lower variable compensation costs, implementation of severance programs and decreased discretionary spending.
2008 vs. 2007 Net Sales Power Generation segment sales increased compared to 2007 primarily due to the following drivers.
Commercial products business sales increased due to strong demand across most regions, especially the U.K., India, Latin America and China.
Commercial projects business sales increased as a result of strong demand across most regions, especially North America, the Middle East, the U.K. and Western Europe.
Alternator business sales increased due to strong international growth, especially in Western Europe and Latin America, and growth in North America.
These increases were partially offset by a significant sales decrease in our consumer business, primarily due to the softening U.S. economy.
Segment EBIT Power Generation segment EBIT increased primarily due to higher gross margin partially offset by increases in selling, general and administrative and research, development and engineering expenses.

For the year ended 2009, the sales for the portion of the business included in emissions solutions were $86million. Sales for the portion of the business included in filtration for the years ended 2008 and 2007 were $136million and $222million, respectively. The 2008 and 2007 balances were not reclassified.
2009 vs. 2008 Net Sales Components segment sales for the year ended 2009 decreased in all businesses versus 2008 as the result of the global economic downturn. The following are the primary drivers by business.
Filtration business sales decreased significantly due to falling global aftermarket and OEM demand, especially in North America and Europe, and the transfer of a portion of the business to emissions solutions in 2009.
Turbocharger business sales decreased significantly due to falling OEM demand in Europe and North America.
Fuel systems business sales decreased primarily due to falling OEM demand in North America and Europe.
48 Table of Contents  Emissions solutions business sales decreased due to falling OEM demand across Europe and North America. These decreases were partially offset by the transfer of a portion of the filtration business into emissions solutions in 2009.
Segment EBIT Components segment EBIT decreased versus 2008, primarily due to a lower gross margin which was partially offset by decreased selling, general and administrative and research, development and engineering expenses. Changes in Components segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December31, 2009 vs. 2008 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ (138 ) (28 )% (0.6 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses 43 19 % (0.6 )% Research, development and engineering expenses 7 7 % (0.7 )% The decrease in gross margin was due to lower volumes for most markets, partially offset by implementation of severance programs. The decrease in selling, general and administrative and research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to implementation of severance programs, closing certain facilities, decreased discretionary spending and decreased research and development spending.
2008 vs. 2007 Net Sales Components segment sales increased compared to 2007 primarily due to the following drivers.
Turbocharger business sales increased due to strong growth in North America, Europe and China, partially due to pre-buy activity in advance of new Euro III emissions standards, which fueled domestic sales in China.
Emissions solutions business sales increased due to strong sales in North America as the result of price increases and North American market share gains.
These increases were partially offset by the sale of Universal Silencer and the discontinuance of a product line in 2007, which contributed a combined $75million in sales in the year ended December31, 2007.
Segment EBIT Components segment EBIT increased primarily due to higher gross margins which were partially offset by increased research, development and engineering expenses, as well as increased selling, 49 Table of Contents general and administration expenses.

The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs and increases in the number of segment employees. The increased research, development and engineering spending was focused on developing new products to meet future emissions standards for both developed and emerging markets.
Distribution Segment Results Financial data for the Distribution segment was as follows: Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December31, 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 In millions 2009 2008 2007 Amount Percent Amount Percent External sales $ 1,777 $ 2,155 $ 1,537 $ (378 ) (18 )% $ 618 40 % Intersegment sales 7 9 3 (2 ) (22 )% 6 NM Total sales 1,784 2,164 1,540 (380 ) (18 )% 624 41 % Depreciation and amortization 17 25 11 8 32 % (14 ) NM Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 125 117 92 8 7 % 25 27 % Interest income 1 2 1 (1 ) (50 )% 1 100 % Segment EBIT 235 242 187 (7 ) (3 )% 55 29 % Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 13.2 % 11.2 % 12.1 % 2.0percentage points (0.9)percentage points Sales for our Distribution segment by region were as follows: Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December31, 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 In millions 2009 2008 2007 Amount Percent Amount Percent Asia Pacific $ 755 $ 812 $ 673 $ (57 ) (7 )% $ 139 21 % Europe, Middle East and Africa 692 1,022 816 (330 ) (32 )% 206 25 % North& Central America 278 260  18 7 % 260 NM South America 59 70 51 (11 ) (16 )% 19 37 % Total sales $ 1,784 $ 2,164 $ 1,540 $ (380 ) (18 )% $ 624 41 % 50 Table of Contents 2009 vs. 2008 Net Sales Distribution segment sales for 2009 decreased versus 2008, primarily due to the decline in power generation equipment and engine sales as a result of the global economic downturn and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable currency impact and the net benefit resulting from full-year 2009 consolidated income from distributor acquisitions with only partial-year 2008 income, sales were down $309million, or 14percent. Decreased sales were led by decreased sales volumes primarily in Power Generation and Engines.
Segment EBIT Distribution segment EBIT decreased primarily due to lower gross margin, partially offset by decreased selling, general and administrative expenses and higher equity, royalty and interest income from investees. Changes in Distribution segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December31, 2009 vs. 2008 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ (86 ) (18 )% (0.2 )% Gross margin, excluding acquisition(1) (94 ) (20 )% (0.7 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses 54 16 % (0.3 )% Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 8 7 % NM (1) Represents the acquisition of one distributor in 2009 partially offset by three distributor acquisitions in 2008.
The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower sales volumes as a result of the global economic downturn and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation, lower sales volumes and decreased discretionary spending.
Acquisition of a business In January 2010, we purchased an additional 50percent ownership interest in Cummins Western Canada, bringing our total ownership interest to 80percent. A new owner purchased the other 20percent interest from the previous owner. The total accounting purchase price of the business is expected to be approximately $105million to $110million. Western Canada recorded revenues of $226million and we recorded equity earnings of $11million for the year ended December31, 2009.
2008 vs. 2007 Net Sales Distribution segment sales increased compared to 2007 as a result of strong organic growth in all regions, mainly in Europe, the South Pacific and the Middle East. We had higher sales of $260million from the acquisition of a majority ownership interest in three previously independent distributors. We had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The higher sales were led by increased sales volumes in power generation, parts and engine volumes, followed by service.
51 Table of Contents Segment EBIT Distribution segment EBIT increased primarily due to higher margins which were partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in Distribution segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December31, 2008 vs. 2007 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ 145 45 % 0.7 % Gross margin, excluding acquisitions(1) 88 27 % (1.9 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses (78 ) (31 )% 1.2 % Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 25 27 % NM (1) The acquisitions represent the consolidation of three new distributors during the year and one new North American joint venture.
The increase in gross margin was primarily due to the increase in sales volumes for power generation, parts and engines followed by service. These increases in gross margin were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs as the result of 2008 salary increases and an increase in the number of segment employees including increased costs related to the acquisition of three new distributors and the North American joint venture.
Reconciliation of Segment EBIT to Income Before Income Taxes The table below reconciles the segment information to the corresponding amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Income : Years ended December31, In millions 2009 2008 2007 Total segment EBIT $ 749 $ 1,322 $ 1,263 Non-segment EBIT(1) (74 ) (102 ) (36 ) Total EBIT $ 675 $ 1,220 $ 1,227 Less: Interest expense 35 42 58 Income before income taxes $ 640 $ 1,178 $ 1,169 (1) Includes intercompany eliminations and unallocated corporate expenses. For the year ended December31, 2009, unallocated corporate expenses include $99million in restructuring and other charges and a gain of $12million related to flood damage recoveries. For the year ended December31, 2008, unallocated corporate expenses include $37million of restructuring charges, a $36million decrease in cash surrender value in corporate owned life insurance and $5million of losses related to flood damage recoveries. There were no significant unallocated corporate expenses in 2007.
52 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Management's Assessment of Liquidity We believe our financial condition and liquidity remain strong despite the difficult environment in the U.S. and global economies. Our strong financial performance, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2009, enabled us to finish the year with minimal debt and sizable cash and marketable securities balances. This cash performance was driven primarily by improved inventory management, controls on capital and discretionary spending and lower repurchases of common stock.
We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity. As of December31, 2009, other sources of liquidity include:  cash and cash equivalents of $930million,  marketable securities of $190million,  $1.07billion available under our revolving credit facility,  $154million, based on eligible receivables, available under our accounts receivable sales program and  $229million available under international and other domestic credit facilities.
The maturity schedule of our existing long-term debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term. Required annual principal payments range from $17million to $67million over each of the next five years.
While the impact of the continued market volatility cannot be predicted, we believe our liquidity will provide us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital, capital expenditures, projected pension obligations, dividend payments, common stock repurchases and debt service obligations.
We have considered the impact of ongoing market instability and credit availability in assessing the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources and are monitoring the impact on our customers and suppliers. We have noticed an impact as reflected in our days sales in receivables, but have not seen a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows in 2009. We expect that general market conditions could impact the rate at which we realize our receivables in the future and could impact eligible receivables under our accounts receivable program, however, we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2010. We will continue to diligently monitor our receivables for potential slowing in collections that could occur as a result of continued difficult economic conditions and our customer's access to credit. The overall decline in market valuations negatively impacted the current value of our pension trusts in 2008; however, pension assets produced strong positive returns in 2009.
At this time, we are comfortable that the currently unused $1.07billion credit capacity under our revolving credit facility is available to us. This assertion is based upon the fact that we drew upon our revolving credit facility, throughout the year, with a prompt repayment, to confirm participation by the banks included in the facility. We successfully tested the facility again in February 2010. As a result, we believe our access to liquidity sources has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment and we do not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, in the debt markets or our credit facilities will not be materially impacted by the ongoing capital market disruptions.
A significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the U.S. More than half of our cash and cash equivalents and most of our marketable securities at December31, 2009, are denominated in 53 Table of Contents foreign currencies. We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The repatriation of cash balances from certain subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations at the local level. We have and will continue to transfer cash from these subsidiaries to us and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so.
Working Capital Summary We fund our working capital with cash from operations and short-term borrowings when necessary. Various assets and liabilities, including short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. As a result, working capital is a prime focus of management attention.
In millions 2009 2008 Change 2009 vs. 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 930 $ 426 $ 504 Accounts and notes receivable 2,004 1,782 222 Inventories 1,341 1,783 (442 ) Other current assets 728 722 6 Current assets 5,003 4,713 290 Accounts and loans payable 994 1,048 (54 ) Current portion of accrued warranty 428 434 (6 ) Other accrued expenses 1,010 1,157 (147 ) Current liabilities 2,432 2,639 (207 ) Working capital $ 2,571 $ 2,074 $ 497 Current ratio 2.06 1.79 0.27 Days' sales in receivables 64 48 16 Inventory turnover 5.2 6.2 (1.0 ) Current assets increased primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents, caused by management's efforts to conserve cash, reduce inventories and limit discretionary spending during the global recession (see Cash Flows below) and an increase in receivables. The increase in receivables was due to higher sales in global engine markets, higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 than in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of a temporary increase in engine (and related component) demand prior to the 2010 emissions standards change and the significant decrease in sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the onset of the economic recession. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in inventories as a result of our efforts to reduce our working capital.
Current liabilities decreased primarily due to a decline in other accrued expenses and accounts payable as a result of reduced purchasing volume and controls around discretionary spending.
54 Table of Contents Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents increased $504million during the year ended December31, 2009, compared to a $151million decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the year ended December31, 2008. The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows: Operating Activities Change Years ended December31, 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 In millions 2009 2008 2007 Net income $ 484 $ 818 $ 788 $ (334 ) $ 30 Depreciation 326 314 290 12 24 Equity in income of investees, net of dividends 23 (45 ) (75 ) 68 30 Pension expense, net of contributions (36 ) (31 ) (152 ) (5 ) 121 Changes in: Receivables (181 ) 88 (203 ) (269 ) 291 Inventory 482 (251 ) (255 ) 733 4 Accounts payable (75 ) (174 ) 136 99 (310 ) Accrued expenses (132 ) 124 217 (256 ) (93 ) Other, net 246 144 64 102 80 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,137 $ 987 $ 810 $ 150 $ 177 2009 vs. 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities increased for the year ended December31, 2009, compared to 2008, primarily due to favorable working capital fluctuations, primarily inventories, as a result of management's response to the challenging global economy and increased dividends from our equity investees which were partially offset by decreased income as the result of declining sales. Management's priorities included reducing inventory, aligning our cost and capacity with the real demand for our products and managing the business to generate positive cash flows by improving our working capital.
Pensions The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets, market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans. As a result of the credit crisis and the related market recession, our pension assets experienced significant deterioration in 2008. The financial market distress of 2008 continued into early 2009 with the debt and equity markets bottoming out in the first quarter. In the second half of 2009, the financial markets began to rebound. The recovery helped to improve our plan performance. Thus, for the year ended December31, 2009, the return for our U.S. plan was above 18percent while our U.K. plan return was above 16percent. The most recent three-year average return for all of our pension invested assets was slightly above one percent. Approximately 94percent of our pension plan assets are invested in highly liquid investments such as equity and fixed income securities. The remaining six percent of our plan assets are invested in less liquid but market valued investments, including real estate and private equity. We made $129million of pension contributions in 2009 and we anticipate making contributions of $175million to $185million to our pension plans in 2010. Expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2010 will meet or exceed the current funding requirements. Claims and premiums for other postretirement benefits are expected to approximate $53million in 2010. The $129million of pension contributions in 2009 included voluntary contributions of $108million. These contributions and payments include payments from our funds either to increase pension plan assets or to make direct payments to participants.
55 Table of Contents 2008 vs. 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities increased for the year ended December31, 2008, compared to 2007, primarily due to decreased pension funding, increased net income as the result of increased sales and increased equity in earnings net of dividends, which was partially offset by unfavorable working capital fluctuations. The unfavorable working capital fluctuation was primarily due to an increase in inventory, which was primarily to support strong business growth while the decreases in accounts payable and accounts receivable were more reflective of early shutdowns in many of our manufacturing facilities at the close of 2008, as demand softened throughout the fourth quarter. The increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to an increase in warranty expense.
Investing Activities Change Years ended December31, 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 In millions 2009 2008 2007 Capital expenditures $ (310 ) $ (543 ) $ (353 ) $ 233 $ (190 ) Investments in and advances to equity investees (3 ) (89 ) (66 ) 86 (23 ) Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired (2 ) (142 ) (20 ) 140 (122 ) Proceeds from the sale of businesses  64 35 (64 ) 29 Investments in marketable securities, net (96 ) 19 (10 ) (115 ) 29 Other, net (98 ) (157 ) (101 ) 59 (56 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (509 ) $ (848 ) $ (515 ) $ 339 $ (333 ) 2009 vs. 2008 Net cash used in investing activities decreased for the year ended December31, 2009, compared to 2008, primarily due to decreased capital expenditures and lower investments in the acquisition of businesses which were partially offset by increased cash paid for investments in marketable securities and lower cash proceeds from the sale of a business. These decreases primarily occurred as a result of management's decision to conserve cash and maintain liquidity during the recession.
Capital expenditures decreased as management tightened capital spending substantially across all business by limiting expenditures to critical projects and investments in development of new products. Despite the expected challenges in some of our markets in 2010, our financial position allows us the flexibility to increase capital expenditures for 2010 to approximately $400million.
2008 vs. 2007 Net cash used in investing activities increased for the year ended December31, 2008, compared to 2007, primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures and higher investments in businesses related to the purchase of three previously independent distributors and the acquisition of Consolidated Diesel Corporation, a manufacturing facility (see Note22, "ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). These increases were partially offset by an increase in cash generated from net investments in marketable securities and the proceeds from the sale of a business.
Capital expenditures for the year ended December31, 2008 increased 54percent over 2007 to support our growth, and included investments to increase capacity and to fund development of our new products. Our investments in capacity improvements and development of new products accelerated across all of our businesses.

Our total debt was $704million as of December31, 2009, compared with $698million at December31, 2008. Total debt as a percent of our total capital, including total long-term debt, was 14.9percent at December31, 2009, compared to 16.7percent at December31, 2008.
2008 vs. 2007 Net cash used in financing activities decreased for the year ended December31, 2008, compared to 2007, primarily due to the decrease in repurchases of common stock, the increase in proceeds from borrowings, the increase in proceeds from sale of stock held by employee benefit trust and an increase in net borrowings under short-term credit arrangements. These fluctuations were partially offset by the increase in dividend payments. Our total debt as of December31, 2008, was $698million compared to $674million as of December31, 2007.
Total debt as a percent of our total capital, including long-term debt, was 16.7percent at December31, 2008, compared to 15.4percent at December31, 2007. The 2008 debt to capital ratio was negatively impacted by a $675million ($433 after-tax) charge to CumminsInc. shareholders' equity to recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.
Revolving Credit Agreement On June30, 2008, we entered into a three-year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders. The credit agreement provides us with a $1.1billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are to be used by us for working capital or other general corporate purposes.
The credit facility matures on June30, 2011. Amounts payable under our revolving credit facility will rank pro rata with all of our other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness. Up to $100million under our credit facility is available for swingline loans denominated in U.S. dollars. Advances under the facility bear interest at (i)a base rate or (ii)a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of our outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. Based on our current long-term debt ratings, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans was 0.75percent per annum as of 57 Table of Contents December31, 2009. Advances under the facility may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs.
The credit agreement includes various covenants, including, among others, maintaining a leverage ratio of no more than 3.0 to 1.0 and maintaining fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.5 to 1.0. As of December31, 2009, we were in compliance with all such covenants, including our leverage ratio of 0.6 to 1.0 and our fixed charge coverage ratio of 22.5 to 1.0.
Repurchase of Common Stock In July 2006, the Board of Directors authorized us to acquire up to eight million shares of Cummins common stock. In 2007, we repurchased approximately $335million of common stock, at an average cost of $55.76 per share, representing approximately six million shares. This concluded the share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in July 2006.
In December 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $500million of Cummins common stock. We began making purchases under the plan in March 2008 and purchased $128million of stock during 2008 at an average cost of $55.49 per share.
We announced in February 2009 that we had temporarily suspended our stock repurchase program to conserve cash. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we lifted the suspension and will from time to time repurchase stock. We purchased $20million of common stock during the fourth quarter at an average cost of $46.52 per common share.
Quarterly Dividends In July 2008, our Board of Directors voted to increase our quarterly cash dividend per share by 40percent resulting in increasing our cash dividends from $0.125 per common share to $0.175 per common share. Cash dividends per share paid to common shareholders for the last three years were as follows: Quarterly Dividends 2009 2008 2007 First quarter $ 0.175 $ 0.125 $ 0.09 Second quarter 0.175 0.125 0.09 Third quarter 0.175 0.175 0.125 Fourth quarter 0.175 0.175 0.125 Total dividends paid to common shareholders in 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $141million, $122 million, and $89million, respectively. Declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon income and liquidity position, among other factors, and is subject to declaration by our Board of Directors, who meet quarterly to consider the dividend payment. We expect to fund dividend payments from cash from operations.
Credit Rating Impact on our Credit Facilities A number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements, such as our revolving credit facility and our equipment sale-leaseback agreements have restrictive covenants and/or pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating. There were no downgrades of our credit ratings in 2009 that have impacted these covenants or pricing modifications.
On March10, 2008, Standard& Poor's (S&P) upgraded our senior unsecured debt ratings from "BBB-" to "BBB" and revised our outlook to stable citing our improved operating performance over the past several years, including during the expected emissions-related downturn in heavy-duty truck 58 Table of Contents demand in 2007, combined with significant on- and off-balance sheet debt reduction, and increased business diversification.
On June17, 2008, Fitch upgraded our senior unsecured debt ratings from "BBB" to "BBB+" citing our recent market share gains and improving credit profile, including improvement in our geographic and business diversification. In the second quarter of 2009, Moody's Investor Service,Inc. and Fitch reaffirmed our credit ratings.
Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy and are subject to change, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. In addition, we undertake no obligation to update disclosures concerning our credit ratings, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Our ratings and outlook as of December31, 2009, from each of the credit rating agencies are shown in the table below.

In February of 2009, we renegotiated our sale and leaseback transaction to extend the term for an additional two years and removed the requirement to provide residual insurance. The lease obligations are included in this line item. See Note14, "COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our sale and leaseback transaction.
(2) We are contractually obligated to fund $70million in 2010; however, our expected range of total pension contributions for 2010 is approximately $175million to $185million. After 2010 our contractual agreement is $65million per year through 2015.
The contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of $56million, all of which is non-current, as of December31, 2009. We are not able to reasonably estimate the 59 Table of Contents period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur.

The agreement also provides us with an option to increase the purchase limitation up to $500million upon approval. As necessary, CTR may transfer a direct interest in its receivables, without recourse, to the financial institution. To maintain a balance in the designated pools of receivables sold, we sell new receivables to CTR as existing receivables are collected. Receivables sold to CTR in which an interest is not transferred to the financial institution are included in "Receivables, net" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets . The maximum interest in sold receivables that can be outstanding at any point in time is limited to the lesser of $400million or the amount of eligible receivables held by CTR. There are no provisions in this agreement that require us to maintain a minimum investment credit rating; however, the terms of the agreement contain the same financial covenants as our revolving credit facility. As of December31, 2009, the amount available under this program was $154million. As of December31, 2009 and 2008, there were no amounts outstanding under this program.
Financing Arrangements for Affiliated Parties In accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements, we may purchase and/or sell products and components from/to the joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties. The transfer price of products purchased from the joint ventures may differ from normal selling prices. Certain joint venture agreements transfer product to us at cost, some transfer product to us on a cost-plus basis and other agreements provide for the transfer of products at market value.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note1, "SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives.
Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP which often requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. Our management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements .
60 Table of Contents Critical accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the recoverability of an investment related to new products, the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs, accounting for income taxes, pension benefits and annual assessment of recoverability of goodwill.
Recoverability of Investment Related to New Products We have capitalized $216million associated with the future launch of our light-duty diesel engine product. Market uncertainty due to the global recession has resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs. We concluded that events and circumstances indicated that these assets should be reviewed for possible impairment at December31, 2009. We used projections to assess whether future cash flows on an undiscounted basis related to the assets are likely to exceed the related carrying amount to determine if a write-down is appropriate. These projections require estimates about product volume and the size of the market for vehicles that are not yet developed. We used input from our customers in developing alternative cash flow scenarios. Our analysis indicated that the assets are recoverable at December31, 2009. If customer expectations or projected volumes deteriorate and we do not identify alternative customers and/or product applications, we could be required to write-down these assets to net realizable value.
Warranty Programs We estimate and record a liability for warranty programs, primarily base warranty and other than product recalls, at the time our products are sold. Our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management's best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action, which generally occurs when it is announced. Our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates, repair costs and the time of failure. Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch, with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch. We generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a factor based upon historical experience only in the first year, a blend of actual product and historical experience in the second year and product specific experience thereafter. Note11, "PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY," to our Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2009 and 2008 including adjustments to pre-existing warranties.
Accounting for Income Taxes We determine our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to 61 Table of Contents realize our net deferred tax assets. At December31, 2009, we recorded net deferred tax assets of $729million. These assets included $151million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $44million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. A more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in Note4, "INCOME TAXES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements .
Pension Benefits We sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the U.S. and the U.K. and to a lesser degree in various other countries. In the U.S. and the U.K. we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded. We account for our pension programs in accordance with employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under GAAP. GAAP requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis. As a result, our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at December31. These assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover rates, actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age, mortality rates and participant withdrawals. The actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions, participant life span and withdrawal rates. These differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the future.
The expected long-term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense. We considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets. The long-term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a 5-year average market value of return. The long-term rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of long-term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income, real estate and other miscellaneous investments. The differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years. The table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension expense for the period 2007-2009 and our expected rate for 2010.
Long-Term Expected Return Assumptions 2010 2009 2008 2007 U.S. Plans 8.00 % 8.25 % 8.25 % 8.50 % Non-U.S. Plans 7.25 % 7.25 % 7.25 % 7.24 % A lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability.
The difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and, under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation (PBO), 62 Table of Contents amortized over future years of service. This is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions. As of December31, 2009, we had net pension actuarial losses of $801million and $364million for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. Under GAAP, the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. As these amounts exceed 10percent of our PBO, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees.
The table below sets forth the net periodic pension expense for the period 2007 through 2009 and our expected expense for 2010.
Net Periodic Pension Expense In millions 2010 2009 2008 2007 Pension expense $ 71 $ 93 $ 71 $ 98 The increase in periodic pension expense in 2009 was due to lower than historical returns on assets driven by the global economic recession. Another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate. The discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension expense are set forth in the table below.
Discount Rates 2010 2009 2008 2007 U.S. Plans 5.60 % 6.20 % 6.10 % 5.60 % Non-U.S. Plans 5.80 % 6.20 % 5.80 % 4.96 % Changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation.
The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in GAAP which suggests the use of a high-quality corporate bond rate. We used bond information provided by Standard& Poors for the U.S. and iBoxx for the U.K. All bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the U.S. and U.K. were high-quality, non-callable bonds (AA- or better) as of December31, 2009. The average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to GAAP accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions.
Our model called for 60years of benefit payments. For the U.S. plans, the sum of the cash flows from the 60 bonds matched the cash flow from the benefit payment stream upon completion of the process. The number of bonds purchased for each issue was used to determine the price of the entire portfolio. The discount rate benchmark was set to the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price.
In developing the U.K. discount rate, excess cash flows resulted in the early years of the 60-year period when the sum of the cash flow from the bonds maturing in later years exceeded the benefit payments in early years, thus no bonds maturing in early years are needed. As a result, the price of the entire portfolio of bonds was too high because all benefit payments were covered with excess cash flow remaining. We made no adjustment to the cash flow and the discount rate was determined as the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price.
63 Table of Contents The table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2010 net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets.
In millions Impact on Pension Expense Increase (Decrease) Discount rate used to value liabilities: 0.25percent increase $ (5 ) 0.25percent decrease 5 Expected rate of return on assets: 1percent increase (28 ) 1percent decrease 28 The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. A higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense. A lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear.
Our investment policies in the U.S. and U.K. provide for the rebalancing of assets to maintain our long-term strategic asset allocation. We are committed to its long-term strategy and do not attempt to time the market given empirical evidence that asset allocation is more critical than individual asset or investment manager selection. Rebalancing of the assets has and continues to occur. The rebalancing is critical to having the proper weighting of assets to achieve the expected total portfolio returns.
For the U.S. qualified pension plans, our assumptions for the expected return on assets was 8.25percent in 2009. Projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. As of December31, 2009, based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our U.S. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20-year projection period equal to or in excess of 7.50percent approximately 40percent of the time while returns of 8.70percent or greater are anticipated 25percent of the time. We expect additional positive returns from active investment management. Except for the short-term adverse conditions in the equity markets in 2008, our recent three-year annual rates of return have all exceeded 8.50percent. As a result, based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 8.00percent per year in 2010 for U.S. pension assets is reasonable. The methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations. Our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long-term outlook. Therefore, the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. Our pension plan asset allocation at December31, 2009 and 2008 and target allocation for 2010 are as follows: Percentage of Plan Assets at December31, Target Allocation 2010 Investment description 2009 2008 Equity securities 55.0 % 59.1 % 56.0 % Fixed income 33.6 % 34.6 % 39.6 % Real estate/Other 11.4 % 6.3 % 4.4 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 64 Table of Contents Actual cash funding for our U.S. pension plans is governed by employee benefit and tax laws and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 ("the Act"). The Act extends the use of an average corporate bond rate for determining current liabilities for funding purposes. Among its many provisions, the Act establishes a 100percent funding target for plan years beginning after December31, 2007, which has now been extended to 2011 by the U.S. Congress due to the recession. Our funding strategy is to make contributions to our various qualified plans in accordance with statutory funding requirements and any additional contributions we determine are appropriate. The table below sets forth our pension contributions for the period 2008-2009 and our expected range of contributions for 2010.
Pension Contributions In millions 2010 2009 2008 Contributions $ 175 - 185 $ 129 $ 102 Contributions beyond 2010 will depend on the funded status of our U.S. plans at that time in relation to the targeted funding established under the Act and contractual obligations negotiated in the U.K.
Our pension plans in the U.S. and outside the U.S. were under-funded at December31, 2009, by a total of $522million due to pension trust asset performance.
Under GAAP, the actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs (credits) are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Increases in actuarial losses reduced our shareholders' equity by $11million (after-tax) in 2009. The increases resulted from lower discount rates and higher mortality assumptions partially offset by improved plan asset performance in 2009.
Note12, "PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS," to our Consolidated Financial Statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity, the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements .
Annual Assessment for Recoverability of Goodwill Under GAAP accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets, the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually. The fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows less requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions. In accordance with GAAP, our reporting units are generally defined as one level below an operating segment. However, there were two situations where we have aggregated two or more components which share similar economic characteristics and thus are aggregated into a single reporting unit for testing purposes. These two situations are described further below. This analysis has resulted in the following reporting units for our goodwill testing:  Within our Components operating segment, emissions solutions and filtration have been aggregated into a single reporting unit. This reporting unit accounts for almost 90percent of our total goodwill balance at December31, 2009.
Also within our Components segment, our turbocharger business is considered a separate reporting unit.
Within our Power Generation segment, our alternator business is considered a separate reporting unit.
Within our Engine segment, our recon business is considered a separate reporting unit. This reporting unit is in the business of remanufacturing and reconditioning engines and certain engine components.
Our Distribution segment is considered a single reporting unit as it is managed geographically and all regions share similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services.
65 Table of Contents No other reporting units have goodwill. Our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue, operating expenses, working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multi-year period. Additionally, management must estimate a weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects a market rate, for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate. The discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and, if less than the carrying value, a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if an impairment loss has occurred. In addition, we also perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how much our forecasts can fluctuate before the fair value of a reporting unit would be lower than its carrying amount. As of the end of the third quarter in 2009, we performed the annual impairment assessment required by GAAP and determined that our goodwill was not impaired. At December31, 2009, our recorded goodwill was $364million, approximately 90percent of which resided in the emissions solutions plus filtration reporting unit. For this reporting unit, a 10percent reduction in our estimated future cash flows would not have impacted our assessment. Changes in our projections or estimates, a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill.
RECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended its existing standards for business combinations, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008. The amended standards make significant changes to both the accounting and disclosures related to the acquisition of a business and could materially impact how we account for future business combination transactions. Because the standard will only impact transactions entered into after January1, 2009, the amended standards did not impact our Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption.
In December 2007, the FASB amended its existing standards for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after December15, 2008. The new standard established accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the accounting for future ownership changes with respect to those subsidiaries. The new standard defined a noncontrolling interest, previously called a minority interest, as the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. The new standard required, among other items, that a noncontrolling interest be included in the consolidated balance sheet within equity, separate from the parent's equity; consolidated net income to be reported at amounts inclusive of both the parent's and noncontrolling interest's shares and, separately, the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and noncontrolling interest all on the consolidated statements of income; and if a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary be measured at fair value and a gain or loss be recognized in net income based on such fair value. We adopted the new standard effective January1, 2009 and applied it retrospectively. As a result, we reclassified noncontrolling interests of $246million, $292million and $253million, respectively, from the mezzanine section to equity in the December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 balance sheets. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the presentation of the current period under the new standard.
In March 2008, the FASB amended its existing standards for disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities, which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after November15, 2008. The new standards require enhanced disclosures about a company's derivative and hedging activities. We adopted the new standard effective January1, 2009 and applied it prospectively. The new disclosures required are included in Note20, "DERIVATIVES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements .
66 Table of Contents In June 2009, the FASB amended its existing standards for subsequent events, which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods ending after June15, 2009 and established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. The new standard established the period after the balance sheet date during which we should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which we should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date and the disclosures that should be made about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements , we evaluated subsequent events through February25, 2010, which is the date our annual report was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective In June 2009, the FASB amended its standards for accounting for transfers of financial assets, which is effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after November15, 2009. The new standard removes the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity from GAAP. The new standard modifies the financial-components approach used in previous standards and limits the circumstances in which a financial asset, or portion of a financial asset, should be derecognized. The new standard also requires enhanced disclosure regarding transfers of financial interests and a transferor's continuing involvement with transferred assets. The new standard will require us to report any future activity under our sale of receivables program as secured borrowings as of January1, 2010. As of December31, 2009, we had no amounts outstanding under this program.
In June 2009, the FASB amended its existing standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, which is effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after November15, 2009. The new standard requires entities to analyze whether their variable interests give it a controlling financial interest of a variable interest entity (VIE) and outlines what defines a primary beneficiary. The new standard amends GAAP by: (a)changing certain rules for determining whether an entity is a VIE; (b)replacing the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary with a more qualitative approach; and (c)requiring entities to continuously analyze whether they are the primary beneficiary of a VIE among other amendments. The new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding an entity's involvement in a VIE. While we are still finalizing our evaluation of the impact of this amendment on our Consolidated Financial Statements , we believe the only impact will be the deconsolidation of Cummins Komatsu Engine Company (CKEC). This deconsolidation will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements . Financial information about CKEC is included in Note23, "VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements .
In October 2009, the FASB amended its rules regarding the accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements. The objective of the amendment is to allow vendors to account for revenue for different deliverables separately as opposed to part of a combined unit when those deliverables are provided at different times. Specifically, this amendment addresses how to separate deliverables and simplifies the process of allocating revenue to the different deliverables when more than one deliverable exists. The new rules are effective for us beginning January1, 2011. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that this amendment will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements .
Item7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. This risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including commodity swap contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps. As stated in our policies and procedures, financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes, and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes. When material, 67 Table of Contents we adjust the value of our derivative contracts for counter-party or our credit risk. The results and status of our hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis. Further information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in Note20, "DERIVATIVES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements .
The following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analysis performed as of December31, 2009. The sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous, parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES As a result of our international business presence, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks. We transact business in foreign currencies and, as a result our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility, we use foreign exchange forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and third-party sales and purchases denominated in non-functional currencies. Our internal policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to one year. These foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under GAAP. The effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the forward contract is deferred and reported as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" (AOCL). When the hedged forecasted transaction (sale or purchase) occurs, the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the hedge, unrealized gain or loss, if any, is recognized in current income during the period of change. As of December31, 2009, the amount expected to be reclassified to income over the next year is not material. For the years ended December31, 2009, and 2008, there were no circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a cash flow hedge.
To minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, which are considered economic hedges. The objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under GAAP.
As of December31, 2009, the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts, would be approximately $31million. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12months. The analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels. It should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items (see Note20, "DERIVATIVES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements ).
INTEREST RATES We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps. The objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk.
In November 2005, we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our $250million debt, due in 2028, from a fixed rate of 7.125% to a floating rate based on a LIBOR spread. The terms of the swap mirror those of the debt, with interest paid semi-annually. This swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under GAAP. The gain or loss on this derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain 68 Table of Contents or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income as "Interest expense." These gains and losses for the year December31, 2009, were as follows: December31, 2009 In millions Income Statement Classification Gain/(Loss) on Swaps Gain/(Loss) on Borrowings Interest expense $ (54 ) $ 54 COMMODITY PRICES We are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers. In order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and, consequently, fluctuations in gross margins, we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations. The commodity swap contracts are derivative contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges under GAAP. The effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss is deferred and reported as a component of AOCL. When the hedged forecasted transaction (purchase) occurs, the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the hedge, if any, is recognized in current income in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs. As of December31, 2009, we expect to reclassify an unrealized net gain of $5million from AOCL to income over the next year. For the year ended December31, 2009, we discontinued hedge accounting on certain contracts where the forecasted transactions were no longer probable. The amount reclassified to income as a result of this action was a loss of $4million. Our internal policy allows for managing these cash flow hedges for up to three years.
As of December31, 2009, the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity swap contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities, was $10million. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12months. The analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels. It should be noted that any change in the value of the swap contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items (see Note20, "DERIVATIVES," to the Consolidated Financial Statements ).

The statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts that are based on management's best judgments and estimates. The other financial information included in the annual report is consistent with that in the financial statements.
Management also recognizes its responsibility for conducting our affairs according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. This responsibility is characterized and reflected in key policy statements issued from time to time regarding, among other things, conduct of its business activities within the laws of the host countries in which we operate, within The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and potentially conflicting interests of its employees. We maintain a systematic program to assess compliance with these policies.
To comply with the requirements of Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we designed and implemented a structured and comprehensive compliance process to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting across the enterprise.
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and concluded it was effective as of December31, 2009. In making its assessment, management utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework.
The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2009, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopersLLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

WARD Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 71 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of CumminsInc.: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CumminsInc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying "Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting". Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The accompanying notes are an integral part of our Consolidated Financial Statements 77 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Operations CumminsInc. (Cummins, the Company, we, our, or us) is a leading global power provider that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines, electric power generation systems and engine-related component products, including filtration and emissions solutions, fuel systems, controls and air handling systems. We were founded in 1919 as one of the first manufacturers of diesel engines and are headquartered in Columbus, Indiana. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide. We serve our customers through a network of more than 500 company-owned and independent distributor locations and approximately 5,200 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories.
Principles of Consolidation Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of all wholly-owned and majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries where our ownership is more than 50percent of common stock except for majority-owned subsidiaries that are considered Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) where we are not deemed the primary beneficiary. In addition, we also consolidate, regardless of our ownership percentage, VIEs for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Where our ownership interest is less than 100percent, the noncontrolling ownership interests are reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets . The noncontrolling ownership interest in our income, net of tax, is classified as "net income attributable to noncontrolling interests" in our Consolidated Statements of Income .
Certain amounts for 2008 and 2007 have been reclassified to conform to the current classifications. All share amounts and per share amounts have been adjusted for the impact of a two-for-one stock split on April9, 2007 and an additional two-for-one stock split on January2, 2008.
Investments in Equity Investees We use the equity method to account for our investments in joint ventures, affiliated companies and alliances in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, generally represented by common stock ownership or partnership equity of at least 20percent but not more than 50percent. Generally, under the equity method, original investments in these entities are recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted by our share of equity in income or losses after the date of acquisition. Investment amounts in excess of our share of an investee's assets are amortized over the life of the related asset creating the excess. If the excess is goodwill, then it is not amortized. Equity in income or losses of each investee is recorded according to our level of ownership; if losses accumulate, we record our share of losses until our investment has been fully depleted. If our investment has been fully depleted, we recognize additional losses only when we are the primary funding source. We eliminate (to the extent of our ownership percentage) in our Consolidated Financial Statements the profit in inventory held by our equity method investees that has not yet been sold to a third-party. Our investments are classified as "Investments and advances related to equity method investees" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Our share of the results from joint ventures, affiliated companies and alliances is reported in our Consolidated Statements of Income as "Equity, royalty and interest income from investees," and is reported net of all applicable income taxes.
Our foreign equity investees are presented net of applicable foreign income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Income . The vast majority of our U.S. equity investees are partnerships 78 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) (non-taxable), thus there is no difference between gross or net of tax presentation as the investees are not taxed.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of the Financial Statements Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts presented and disclosed in our Consolidated Financial Statements . Significant estimates and assumptions in these Consolidated Financial Statements require the exercise of judgment and are used for, but not limited to, allowance for doubtful accounts, estimates of future cash flows and other assumptions associated with goodwill and long-lived asset impairment tests, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, warranty programs, determination of discount and other rate assumptions for pension and other postretirement benefit expenses, restructuring costs, income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances, lease classification, and contingencies. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be different from these estimates.
Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue, net of estimated costs of returns, allowances and sales incentives, when it is realized or realizable, which generally occurs when:  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,  the product has been shipped and legal title and all risks of ownership have been transferred,  customer acceptance has occurred and  payment is reasonably assured.
Products are generally sold on open account under credit terms customary to the geographic region of distribution. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral to secure our accounts receivable. For engines, service parts, service tools and other items sold to independent distributors and to partially-owned distributors accounted for under the equity method, revenues are recorded when title and risk of ownership transfers. This transfer is based on the agreement in effect with the respective distributor and in the United States (U.S.) and most international locations generally occurs when the products are shipped. To the extent of our ownership percentage, margins on sales to distributors accounted for under the equity method are deferred until the distributor sells the product to unrelated parties.
We provide various sales incentives to both our distribution network and our OEM customers. These programs are designed to promote the sale of our product in the channel or encourage the usage of our products by OEM customers. Sales incentives primarily fall into three categories:  volume rebates,  market share rebates and  aftermarket rebates.
79 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) For volume rebates, we provide certain customers with rebate opportunities for attaining specified volumes during a particular quarter or year. We accrue for the expected amount of these rebates at the time of the original sale and update our accruals quarterly based on our best estimate of the volume levels the customer will reach during the measurement period. For market share rebates, we provide certain customers with rebate opportunities based on the percentage of their production that utilizes a Cummins product. These rebates are typically measured either quarterly or annually and are accrued at the time of the original sale based on the current market shares, with adjustments made as the level changes. For aftermarket rebates we provide incentives to promote sales to certain dealers and end-markets. These rebates are typically paid on a quarterly, or more frequent, basis and estimates are made at the end of each quarter as to the amount yet to be paid. These estimates are based on historical experience with the particular program. The incentives are classified as a reduction in sales in our Consolidated Statements of Income .
Rights of return do not exist for a large portion of our sales, other than for quality issues. We do offer certain return rights in our aftermarket business, where some aftermarket customers are permitted to return small amounts of parts and filters each year and in our power generation business, which sells portable generators to retail customers. An estimate of future returns is accrued at the time of sale based on historical return rates.
Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation We translate assets and liabilities of foreign entities to U.S. dollars, where the local currency is the functional currency, at year-end exchange rates. We translate income and expenses to U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates for the year. We record adjustments resulting from translation in a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and include the adjustments in net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying foreign investment.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in current net income. For foreign entities where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, including those operating in highly inflationary economies when applicable, we remeasure inventory, property, plant and equipment balances and the related income statement using historical exchange rates. We include in income the resulting gains and losses, including the effect of derivatives in our Consolidated Statements of Income , which combined with transaction gains and losses amounted to a net loss of $20million in 2009, a net loss of $46million in 2008 and a net gain of $28million in 2007.
Derivative Instruments We make use of derivative instruments in foreign exchange, commodity price and interest rate hedging programs. Derivatives currently in use are foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swap contracts and an interest rate swap. These contracts are used strictly for hedging and not for speculative purposes.
Due to our international business presence, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. We transact in foreign currencies and have significant assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Consequently, our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to benefit from global diversification and after considering naturally offsetting currency positions, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize our existing exposures (recognized assets and liabilities) and hedge forecasted transactions.
80 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) We are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers. In order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and, consequently, fluctuations in gross margins, we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations.
We record all derivatives at fair value in our financial statements. Note20 provides further information on our hedging strategy and accounting for derivative financial instruments.
Income Tax Accounting We determine our income tax provision using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We also recognize future tax benefits associated with tax loss and credit carryforwards as deferred tax assets. Our deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect to recover or settle the temporary differences. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognized in the period that the change is enacted. We reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken. During interim reporting periods our income tax provision is based upon the estimated annual effective tax rate of those taxable jurisdictions where we conduct business.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90days or less at the time of purchase. The carrying amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these investments.
81 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Statements of Cash FlowsSupplemental Disclosures Years ended December31, In millions 2009 2008 2007 Changes in current assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and dispositions, were as follows: Accounts and notes receivable $ (181 ) $ 88 $ (203 ) Inventories 482 (251 ) (255 ) Other current assets 33 (54 ) (34 ) Accounts payable (75 ) (174 ) 136 Accrued expenses (132 ) 124 217 Total $ 127 $ (267 ) $ (139 ) Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds $ 128 $ 349 $ 294 Cash payments for interest, net of capitalized interest $ 31 $ 45 $ 57 Marketable Securities We account for marketable securities in accordance with GAAP standards for the accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. We determine the appropriate classification of all marketable securities as "held-to-maturity, "available-for-sale" or "trading" at the time of purchase, and re-evaluate such classifications at each balance sheet date. At December31, 2009 and 2008, all of our investments were classified as available-for-sale.
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income. Unrealized losses considered to be "other-than-temporary" are recognized currently in income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The fair value of most investment securities is determined by currently available market prices. Where quoted market prices are not available, we use the market price of similar types of securities that are traded in the market to estimate fair value. See Note5 for a detailed description of our investments in marketable securities.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, which approximates fair value, and generally do not bear interest. We have a trade receivables sales program, which is more fully discussed in Note21, which allows us to sell, without recourse, an interest in a pool of our trade receivables to a financial institution as necessary. The allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on our historical collection experience and by performing an analysis of our accounts receivable in light of the current economic environment. We review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis. In addition, when necessary, we provide an allowance for the full amount of specific accounts deemed to be uncollectible. Account balances are charged off against the allowance in the period in 82 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) which we determine that it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows: December31, In millions 2009 2008 2007 Balance, beginning of year $ 10 $ 12 $ 11 Provision for bad debts 11 9 7 Write-offs (9 ) (9 ) (7 ) Other 1 (2 ) 1 Balance, end of year $ 13 $ 10 $ 12 Inventories Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. At December31, 2009 and 2008, approximately 16percent and 18percent, respectively, of our consolidated inventories (primarily heavy-duty and high-horsepower engines and parts) were valued using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost method. The cost of other inventories is generally valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method. Our inventories at interim and year-end reporting dates include estimates for adjustments related to annual physical inventory results and for inventory cost changes under the LIFO cost method. Due to significant movements of partially-manufactured components and parts between manufacturing plants, we do not internally measure, nor do our accounting systems provide, a meaningful segregation between raw materials and work-in-process.
Property, Plant and Equipment We record property, plant and equipment, inclusive of assets under capital leases, at cost. We depreciate the cost of the majority of engine production equipment using a modified units-of-production method, which is based upon units produced subject to a minimum level. We depreciate the cost of all other equipment using the straight-line method with depreciable lives ranging from 20 to 40years for buildings and three to 20years for machinery, equipment and fixtures. Capital lease amortization is recorded in depreciation expense. We expense normal maintenance and repair costs as incurred. Depreciation expense totaled $269million, $262million and $256million for the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Long-Lived Assets We review our long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of the long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. An impairment of a long-lived asset or asset group exists when the expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) estimated to be generated by the asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset or asset group, an impairment loss is measured based on the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the asset or asset group. Assumptions and estimates used to estimate cash flows in the evaluation of impairment and the fair values used to determine the impairment are subject to a degree of judgment and complexity. Any 83 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) changes to the assumptions and estimates resulting from changes in actual results or market conditions from those anticipated may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and could result in a future impairment charge.
Goodwill Under GAAP accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets, the carrying value of goodwill must be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances where impairment may be indicated. The fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows less requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions. In accordance with GAAP, our reporting units are generally defined as one level below an operating segment. However, there were two situations where we have aggregated two or more components which share similar economic characteristics and thus are aggregated into a single reporting unit for testing purposes. These two situations are described further below. This analysis has resulted in the following reporting units for our goodwill testing:  Within our Components operating segment, emissions solutions and filtration have been aggregated into a single reporting unit. This reporting unit accounts for almost 90percent of our total goodwill balance at December31, 2009.
Also within our Components segment, our turbocharger business is considered a separate reporting unit.
Within our Power Generation segment, our alternator business is considered a separate reporting unit.
Within our Engine segment, our recon business is considered a separate reporting unit. This reporting unit is in the business of remanufacturing and reconditioning engines and certain engine components.
Our Distribution segment is considered a single reporting unit as it is managed geographically and all regions share similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services.
No other reporting units have goodwill. Our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue, operating expenses, working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multi-year period. Additionally, management must estimate a weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects a market rate, for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate. The discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and, if less than the carrying value, a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if an impairment loss has occurred. In addition, we also perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how much our forecasts can fluctuate before the fair value of a reporting unit would be lower than its carrying amount. As of the end of the third quarter in 2009, we performed the annual impairment assessment required by GAAP and determined that our goodwill was not impaired. At December31, 2009, our recorded goodwill was $364million, approximately 90percent of which resided in the emissions solutions plus filtration reporting unit. For this reporting unit, a 10percent reduction in our estimated future cash flows would not have impacted our assessment. Changes in our projections or estimates, a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Software We capitalize certain costs for software that are developed or obtained for internal use. Software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives generally ranging from three to five years. Software assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets. Upgrades and enhancements are capitalized if they result in significant modifications that enable the software to perform tasks it was previously incapable of performing. Software maintenance, training, data conversion and business process reengineering costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
Warranty We charge the estimated costs of warranty programs, other than product recalls, to income at the time products are shipped to customers. We use historical experience of warranty programs to estimate the remaining liability for our various warranty programs. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action, which generally occurs when it is announced. We review and assess the liability for these programs on a quarterly basis. We also assess our ability to recover certain costs from our suppliers and record a receivable from the supplier when we believe a recovery is probable. At December31, 2009, we had $10million of receivables related to estimated supplier recoveries of which $5million was included in "Trade and other receivables, net" and $5million was included in "Other assets" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets . At December31, 2008, we had $16million of receivables related to estimated supplier recoveries of which $8million was included in "Trade and other receivables, net" and $8million was included in "Other assets" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets .
In addition, we sell extended warranty coverage on most of our engines. The revenue collected is initially deferred and is recognized as revenue in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services over the contract period. We compare the remaining deferred revenue balance quarterly to the estimated amount of future claims under extended warranty programs and provide an additional accrual when the deferred revenue balance is less than expected future costs.
Research and Development Our research and development program is focused on product improvements, innovations and cost reductions for our customers. We expense research and development expenditures, net of contract reimbursements, when incurred. The major components of research and development expenses are salaries, fringes and consulting fees. Research and development expenses, net of contract reimbursements, were $362million in 2009, $422million in 2008 and $318million in 2007. Contract reimbursements were $92million in 2009, $61million in 2008 and $52million in 2007.
Related Party Transactions In accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements, we may purchase products and components from the joint ventures, sell products and components to the joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties. Joint venture transfer prices to us may differ from normal selling prices. Certain joint venture agreements transfer product to us at cost, some transfer product to us on a cost-plus basis, and others transfer product to us at market 85 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC.

Our related party sales are presented on the face of our Consolidated Statements of Income . Our related party purchases were not material to our financial position or results of operations.
RECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended its existing standards for business combinations, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008. The amended standards make significant changes to both the accounting and disclosures related to the acquisition of a business and could materially impact how we account for future business combination transactions. Because the standard will only impact transactions entered into after January1, 2009, the amended standards did not impact our Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption.
In December 2007, the FASB amended its existing standards for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after December15, 2008. The new standard established accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the accounting for future ownership changes with respect to those subsidiaries. The new standard defined a noncontrolling interest, previously called a minority interest, as the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. The new standard required, among other items, that a noncontrolling interest be included in the consolidated balance sheet within equity, separate from the parent's equity; consolidated net income to be reported at amounts inclusive of both the parent's and noncontrolling interest's shares and, separately, the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and noncontrolling interest all on the consolidated statements of income; and if a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary be measured at fair value and a gain or loss be recognized in net income based on such fair value. We adopted the new standard effective January1, 2009, and applied it retrospectively. As a result, we reclassified noncontrolling interests of $246million, $292million and $253million, respectively, from the mezzanine section to equity in the December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 balance sheets. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the presentation of the current period under the new standard.
In March 2008, the FASB amended its existing standards for disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities, which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after November15, 2008. The new standards require enhanced disclosures about a company's derivative and hedging activities. We adopted the new standard effective January1, 2009, and applied it prospectively. The new disclosures required are included in Note20.
In June 2009, the FASB amended its existing standards for subsequent events, which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods ending after June15, 2009, and established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. The new standard established the period after the balance sheet date during which we should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which we should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date and the disclosures that should be made about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. In preparing our 86 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Consolidated Financial Statements , we evaluated subsequent events through February25, 2010, which is the date our annual report was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective In June 2009, the FASB amended its standards for accounting for transfers of financial assets, which is effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after November15, 2009. The new standard removes the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity from GAAP. The new standard modifies the financial-components approach used in previous standards and limits the circumstances in which a financial asset, or portion of a financial asset, should be derecognized. The new standard also requires enhanced disclosure regarding transfers of financial interests and a transferor's continuing involvement with transferred assets. The new standard will require us to report any future activity under our sale of receivables program as secured borrowings as of January1, 2010. As of December31, 2009, we had no amounts outstanding under this program.
In June 2009, the FASB amended its existing standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, which is effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after November15, 2009. The new standard requires entities to analyze whether their variable interests give it a controlling financial interest of a variable interest entity (VIE) and outlines what defines a primary beneficiary. The new standard amends GAAP by: (a)changing certain rules for determining whether an entity is a VIE; (b)replacing the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary with a more qualitative approach; and (c)requiring entities to continuously analyze whether they are the primary beneficiary of a VIE among other amendments. The new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding an entity's involvement in a VIE. While we are still finalizing our evaluation of the impact of this amendment on our Consolidated Financial Statements , we believe the only impact will be the deconsolidation of Cummins Komatsu Engine Company (CKEC). This deconsolidation will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements . Financial information about CKEC is included in Note23.
In October 2009, the FASB amended its rules regarding the accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements. The objective of the amendment is to allow vendors to account for revenue for different deliverables separately as opposed to part of a combined unit when those deliverables are provided at different times. Specifically, this amendment addresses how to separate deliverables and simplifies the process of allocating revenue to the different deliverables when more than one deliverable exists. The new rules are effective for us beginning January1, 2011. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that this amendment will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements .

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES 2009 Restructuring Actions In 2009, we executed restructuring actions in response to a reduction in orders in most of our U.S. and foreign markets due to the continuing deterioration in the global economy. We reduced our global workforce by approximately 1,000 professional employees. In addition, we took numerous employee actions at many of our manufacturing locations, including approximately 3,200hourly employees, significant downsizing at numerous facilities and complete closure of several facilities and branch distributor locations. Employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans, union contracts or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. Estimates of restructuring were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded and we may need to revise previous estimates.
We incurred $2million of restructuring expenses for lease terminations and $5million of restructuring expenses for asset impairments in response to closures and downsizing noted above. During 2009, we recorded a total pre-tax restructuring charge of $85million, comprising $90million of charges related to 2009 actions net of the $3million favorable change in estimate related to 2008 actions and the $2million favorable change in estimate related to earlier 2009 actions, in 91 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC.

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES (Continued) 2008 Restructuring Actions We executed restructuring actions primarily in the form of voluntary and involuntary separation programs in the fourth quarter of 2008. These actions were in response to the continued deterioration in our U.S. businesses and most key markets around the world in the second half of 2008, as well as a reduction in orders in most U.S. and global markets for 2009. We reduced our worldwide professional workforce by approximately 650 employees, or 4.5percent. We offered a voluntary retirement package to certain active professional employees in the U.S. based on a clearly defined set of criteria. We also took voluntary and involuntary actions which included approximately 800hourly employees, the majority of which received severance benefits. The compensation packages contained salary and continuation of benefits, including health care, life insurance and outplacement services. The voluntary retirement package was accepted by approximately 150 employees. The remaining professional reductions of 500 employees were involuntary. The expenses recorded during the year ended December31, 2008, included severance costs related to both voluntary and involuntary terminations. During 2008, we incurred a pre-tax charge related to the professional and hourly restructuring initiatives of approximately $37million.
Employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. Estimates of restructuring were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded and we may need to revise previous estimates.
At December31, 2008, of the approximately 1,450 employees affected by this plan, 1,250 had been terminated. All terminations were substantially complete as of December31, 2009.

The unremitted income of the U.K. group is considered to be permanently reinvested and the determination of the deferred tax liability, if any, that might be due should that income be distributed is not practicable. During 2009, we released $19million of deferred U.S. tax liabilities related to prior years unremitted income of the Singapore subsidiaries of our U.K. group now considered to also be permanently reinvested. Income before income taxes includes equity income of foreign joint ventures of $117million, $140million and $118million for the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. This equity income is recorded net of foreign taxes. Additional U.S. income taxes of $31million, $30million and $18million for the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, were provided for the additional U.S. taxes that will ultimately be due upon the distribution of the foreign joint venture equity income.

Our foreign carryforward benefits include $20million of net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2013. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the gross deferred tax assets to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. The valuation allowance increased in 2009 by a net $19million and increased in 2008 by a net $1million. The valuation allowance is primarily attributable to the uncertainty regarding the realization of a portion of the U.S. state and foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits.
96 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 4. INCOME TAXES (Continued) On January1, 2007, the FASB amended its existing accounting standards related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The amended standards prescribe a recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and provide guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition rules. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: In millions Balance at December31, 2006 $ 49 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 4 Reductions for tax positions of prior years (4 ) Balance at December31, 2007 $ 49 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 5 Additions based on tax positions related to the prior years 5 Reductions for tax positions relating to settlements with taxing authorities (2 ) Balance at December31, 2008 $ 57 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 1 Additions based on tax positions related to the prior years 4 Reductions for tax positions related to prior years (3 ) Reductions for tax positions relating to settlements with taxing authorities (5 ) Effects of foreign currency translations 2 Balance at December31, 2009 $ 56 Included in the December31, 2009 and 2008, balances are $33million related to tax positions that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate in future periods. Also, we had accrued interest expense related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $22million, $14million and $11million as of December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During the years ending December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized approximately $4million, $2million and $2million in interest expense, respectively.
As a result of our global operations, we file income tax returns in various jurisdictions including U.S. federal, U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. We are routinely subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, India, Mexico, the U.K. and the U.S. Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been examined through 2004. With few exceptions, major U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions are no longer subject to income tax examinations for years before 2004. Various U.S. state and foreign tax audits are currently underway; however, we do not expect any significant change to our unrecognized tax benefits within the next year.

Gross realized gains from the sale of available-for-sale securities were $2million in the year ended 2009 and $1million for each of the years ended 2008 and 2007. Gross realized losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities were less than $1million in 2009, 2008 and 2007.
At December31, 2009, the fair value of available-for-sale investments in debt securities by contractual maturity is as follows: Maturity date Fair value In millions 1year or less $ 34 1-5years 2 5-10years 2 After 10years 1 Total $ 39 NOTE 6. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS In September 2006, the FASB amended its existing fair value standards, which defines fair value, establishes a market-based framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The amended standards are applicable whenever another accounting pronouncement requires or permits assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value. The amended standards do not expand or require any new fair value measures. The standards are effective for financial assets and financial liabilities for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. The FASB issued a partial deferral of the effective date of the amended standards that deferred the effective date for most non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after November15, 2008. We adopted the amended standards prospectively for our fiscal year beginning January1, 2008, except for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities as deferred until January1, 2009. The amended 98 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 6. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued) standards do not require retroactive restatement of prior periods. The adoption did not materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements .
As defined by the amended standards, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable. We primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and utilize the best available information. Accordingly, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The company is able to classify fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. The amended standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level3 measurement). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by GAAP are as follows: Level1Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as listed equities and publicly traded bonds.
Level2Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. Level2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as over-the-counter forwards and options.
Level3Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management's best estimate of fair value. At each balance sheet date, the company performs an analysis of all instruments subject to fair value accounting under GAAP and includes, in level3, all of those whose fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs. At December31, 2009, we did not have any level3 financial assets or liabilities, other than those in our pension plan (see Note12).
The majority of the assets and liabilities we carry at fair value are available-for-sale (AFS) securities and derivatives. AFS securities are derived from level1 or level2 inputs. The predominance of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services.
The fair value measurement of derivatives results primarily from level2 inputs. Many of our derivative contracts are valued utilizing publicly available pricing data of contracts with similar terms. In 99 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 6. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued) other cases, the contracts are valued using current spot market data adjusted for the appropriate current forward curves provided by external financial institutions. We participate in commodity swap contracts, currency forward contracts, and interest rate swaps. When material, we adjust the values of our derivative contracts for counter-party or our credit risk.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (Continued) We have elected to perform the annual impairment test of our recorded goodwill as required by GAAP as of the end of our third quarter. The results of this annual impairment test indicated that the fair value of each of our reporting units as of September27, 2009 and September28, 2008, exceeded their carrying, or book value, including goodwill, and therefore our recorded goodwill was not subject to impairment. The fair value was determined utilizing the expected present value of future cash flows.

For the same respective periods, interest capitalized was $6million, $11million and $5million.
Revolving Credit Facility On June30, 2008, we entered into a three-year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders. The credit agreement provides us with a $1.1billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are to be used by us for working capital or other general corporate purposes.
The credit facility matures on June30, 2011. Amounts payable under our revolving credit facility will rank pro rata with all of our other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness. Up to $100million under our credit facility is available for swingline loans denominated in U.S. dollars. Advances under the facility bear interest at (i)a base rate or (ii)a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of our outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. Based on our current long-term debt ratings, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans was 0.75percent per annum as of December31, 2009. Advances under the facility may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs.
The credit agreement includes various covenants, including, among others, maintaining a leverage ratio of no more than 3.0 to 1.0 and maintaining fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.5 to 1.0. As of December31, 2009, we were in compliance with all such covenants, including our leverage ratio of 0.6 to 1.0 and our fixed charge coverage ratio of 22.5 to 1.0.
The table below is a reconciliation of the maximum capacity of our revolver to the amount available under the facility as of December31, 2009 and 2008. There were no outstanding borrowings under this facility at December31, 2009.

The debentures were redeemable at our option after February15, 2007, at a redemption price of par value plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the debenture holders were not penalized by the early redemption.
Interest on the $250million 7.125% debentures and $165million 5.65% debentures is payable on March1 and September1 of each year. The debentures are unsecured and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. We can redeem the 7.125% debentures and the 5.65% debentures at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the debenture holders are not penalized by the early redemption.
In October 2009, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Cummins BrasilLtda, entered into a loan agreement with the Brazil development bank, BNDES, for a loan in local currency in an amount equivalent to US $45million, at drawdown, at a fixed rate of 4.5percent to finance its exports over the next three years. The principal of the loan has a two-year grace period and will begin amortizing in 2011.
Our debt agreements contain several restrictive covenants. The most restrictive of these covenants applies to our revolving credit facility which will, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional debt or issue preferred stock, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, pay dividends, sell or create liens on our assets, make investments and merge or consolidate with any other person. In addition, we are subject to various financial covenants including a maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. As of December31, 2009, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our borrowing agreements.

The deferred revenue related to extended warranty programs at December31, 2009 and 2008, was $262million and $224million, respectively. The current portion of deferred revenue is included in "Deferred revenue" and the long-term portion is included in "Other liabilities and deferred revenue" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets .
During 2008 and 2009, actual cost trends for certain midrange engine products, including product launched in 2007 and for which warranty periods can extend to five years, indicated higher per claim repair cost than the product on which the initial accrual rate was developed. These products include more electronic parts than historical models contributing to the higher cost per claim. In addition, certain products introduced in 2003 and sold prior to 2007 for which the warranty period extended five years also demonstrated a higher cost per claim than that of predecessor products. We increased our liability in 2008 and 2009 as these experience trends became evident.
NOTE 12. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS PENSION PLANS We sponsor several contributory and noncontributory pension plans covering substantially all employees. Generally, hourly employee pension benefits are earned based on years of service and compensation during active employment while future benefits for salaried employees are determined using a cash balance formula. However, the level of benefits and terms of vesting may vary among plans. Pension plan assets are administered by trustees and are principally invested in equity securities and fixed income securities. It is our policy to make contributions to our various qualified plans in accordance with statutory and contractual funding requirements and any additional contributions we determine are appropriate.

As a result, our pension benefit plans were remeasured and we recognized curtailment losses, as prescribed under GAAP pension standards, due to the significant reduction in the expected aggregate years of future service of the employees affected by the actions. In the third and fourth quarters of 2009, we recorded net curtailment losses of $5million and $1million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans, respectively, and $2million for our less significant plans in other countries outside the U.S. and the U.K. The curtailment losses include recognition of the change in the PBO and a portion of the previously unrecognized prior service cost reflecting the reduction in expected future service.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued) The table below presents various assumptions used in determining the net periodic pension cost and reflects weighted-average percentages for the various plans (Non-U.S. is the U.K.): U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Discount rate 6.20 % 6.10 % 5.60 % 6.20 % 5.80 % 4.96 % Expected return on plan assets 8.25 % 8.25 % 8.50 % 7.25 % 7.25 % 7.24 % Compensation increase rate 4.00 % 4.00 % 4.00 % 4.25 % 4.25 % 4.02 % Plan Assets Our investment policies in the U.S. and U.K. provide for the rebalancing of assets to maintain our long-term strategic asset allocation. We are committed to its long-term strategy and do not attempt to time the market given empirical evidence that asset allocation is more critical than individual asset or investment manager selection. Rebalancing of the assets has and continues to occur. The rebalancing is critical to having the proper weighting of assets to achieve the expected total portfolio returns. We believe that our portfolio is highly diversified and does not have any significant exposure to concentration risk. The plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans do not include any of our common stock.
U.S. Plan Assets For the U.S. qualified pension plans, our assumption for the expected return on assets was 8.25percent in 2009. Projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. As of December31, 2009, based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our U.S. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20-year projection period equal to or in excess of 7.50percent, approximately 40percent of the time, while returns of 8.70percent or greater are anticipated 25percent of the time. We expect additional positive returns from active investment management. As a result, based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we have elected to use an assumption of 8.00percent per year in 2010. The primary investment objective is to exceed, on a net-of-fee basis, the rate of return of a policy portfolio comprised of the following: Asset Class Target Range U.S. equities 31 % 26-36 % Non-U.S. equities 8 % 4-12 % Global equities 16 % 12-20 % Total equities 55 % 50-60 % Real estate 7.5 % 0-10 % Private equity 7.5 % 0-10 % Fixed-income 30 % 25-35 % Total 100 % The fixed income component is structured to represent a custom bond benchmark constructed to closely represent the monthly change in the value of Cummins' liabilities. This component is structured in such a way that its benchmark covers 50percent of the plan's exposure to changes in its discount 109 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 12. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued) rate (AA corporate bond yields). In order to achieve a hedge on more than the targeted 30percent of Plan assets invested in fixed income securities, the Committee may instruct the fixed income managers, other manager(s) or the custodian/trustee to utilize derivative securities in an overlay fashion, which would further reduce the Plan's risk of declining interest rates in what is referred to as a Liability Driven Investment strategy. However, all managers hired to manage assets for the trust are prohibited from using leverage unless specifically discussed with the Committee and allowed for in their guidelines.
UK Plan Assets The methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations. Our strategy with respect to our investments in these assets is to be invested in a suitable mixture of return-seeking assets (equities and property and liability matching assets (bonds) with a long-term outlook. Therefore, the risk and return balance of our U.K. asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. To achieve these objectives we have established the following targets: Asset Class Target Range UK equities 31 % +/- 2.5 % Non-UK equities 22 % +/- 2.5 % Total equities 53 % +/- 2.5 % Real estate 5 % N/A Private equity 2 % N/A Government bonds 40 % +/- 2.5 % Total 100 % As part of our strategy in the U.K. we have not prohibited the use of any financial instrument, including derivatives.

These financial statements are audited at least annually. The fair value of all real estate properties, held in the partnerships, are valued at least once per year by an independent professional real estate valuation firm. Fair value generally represents the fund's proportionate share of the net assets of the investment partnerships as reported by the general partners of the underlying partnerships. Some securities with no readily available market are initially valued at cost, utilizing independent professional valuation firms as well as market comparisons with subsequent adjustments to values which reflect either the basis of meaningful third-party transactions in the private market or the fair value deemed appropriate by the general partners of the underlying investment partnerships. In such instances, consideration is also given to the financial condition and operating results of the issuer, the amount that the investment partnerships can reasonably expect to realize upon the sale of the securities and any other factors deemed relevant. The estimated fair values are subject to uncertainty and therefore may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments existed and such differences could be material.
Estimated Future Contributions and Benefit Payments We plan to contribute approximately $175million to $185million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2010. The table below presents expected future benefit payments under our pension plans: In millions 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015-2019 Expected benefit payments $ 200 $ 203 $ 207 $ 209 $ 214 $ 1,108 Other Pension Plans We also sponsor defined contribution plans for certain hourly and salaried employees. Our contributions to these plans were $42million, $30million, and $25million for the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.
113 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 12. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued) OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS Our other postretirement benefit plans provide various health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees, who retire and satisfy certain age and service requirements, and their dependents. The plans are contributory and contain cost-sharing features such as caps, deductibles, coinsurance and spousal contributions. Company contributions are limited by formulas in each plan. Retiree contributions for health care benefits are adjusted annually and we reserve the right to change benefits covered under these plans. There were no plan assets for the postretirement benefit plans as our policy is to fund benefits and expenses for these plans as claims and premiums are incurred.
Obligations and Funded Status The following tables present the changes in the benefit obligations, the funded status of the plans and the amounts recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for our significant other postretirement benefit plans. Benefit obligation balances presented below reflect the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations (APBO) for our other postretirement benefit plans.

As disclosed in Note3, "RESTUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements , we executed restructuring actions in 2009. As a result, our U.S. postretirement benefit plans were remeasured and we recognized curtailment losses, as prescribed under GAAP other postretirement benefit standards, due to the significant reduction in the expected aggregate years of future service of the employees affected by the actions. In the third quarter of 2009, we recorded net curtailment losses of $6million. The curtailment losses include recognition of the change in the APBO and a portion of the previously unrecognized prior service cost reflecting the reduction in expected future service.
115 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 12. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued) Assumptions The table below presents assumptions used in determining the other postretirement benefit obligation for each year and reflects weighted-average percentages for our other postretirement plans: 2009 2008 Discount rate 5.60 % 6.20 % The table below presents assumptions used in determining the net periodic other postretirement benefits cost and reflects weighted-average percentages for the various plans: 2009 2008 2007 Discount rate 6.20 % 6.00 % 5.60 % Our consolidated other postretirement benefit obligation is determined by application of the terms of health care and life insurance plans, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and health care cost trend rates. For measurement purposes, an 8.5percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed in 2010. The rate was assumed to decrease on a linear basis to 5.0percent through 2017 and remain at that level thereafter. An increase in the health care cost trends of one percent would increase our APBO by $20million as of December31, 2009 and the net periodic other postretirement benefit expense for 2010 by $1million. A decrease in the health care cost trends of 1percent would decrease our APBO by $18million as of December31, 2009 and the net periodic other postretirement benefit expense for 2010 by $1million.
The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 was reflected in the APBO beginning December31, 2004, assuming we will continue to provide a prescription drug benefit to retirees that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare PartD and we will receive the federal subsidy. We received a subsidy of approximately $5million in 2009.
Estimated Benefit Payments The table below presents expected benefit payments under our other postretirement benefit plans and also provides the Medicare subsidy receipts expected to be received: In millions 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015-2019 Expected benefit payments, net of Medicare PartD subsidypostretirement 53 53 51 50 48 199 Medicare PartD subsidy 2 3 3 3 3 12 116 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES We are subject to numerous lawsuits and claims arising out of the ordinary course of our business, including actions related to product liability; personal injury; the use and performance of our products; warranty matters; patent, trademark or other intellectual property infringement; contractual liability; the conduct of our business; tax reporting in foreign jurisdictions; distributor termination; workplace safety; and environmental matters. We also have been identified as a potentially responsible party at multiple waste disposal sites under U.S. federal and related state environmental statutes and regulations and may have joint and several liability for any investigation and remediation costs incurred with respect to such sites, as more fully described in Item1 of this Form10-K under "Environmental ComplianceOther Environmental Statutes and Regulations." We have denied liability with respect to many of these lawsuits, claims and proceedings and are vigorously defending such lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We carry various forms of commercial, property and casualty, product liability and other forms of insurance; however, such insurance may not be applicable or adequate to cover the costs associated with a judgment against us with respect to these lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We do not believe that these lawsuits are material individually or in the aggregate. While we believe we have also established adequate accruals for our expected future liability with respect to pending lawsuits, claims and proceedings, where the nature and extent of any such liability can be reasonably estimated based upon then presently available information, there can be no assurance that the final resolution of any existing or future lawsuits, claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition or cash flows.
In June 2008, four of our sites in Southern Indiana, including our Technical Center, experienced extensive flood damage. We have submitted a claim for $237million to our insurance carriers, which includes a claim for business interruption. Our insurance carriers have disputed certain aspects of our claim and each party has filed suit against the other. Although we believe that we should be insured against the full amount of such claim, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in pursuing these claims.
U.S. Distributor Commitments We had an agreement with a financial institution that provided financing to certain independent Cummins and Cummins Power Generation distributors in the U.S., and to certain distributors in which we own an equity interest. Under this agreement, if any distributor defaulted under its financing arrangement with the financial institution, and the maturity of amounts owed under the agreement were accelerated, then we were required to purchase from the financial institution, at amounts 117 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) approximating fair market value, certain property, inventory and rental generator sets manufactured by Cummins that are secured by the distributor's financing agreement.
In May 2009, the financing agreement with the financial institution was refinanced and Cummins did not make any new commitments, thereby relieving Cummins of responsibility to purchase any assets from the financial institution in event of default by the distributors.
Our distribution agreements with independent and partially-owned distributors generally have a three-year term and are restricted to specified territories. Our distributors develop and maintain a network of dealers with which we have no direct relationship. The distributors are permitted to sell other, noncompetitive products only with our consent. We license all of our distributors to use our name and logo in connection with the sale and service of our products, with no right to assign or sublicense the trademarks, except to authorized dealers, without our consent. Products are sold to the distributors at standard domestic or international distributor net prices, as applicable. Net prices are wholesale prices we establish to permit our distributors an adequate margin on their sales. Subject to local laws, we can generally refuse to renew these agreements upon expiration or terminate them upon written notice for inadequate sales, change in principal ownership and certain other reasons. Distributors also have the right to terminate the agreements upon 60-day notice without cause, or 30-day notice for cause. Upon termination or failure to renew, we are required to purchase the distributor's current inventory, signage and special tools, and may, at our option purchase other assets of the distributor, but are under no obligation to do so.
Residual Value Guarantees We have various residual value guarantees on equipment leased under operating leases. The total amount of these residual value guarantees at December31, 2009, and 2008 was $8million.
Other Guarantees and Commitments In addition to the guarantees discussed above, from time to time we enter into other guarantee arrangements, including guarantees of non-U.S. distributor financing and other miscellaneous guarantees of third-party obligations. As of December31, 2009, the maximum potential loss related to these other guarantees is $75million ($74million of which relates to the Beijing Foton guarantee discussed below).
We have arrangements with certain suppliers that require us to purchase minimum volumes or be subject to monetary penalties. The penalty amounts are less than our purchase commitments and essentially allow the supplier to recover their tooling costs in most instances. At December31, 2009, if we were to stop purchasing from each of these suppliers, the amount of the penalty would be approximately $69million, of which $62million relates to a six year contract with an engine parts supplier that extends from 2008 to 2013. This arrangement enables us to secure critical components important to our growth. Based on current forecasts, we do not anticipate paying any penalties under these contracts.
In July 2008, Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Company, a 50percent owned entity accounted for under the equity method, entered into a line of credit agreement with a borrowing capacity of up to $176million (at current exchange rates). The line is being used primarily to fund equipment purchases for a new manufacturing plant. As a part of this transaction, we guaranteed 50percent of any 118 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) outstanding borrowings up to a maximum guarantee of $88million (at current exchange rates). As of December31, 2009, outstanding borrowings under this agreement were $148million and our guarantee was $74million (at current exchange rates). We recorded a liability for the fair value of this guarantee in accordance with guarantor's accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. The amount of the liability was less than $1million. The offset to this liability was an increase in our investment in the joint venture.
We have guarantees with certain customers that require us to satisfactorily honor contractual or regulatory obligations, or compensate for monetary losses related to nonperformance. Performance bonds and other performance-related guarantees were $75million and $32million as of December31, 2009 and 2008.
We had a standby commitment with Irwin Financial Corporation (Irwin) to purchase up to $25million of its common shares in connection with a potential rights offering being planned by Irwin. Our commitment was subject to the satisfaction of several conditions. On September18, 2009, Irwin Union Bank and Trust Company, Columbus, Indiana, was placed into receivership by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions and Irwin Union Bank, F.S.B., Louisville, Kentucky, was placed into receivership by the Office of Thrift Supervision. In light of these actions, Cummins terminated the Standby Purchase Agreement on September21, 2009, and no further commitments to Irwin remain.
Indemnities Periodically, we enter into various contractual arrangements where we agree to indemnify a third-party against certain types of losses. Common types of indemnities include:  product liability and license, patent or trademark indemnities,  asset sale agreements where we agree to indemnify the purchaser against future environmental exposures related to the asset sold and  any contractual agreement where we agree to indemnify the counter-party for losses suffered as a result of a misrepresentation in the contract.
We regularly evaluate the probability of having to incur costs associated with these indemnities and accrue for expected losses that are probable. Because the indemnities are not related to specified known liabilities and due to their uncertain nature, we are unable to estimate the maximum amount of the potential loss associated with these indemnities.
Joint Venture Commitments As of December31, 2009, we have committed to invest and fund $4million into existing joint ventures in 2010.
Leases We lease certain manufacturing equipment, facilities, warehouses, office space and equipment, aircraft and automobiles for varying periods under lease agreements. Most of the leases are 119 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) non-cancelable operating leases with fixed rental payments, expire over the next ten years and contain renewal provisions. Rent expense under these leases approximated: In millions 2009 2008 2007 Rent expense $ 130 $ 129 $ 113 Following is a summary of the future minimum lease payments due under capital and operating leases, including leases in our rental business discussed below, with terms of more than one year at December31, 2009, together with the net present value of the minimum payments due under capital leases: In millions Capital Leases Operating Leases 2010 $ 32 $ 96 2011 21 69 2012 31 50 2013 17 40 2014 19 33 After 2014 25 85 Total minimum lease payments $ 145 $ 373 Interest (28 ) Present value of net minimum lease payments $ 117 In addition, we have subleased certain of the facilities under operating lease to third parties. The future minimum lease payments due from lessees under those arrangements are $1million per year for the years 2010 through 2014.
Rental Business A significant portion of the equipment in our rental business is financed under capital leases. During the third quarter of 2006, we extended a lease related to a portion of our rental business by six years. The lease was set to expire on September30, 2006. Instead of paying a balloon payment of approximately $42million on September30, 2006, the amount was financed over a six-year term at a fixed rate. In addition to extending this lease, we reduced the interest rate by approximately 2percentage points. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we refinanced a lease related to another portion of our rental business. Under the terms of the agreement which was effective January1, 2007, the new lease has a six-year term with a fixed rate that is approximately 2percentage points lower than the previous lease. The total amount refinanced was approximately $28million. These two leases are with two different lessors. Under each lease we are permitted to prepay, subject to certain conditions, the outstanding balance under the lease for the principal amount outstanding plus a prepayment penalty. For each of these leases we have the option to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term for one dollar. The equipment under these leases is capitalized and amortized over its estimated useful life. As of December31, 2009 and 2008, we had outstanding capital leases under this program of $9million and $43million, respectively. Future lease payments, including repurchase obligations, under each lease are included in the table above.
120 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) Sale and Leaseback Transaction Amendment and Extension During 2001, we entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with a financial institution with regard to certain heavy-duty engine manufacturing equipment. The lease was classified as an operating lease with a lease term of 11.5years, expiring June28, 2013. The financial institution created a grantor trust to act as the lessor in the arrangement. The financial institution owns all of the equity in the trust. The grantor trust has no assets other than the equipment and its rights to the lease agreement with us. On the initial sale, we received $125million from the financial institution which was financed with $99million of non-recourse debt and $26million of equity. Our obligations to the grantor trust consisted of the payments due under the lease and a $9million guarantee of the residual value of the equipment. In addition, we had a fixed price purchase option that was exercisable on January14, 2009, for approximately $35million; however, we decided not to exercise this option.
In December 2003, the grantor trust which acts as the lessor in the sale and leaseback transaction described above was consolidated as a result of the adoption of new accounting standards for variable interest entities, due primarily to the existence of the residual value guarantee. As a result of the consolidation, the manufacturing equipment and the trust's obligations under its non-recourse debt arrangement was included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as property, plant and equipment and long-term debt, respectively. The equity in the trust held by the financial institution was reported as noncontrolling interest. In addition, our Consolidated Statements of Income included interest expense on the lessor's debt obligations and depreciation expense on the manufacturing equipment rather than rent expense under the lease agreement. In April 2008, the trust made the final payment on the non-recourse debt.
In February 2009, we amended the lease agreement to extend the lease for an additional two years to June 2015 and we removed the residual value guarantee. As a result of removing the residual value guarantee, we are no longer required to consolidate the grantor trust and we deconsolidated the trust in the first quarter of 2009. With the deconsolidation, we are now required to account for the leasing arrangement with the trust which qualifies as a capital lease. The deconsolidation of the trust had minimal impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements as the present value of the minimum lease payments (including the extension) approximated the amount that was reported as noncontrolling interest as of the date of the amendment. The reduction in noncontrolling interests and increase in our capital lease liabilities was $35million.
The future lease payments required under the amended lease are as follows: In millions Due date Payment amount 2010 $  2011  2012 12 2013 10 2014 14 Thereafter 4 The lease agreement includes certain default provisions requiring us to make timely rent payments, maintain, service, repair and insure the equipment and maintain minimum debt ratings for our long-term senior unsecured debt obligations.

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY Preferred and Preference Stock We are authorized to issue one million shares each of zero par value preferred and preference stock with preferred shares being senior to preference shares. We can determine the number of shares of each series, and the rights, preferences and limitations of each series. At December31, 2009, there was no preferred or preference stock outstanding.
Common Stock During the second quarter of 2008, our shareholders ratified a proposal to increase our common stock authorization to 500million shares. The Board of Directors authorized a pair of two-for-one splits of Cummins stock in 2007, which were distributed on April9, 2007 and January2, 2008, to shareholders of record as of March26, 2007 and December21, 2007, respectively. All share and per share amounts in this Form10-K have been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock splits.

122 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 15. CUMMINSINC. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (Continued) In July 2007, the Board of Directors voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend per share by 39percent and increased cash dividends to $0.125 per common share in the third and fourth quarters of 2007. Dividends per share paid to common shareholders for the years ended December31, were as follows: Quarterly Dividends 2009 2008 2007 First quarter $ 0.175 $ 0.125 $ 0.09 Second quarter 0.175 0.125 0.09 Third quarter 0.175 0.175 0.125 Fourth quarter 0.175 0.175 0.125 Total dividends paid to common shareholders for the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $141million, $122million, and $89million, respectively. Declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon income and liquidity position, among other factors.
Treasury Stock Shares of common stock repurchased by us are recorded at cost as treasury stock and result in a reduction of shareholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets . From time to time, treasury shares may be reissued as part of our stock-based compensation programs. When shares are reissued, we use the weighted-average cost method for determining cost. The gains between the cost of the shares and the issuance price are added to additional paid-in-capital. The losses are deducted from additional paid-in capital to the extent of the gains. Thereafter, the losses are deducted from retained earnings.
Treasury stock activity for the three-year period ended December31, 2009, consisting of shares issued and purchased is presented in our Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity . For the year ended December31, 2007, we repurchased $335million of common stock, which concluded the share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in July 2006. In 2007, we also converted 0.8million shares from our Employee Benefit Trust into treasury stock. These shares are not considered purchases under the Board authorized purchase plan. In December 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $500million of Cummins common stock. For the years ended December31, 2009 and December31, 2008, we repurchased $20million and $128million, respectively, of common stock under the share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in December of 2007.
Employee Benefits Trust In 1997, we established the Employee Benefits Trust (EBT) funded with common stock for use in meeting our future obligations under employee benefit and compensation plans. The primary sources of cash for the EBT are dividends received on unallocated shares of our common stock held by the EBT. In addition to shares of our common stock held in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), the EBT may be used to fund matching contributions to employee accounts in the 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) made in proportion to employee contributions under the terms of the RSP.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan We have an ESOP Trust that was established in 1989 for certain domestic salaried and non-bargained employees participating in our RSP. The ESOP has a note payable to us which will be funded through future Company contributions to the ESOP Trust.
Our annual cash contributions during plan year 2009, 2008 and 2007 along with dividends received on unallocated shares of our common stock held by the ESOP Trust and cash contributions from the EBT were equal to the required principal and interest payments due under the ESOP notes. Dividends received on allocated ESOP shares are used to purchase shares of our common stock from the Employee Benefit Trust. Those shares are then allocated to the participant accounts. As the debt is repaid, shares are released from the ESOP and are allocated to participants in proportion to their contributions to the RSP. Compensation expense is recorded as shares are allocated to plan participants each year and reduced by the common stock dividends received by the ESOP Trust. Unearned compensation is included in CumminsInc. shareholders' equity and represents compensation expense which will be recorded in the future as the remaining shares are allocated to participants. All shares issued to the ESOP Trust are considered outstanding for purposes of computing earnings per share. Dividends on unallocated ESOP shares can be used to service a portion of the principal and interest due on the ESOP notes.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 17. STOCK INCENTIVE AND STOCK OPTION PLANS In September 2003, our shareholders approved the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan (The Plan), which replaced and succeeded the 1993 Stock Incentive Plan. The Plan, as amended February 2009, allows for the granting of up to $13.5million stock-based awards to executives and employees, of which one-half must be in the form of stock options. Awards available for grant under the plan include, but are not limited to, stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, restricted stock and other stock awards.
Stock options are generally granted with a strike price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant, a life of 10years and a two-year vesting period. Compensation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the vesting period beginning on the grant date. The compensation expense is based on the fair value of each option grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Options granted to employees eligible for retirement under the Company's retirement plan are fully expensed as of the grant date.
Stock options are also awarded through the Key Employee Stock Investment Plan (KESIP) which allows certain employees, other than officers, to purchase shares of common stock on an installment basis up to an established credit limit. Fifty stock options are granted for every even block of 100 KESIP shares purchased by the employee. The options granted through the KESIP program are considered awards under The Plan and are vested immediately. Compensation expense for stock options granted through the KESIP program is recorded based on the fair value of each option grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Performance shares are granted as target awards and are earned based on our return on equity (ROE) performance. A payout factor has been established ranging from zero to 200percent of the target award based on the actual ROE performance during the two-year period. Any shares earned are then restricted for one additional year. Employees leaving the company prior to the end of the restriction period forfeit their shares. Compensation expense is recorded ratably over the period beginning on the grant date until the shares become unrestricted and is based on the amount of the award that is expected to be earned under the plan formula, adjusted each reporting period based on current information.
Restricted common stock is awarded from time to time at no cost to certain employees. Participants are entitled to cash dividends and voting rights. Restrictions limit the sale or transfer of the shares during a defined period. Generally, one-third of the shares are released after two years and one-third of the shares issued are released each year thereafter on the anniversary of the grant date, provided the participant remains an employee. Compensation expense is determined at the grant date and is recognized over the four-year restriction period on a straight-line basis.
Compensation expense (net of estimated forfeitures) related to our share-based plans for the year ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was approximately $20million, $28million and $28million, respectively. The excess tax deficiency/benefit associated with our share-based plans for the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, was $(1) million, $13million and $11million, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation expense (net of estimated forfeitures) related to nonvested awards was approximately $6million at December31, 2009, and was expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of less than one year.

The total fair value of restricted shares vested during the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008 was $2million each and zero for the year ended December31, 2007.
The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: Years ended December31, 2009 2008 2007 Expected life (years) 5 7 7 Risk-free interest rate 2.55 % 3.2 % 4.4 % Expected volatility 50.55 % 49.6 % 24.0 % Dividend yield 1.5 % 1.3 % 1.5 % Expected life The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding based upon our historical data.
Risk-free interest rate The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon the observed U.S. treasury security rate appropriate for the expected life of our employee stock options.
Expected volatility The expected volatility assumption is based upon the weighted-average historical daily price changes of our common stock over the most recent period equal to the expected option life of the grant, adjusted for activity which is not expected to occur in the future.
Dividend yield The dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts.

NOTE 20. DERIVATIVES We are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. This risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swap contracts and interest rate swaps. As stated in our policies and procedures, financial derivatives are used expressly for 129 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 20. DERIVATIVES (Continued) hedging purposes, and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes. When material, we adjust the value of our derivative contracts for counter-party or our credit risk. The results and status of our hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis.
Foreign Exchange Rates As a result of our international business presence, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks. We transact business in foreign currencies and, as a result our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility, we use foreign exchange forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and third-party sales and purchases denominated in non-functional currencies. Our internal policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to one year. These foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under GAAP. The effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the forward contract is deferred and reported as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" (AOCL). When the hedged forecasted transaction (sale or purchase) occurs, the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the hedge, unrealized gain or loss, if any, is recognized in current income during the period of change. As of December31, 2009, the amount expected to be reclassified to income over the next year is not material. For the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008, there were no circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a cash flow hedge.
To minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, which are considered economic hedges. The objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under GAAP.
The table below summarizes our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts. The currencies in this table represent 93percent of the notional amounts of contracts outstanding as of December31, 2009.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 20. DERIVATIVES (Continued) Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers. In order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and, consequently, fluctuations in gross margins, we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations. The commodity swap contracts are derivative contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges under GAAP. The effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss is deferred and reported as a component of AOCL. When the hedged forecasted transaction (purchase) occurs, the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the hedge, if any, is recognized in current income in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs. As of December31, 2009, we expect to reclassify an unrealized net gain of $5million from AOCL to income over the next year. For the year ended December31, 2009, we discontinued hedge accounting on certain contracts where the forecasted transactions were no longer probable. The amount reclassified to income as a result of this action was a loss of $4million. For the year ended December31, 2008, there were no material circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a cash flow hedge. Our internal policy allows for managing these cash flow hedges for up to three years.

(2) A troy ounce is a measurement of mass equal to approximately 31 grams.
Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps. The objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk.
In November 2005, we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our $250million debt, due in 2028, from a fixed rate of 7.125% to a floating rate based on a LIBOR spread. The terms of the swap mirror those of the debt, with interest paid semi-annually. This swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under GAAP. The gain or loss on this derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain 131 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 20.

SALES OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE In January 2004, we entered into a three-year facility agreement with a financial institution to sell a designated pool of trade receivables to Cummins Trade Receivables,LLC (CTR), a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary. In July 2007, we amended the agreement to extend the facility until July 2010, and raised the purchase limitation from $200million to $400million. The agreement also provides us with an option to increase the purchase limitation up to $500million upon approval. As 133 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 21. SALES OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (Continued) necessary, CTR may transfer a direct interest in its receivables, without recourse, to the financial institution. To maintain a balance in the designated pools of receivables sold, we sell new receivables to CTR as existing receivables are collected. Receivables sold to CTR in which an interest is not transferred to the financial institution are included in "Receivables, net" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets . The maximum interest in sold receivables that can be outstanding at any point in time is limited to the lesser of $400million or the amount of eligible receivables held by CTR. There are no provisions in this agreement that require us to maintain a minimum investment credit rating; however, the terms of the agreement contain the same financial covenants as our revolving credit facility (see Note10). As of December31, 2009, the amount available under this program was $154million. As of December31, 2009 and 2008, there were no amounts outstanding under this program.
No accounts receivable sold to CTR were written off during 2009, 2008 or 2007. The sold receivables servicing portfolio, which is included in receivables and the proceeds from the sale of receivables and other related cash flows are as follows: As of and for the years ended December31, In millions 2009 2008 2007 Sold receivables servicing portfolio $ 806 $ 652 $ 759 Receivables sold to special purpose subsidiary 5,424 6,694 6,615 Collections reinvested in special purpose subsidiary 5,270 6,801 6,575 Servicing fees and interest 3 1 1 NOTE 22. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES During 2008, we purchased a majority interest in three previously independent North American distributors in order to increase our ownership interests in key portions of the distribution channel. The acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and resulted in an aggregate purchase price of $81million which we funded with $54million of borrowings and $27million of cash. The assets of the acquired businesses were primarily accounts receivable, inventory and fixed assets. There was less than $1million of goodwill generated from these transactions. During the first three months of 2007, we purchased the remaining interest in a manufacturing joint venture and acquired ownership of an international independent distributor for approximately $20million. We recorded goodwill of $13million for these two transactions.
In July 2008, we entered into a transaction with two Fiat group companies to (1)sell our one-third interest in the European Engine Alliance (EEA) joint venture and simultaneously (2)purchase the remaining 50percent interest in CDC. As a result, we now own 100percent of CDC and no longer have an ownership interest in EEA. CDC was previously included in our consolidated results as we were considered the primary beneficiary under GAAP. We sold our remaining interest in EEA for $64million and subsequently purchased the remaining interest in CDC for $61million, however, because the transactions were entered into simultaneously with the same counterparty, it is considered a non-monetary exchange for accounting purposes. Thus, we accounted for the transactions at fair value in accordance with GAAP accounting for exchanges of nonmonetary assets. Because fair value and book value were reasonably close, there was no material gain or loss recorded on the sale of EEA. In addition, there were no significant adjustments from book value for any assets or liabilities of CDC recorded upon the acquisition of the remaining 50percent interest.
134 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 23. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES We consolidate certain VIEs if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary, defined in FASB standards for consolidation of variable interest entities, as the entity that absorbs a majority of the VIEs' expected losses, receives a majority of the VIEs' expected residual returns, or both. We have variable interests in certain businesses accounted for under the equity method of accounting that are deemed VIEs and are subject to the provisions of GAAP accounting for variable interest entities.
During 2001, we entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with a financial institution with regard to certain heavy-duty engine manufacturing equipment. The accounting for the original sale-leaseback transaction is discussed in Note14. The financial institution created a grantor trust to act as the lessor in the arrangement. The financial institution owns 100percent of the equity in the trust. The grantor trust has no assets other than the equipment and its rights to the lease agreement with us. On the initial sale, we received $125million from the financial institution which was financed with $99million of non-recourse debt and $26million of equity. Our obligations to the grantor trust consist of the payments due under the lease and a $9million guarantee of the residual value of the equipment. In addition, we had a fixed price purchase option that was exercisable on January14, 2009, for approximately $35million; however, we decided not to exercise this option as discussed in Note14.
We had previously determined that the grantor trust is a VIE under GAAP and due primarily to the existence of the residual value guarantee, we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of the VIE. As a result, we began consolidating the grantor trust as of December31, 2003, even though we do not own any of its equity. In April 2008, we made the final payment on the non-recourse debt. As further discussed in Note14, we amended our lease agreement in January 2009 to remove the residual value guarantee and as a result, determined that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of the trust.
Cummins Komatsu Engine Corporation (CKEC) is an engine manufacturing entity jointly owned and operated by us and our equity partner. We were deemed the primary beneficiary of this VIE due to the pricing arrangements of purchases and the substantial volume of purchases we made from the VIE. As of December31, 2009, CKEC has no unsecured debt. Creditors of this entity have no recourse to our general credit. Conversely, our creditors have no recourse to the assets of CKEC.
Results of CKEC for the year ended December31, 2009, are included in our Consolidated Statements of Income and a significant amount of their sales is eliminated in consolidation. The table below shows the amount of assets and liabilities from CKEC included in our consolidated results, after eliminating intercompany items, as of December31, 2009: In millions Current assets (Primarily receivables and inventory) $ 9 Long-term assets 10 Current liabilities 3 We also have variable interests in two North American distributors that were deemed to be VIEs in accordance with GAAP, but we were not deemed to be the primary beneficiary since we do not absorb a majority of the entity's expected losses. Our ownership percentage in these entities ranges from 30percent to 36percent. For both of these entities, our equity ownership represents our only variable interest in the entity and thus we would not be deemed the primary beneficiary.
135 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 23. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (Continued) The principal business of the distributors is to sell Cummins engines and related service parts as well as provide repair and maintenance services on engines, including warranty repairs. Our maximum potential loss related to these distributors as of December31, 2009, consisted of our ownership interest totaling $21million. In addition, under certain circumstances, we could be required to repurchase certain assets of these distributors at amounts approximating fair value as more fully discussed in Note14. Our involvement with these distributors as equity holders began in 2005 and 2003. Selected financial information for these distributors as of and for the year ended December31, 2009, is as follows: In millions Total assets $ 154 Total liabilities (including total debt of $34) 79 Revenues 378 Net income 43 In January 2010, we purchased an additional 50percent ownership interest in Cummins Western Canada, bringing our total ownership interest to 80percent. Western Canada will cease to be a variable interest entity in 2010.
CDC was an engine manufacturing entity jointly owned 50/50 by us and our equity partners. In 2006, 2007 and the first six months of 2008, we consolidated this entity under GAAP due to the pricing arrangements on purchases from CDC and the substantial volume of purchases we made. In July 2008, we purchased the remaining 50percent of CDC as discussed in Note22 and we now own 100percent of the voting interest. As a result, variable interest entity accounting under GAAP no longer applies to this entity.
NOTE 24. OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME Other (expense) income included the following: Years ended December31, In millions 2009 2008 2007 Foreign currency (losses) gains $ (20 ) $ (46 ) $ 28 Bank charges (14 ) (12 ) (12 ) Change in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance(1) (4 ) (36 )  Dividend income 5 6 5 Other, net 18 18 12 Total other (expense) income, net $ (15 ) $ (70 ) $ 33 (1) The change in the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance was due to market deterioration, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, which included the write down of certain investments to zero.
136 Table of Contents CUMMINSINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 25. OPERATING SEGMENTS Operating segments under GAAP are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Cummins chief operating decision-maker (CODM) is the Chief Executive Officer.
Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Power Generation, Components and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. The engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as various industrial applications including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators and rents power equipment for both standby and prime power uses. The Components segment includes sales of filtration products, exhaust and aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets, and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various original equipment manufacturers.
We use segment EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, taxes and noncontrolling interests) as a primary basis for the CODM to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments. Segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments.
The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in the Consolidated Financial Statements . We prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We have allocated certain common costs and expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal and finance. We also do not allocate debt-related items, actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs or credits, restructuring and other charges, investment gains or losses, flood damage gains or losses or income taxes to individual segments. Segment EBIT may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.

(2) On January1, 2009, we adopted changes issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board to consolidation accounting and reporting. These changes, among others, require that minority interests be renamed noncontrolling interests and a company present a consolidated net income measure that includes the amount attributable to such noncontrolling interests for all periods presented.
(3) Earnings per share in each quarter is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during that quarter while earnings per share for the full year is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the year. Thus, the sum of the four quarters earnings per share does not equal the full year earnings per share.
At December31, 2009, there were approximately 3,850 holders of record of CumminsInc.'s $2.50 par value common stock.
