In Canada, we operated 34 restaurants, including 28 Red Lobster and six Olive Garden restaurants. Through subsidiaries, we own and operate all of our restaurants in the United States and Canada, except for three restaurants located in Central Florida that are owned by joint ventures we manage.

As of May29, 2011, we franchised five LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants in Puerto Rico to an unaffiliated franchisee, and 22 Red Lobster restaurants in Japan to an unaffiliated Japanese corporation, under area development and franchise agreements. We also have entered into an area development agreement with an unaffiliated operator to develop and operate Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants in the Middle East. As of May29, 2011, no restaurants had been opened under this agreement, but a Red Lobster opened in Dubai in July 2011.

The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with the information in our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations incorporated by reference in Item7 of this Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in Item8 of this Form 10-K.
Background We opened our first restaurant, a Red Lobster seafood restaurant, in Lakeland, Florida in 1968. Red Lobster was founded by William B. Darden, for whom we are named. Red Lobster has grown from six restaurants in operation at the end of fiscal 1970 to 698 restaurants in North America by the end of fiscal 2011. Olive Garden, an internally developed Italian restaurant brand, opened its first restaurant in Orlando, Florida in fiscal 1983, and by the end of fiscal 2011 had expanded to 754 restaurants in North America. The number of Red Lobster and Olive 1 Source: Nations Restaurant News, Special Report: Top 100,June27, 2011 (based on U.S. foodservice revenue from company-owned restaurants).
1 Table of Contents Garden restaurants open at the end of fiscal 2011 increased by four and 31, respectively, as compared to the end of fiscal 2010.
Bahama Breeze is an internally developed brand that provides a Caribbean escape, offering the food, drinks and atmosphere you would find in the islands. In fiscal 1996, Bahama Breeze opened its first restaurant in Orlando, Florida. At the end of fiscal 2011, there were 26 Bahama Breeze restaurants.
Seasons 52 is an internally developed brand that provides a casually sophisticated fresh grill and wine bar with seasonally inspired menus offering fresh ingredients to create great tasting meals that are lower in calories than comparable restaurant meals. Seasons 52 opened its first restaurant in Orlando, Florida in fiscal 2003. At the end of fiscal 2011, there were 17 Seasons 52 restaurants.
On October1, 2007, we completed the acquisition of the common stock of RARE Hospitality International, Inc. (RARE). RARE owned and operated two principal restaurant brands, LongHorn Steakhouse and The Capital Grille, of which 288 and 29 locations, respectively, were in operation as of the date of the acquisition. LongHorn Steakhouse, with locations primarily in the Eastern half of the United States, is a leader in the full service dining steakhouse category, and The Capital Grille, with locations in major metropolitan cities in the United States, is a leader in the premium steakhouse category. The acquired operations are included in our financial statements from the date of the acquisition. At the end of fiscal 2011, there were 354 LongHorn Steakhouse and 44 Capital Grille restaurants.
In March 2011, we opened a test synergy restaurant that houses both a Red Lobster and Olive Garden restaurant in the same building. At the end of fiscal 2011, this was the only synergy restaurant in operation.
The following table shows our growth and lists the number of restaurants operated by Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52 as of the end of each fiscal year since 1970, and the number of LongHorn Steakhouse and The Capital Grille restaurants operated by us as of the end of each fiscal year since fiscal 2008. The final column in the table lists our total sales for the years indicated.

Total company sales from 1970 through fiscal 1995 were included in the consolidated operations of our former parent company, General Mills, Inc., prior to our spin-off as a separate publicly traded corporation in May 1995.
(3) Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 605 requires sales incentives to be classified as a reduction of sales. For purposes of this presentation, sales incentives have been reclassified as a reduction of sales for fiscal 1998 through 2011. Sales incentives for fiscal years prior to 1998 have not been reclassified.
(4) Includes one test synergy restaurant housing two restaurant brands in the same building.
Strategy The restaurant industry is generally considered to be comprised of two segments: quick service and full service. The full service segment is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains. We believe that capable operators of strong multi-unit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the full service segment. We plan to grow by increasing the number of restaurants in each of our existing brands and by developing or acquiring additional brands that can be expanded profitably.
While we are a leader in the full service dining segment, we know we cannot be successful without a clear sense of who we are. Our core purpose is To nourish and delight everyone we serve. This core purpose is supported by our core values:  Integrity and fairness;  Respect and caring;  Diversity;  Always learning/always teaching;  Being of service;  Teamwork; and  Excellence.
3 Table of Contents Our mission is to be The best in full service dining, now and for generations. We believe we can achieve this goal by continuing to build on our strategy to be a brand-building company which is focused on:  Brand relevance;  Brand support;  A vibrant business model;  Competitively superior leadership; and  A unifying, motivating culture.

It offers an international wine list of more than 90 wines, with approximately 60 available by the glass.
Synergy Restaurant In March 2011, we opened a test synergy restaurant that houses both a Red Lobster and Olive Garden restaurant in the same building, but with separate front doors, dining rooms and brand-specific menus. The shared building is designed to keep the guest experience the same while delivering cost efficiencies. We developed this concept to test expansion into smaller markets that would not meet our population density requirements to build a single brand. Future synergy restaurants may not be limited to Red Lobster and Olive Garden combinations, but could involve our other brands as well.
Recent and Planned Growth During fiscal 2011, we opened 70 net new restaurants. Our actual and projected net new openings from continuing operations by brand are shown below.

Our objective is to continue to expand all of our restaurant brands, and to develop or acquire additional brands that can be expanded profitably. We continue to test new ideas and brands, and also to evaluate potential acquisition candidates to assess whether they would satisfy our strategic and financial objectives.
We consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurants long-term success, and we devote significant effort to the site selection process. Prior to entering a market, we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants. Our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors. These factors include trade area demographics, such as target population density and household income levels; competitive influences in the trade area; the sites visibility, accessibility and traffic volume; and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls, hotel/motel complexes, offices and universities. Members of senior management evaluate, inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition. Constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after permits are obtained and the site is acquired.
The following table illustrates the approximate average capital investment, size and dining capacity of the nine Red Lobster restaurants (seven new restaurants and two relocations), 34 Olive Garden restaurants (33 new restaurants and one relocation) and the 25 LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants (24 new restaurants and one relocation) opened during fiscal 2011.

We systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards. When a restaurant falls below minimum standards, we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes, and implement marketing and operational plans to improve that restaurants performance. If performance does not improve to acceptable levels, the restaurant is evaluated for relocation, closing or conversion to one of our other brands.
During fiscal 2009, we permanently closed three Red Lobster restaurants, one Olive Garden restaurant and five LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants. During fiscal 2010, we permanently closed three Red Lobster restaurants and three LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants. During fiscal 2011, we permanently closed one Red Lobster restaurant, two Olive Garden restaurants and two LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants. Permanent closures are typically due to 6 Table of Contents economic changes in trade areas, the expiration of lease agreements, or site selection concerns. Accordingly, we continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges.
Restaurant Operations We believe that high-quality restaurant management is critical to our long-term success. Our restaurant management structure varies by brand and restaurant size. We issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations, as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes. The restaurant management teams are responsible for the day-to-day operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards.
Each typical Red Lobster and Olive Garden restaurant is led by a general manager, and each LongHorn Steakhouse restaurant is led by a managing partner. Each also has three to five additional managers, depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant. In addition, each restaurant employs approximately 50-185 hourly employees, most of whom work part-time. Restaurant general managers or managing partners report to a director of operations who is responsible for approximately six to 10 restaurants. Restaurants are visited regularly by all levels of supervision to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards.
Each Bahama Breeze restaurant is led by a general manager, and each The Capital Grille and Seasons 52 restaurant is led by a managing partner. Each also has one to four assistant managers and one to three kitchen managers. In addition, each restaurant employs an average of approximately 70 to 115 hourly employees. The general manager or managing partner of each restaurant reports directly to a director of operations, who has operational responsibility for approximately three to ten restaurants. Restaurants are visited regularly by all levels of supervision to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards.
Our Learning Center of Excellence in partnership with each brands head of training, together with senior operations executives, are responsible for developing and maintaining our operations training programs. These efforts include a 12 to 15-week training program for management trainees and continuing development programs for managers, supervisors and directors. The emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant brand, but includes leadership, restaurant business management and culinary skills. We also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants, including deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations. The opening training teams typically begin work one week prior to opening and remain at the new restaurant for up to three weeks after the opening. They are re-deployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurants operating staff.
We maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our management-level employees. We believe that our leadership position, strong success-oriented culture and various short-term and long-term incentive programs, including stock and stock-based compensation, help attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers.
Quality Assurance Our Total Quality Department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe, high-quality food in a clean and safe environment. Through rigorous physical evaluation and testing at our North American laboratories and through point source inspection by our international team of Quality Specialists in several foreign countries, we purchase only seafood that meets or exceeds our specifications. We use independent third parties to inspect and evaluate commodity vendors. In addition, any commodity supplier that produces a high-risk product is subject to a food safety evaluation by Darden personnel at least annually. We require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) food safety programs adopted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The HACCP programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause food-borne illnesses by applying scientifically-based controls to analyze hazards, identify and monitor critical control points, and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met. Since 1976, we have required routine microbiological testing of seafood and other commodities for quality and microbiological safety. In addition, our total quality managers and third party auditors visit each restaurant periodically throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food 7 Table of Contents safety and sanitation. The total quality managers also serve as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety.
Purchasing and Distribution Our ability to ensure a consistent supply of high-quality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant brands depends on reliable sources of procurement. Our purchasing staff sources, negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 2,000 suppliers whose products originate in more than 30 countries. Suppliers must meet strict quality control standards in the development, harvest, catch and production of food products. Competitive bids, long-term contracts and long-term vendor relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products.
We believe that our seafood purchasing capabilities are a significant competitive advantage. Our purchasing staff travels routinely within the United States and internationally to source more than 100 varieties of top-quality seafood at competitive prices. We believe that we have established excellent long-term relationships with key seafood vendors and usually source our product directly from producers (not brokers or middlemen). While the supply of certain seafood species is volatile, we believe we have the ability to identify alternative seafood products and to adjust our menus as necessary. All other essential food products are available, or can be made available upon short notice, from alternative qualified suppliers. Because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products, inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales. Controlled inventories of specified products are distributed to restaurants through third-party national distribution companies. In addition, through agreements between our subsidiary Darden Direct Distribution, Inc. and these distribution companies, we maintain inventory ownership and dedicated operations in select environments enhancing our supply chains competitive advantage.
Our supplier diversity program is an integral part of our purchasing efforts. Through this program, we identify minority and women-owned vendors and assist them in establishing supplier relationships with us. We are committed to the development and growth of minority and women-owned enterprises, and during fiscal 2011 we spent approximately 5.8 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively, of our purchasing dollars with those firms.
We continue to invest in new technologies to improve our purchasing and restaurant operations. During fiscal 2011, we completed the implementation of iKitchen, a web-based software system, to our regional suppliers. The system is designed to more efficiently handle restaurant product orders, receiving, invoice approval and inventories.
Advertising and Marketing We believe we have developed significant marketing and advertising capabilities. Our size enables us to be a leading advertiser in the full service dining segment of the restaurant industry. Red Lobster and Olive Garden leverage the efficiency of national network television advertising. Olive Garden supplements this with cable, local television and digital advertising, and Red Lobster with cable and digital advertising. LongHorn Steakhouse currently uses local television advertising, and began national cable television advertising in fiscal 2011. The Capital Grille, Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52 do not use national television advertising. Our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to attract customers. We implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase our sales and profits, as well as strengthen our brands. We also rely on outdoor billboard, direct mail and email advertising, as well as radio, newspapers, digital coupons, search engine marketing and social media such as Facebook  and Twitter  , as appropriate, to attract and retain customers. We have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor customer satisfaction and evolving expectations.
8 Table of Contents Employees At the end of fiscal 2011, we employed approximately 178,500 persons. Of these employees, approximately 168,500 were hourly restaurant personnel. The remainder were restaurant management personnel located in the restaurants or in the field, or were located at our restaurant support center facility in Orlando, Florida. Our operating executives have an average of more than 14 years of experience with us. The restaurant general managers average 12 years with us. We believe that we provide working conditions and compensation that compare favorably with those of our competitors. Most employees, other than restaurant management and corporate management, are paid on an hourly basis. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.
In January 2011, we were ranked among Fortune magazines 100 Best Companies to Work For in America. We were the first full-service restaurant company ever to be named to the list, and are committed to fostering a strong, values-based culture where employees can learn, thrive and grow.
Information Technology We strive for leadership in the restaurant business by using technology as a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy. Since 1975, computers located in the restaurants have been used to assist in the management of the restaurants. We have implemented technology-enabled business solutions targeted at improved financial control, cost management, enhanced guest service and improved employee effectiveness. These solutions are designed to be used across restaurant brands, yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant brand. Our strategy is to fully integrate systems to drive operational efficiencies and enable restaurant teams to focus on restaurant operations excellence. Over the past few years, we implemented a new meal pacing system, in all Olive Garden and Red Lobster locations, designed to properly pace the preparation of menu items, based on cook-time, to enhance the guests experience and enhance restaurant capacity by increasing table turns. During fiscal 2012, Bahama Breeze, LongHorn Steakhouse, The Capital Grille and Seasons 52 will pilot and begin implementing this meal pacing system in their locations.
During fiscal 2011, Olive Garden implemented a new table management system to enhance the guest experience by providing accurate wait times and enhance restaurant capacity by increasing table turns. During fiscal 2012, LongHorn Steakhouse will pilot and begin implementing the table management system in its locations. In addition, during fiscal 2011 we continued to work on transformational initiatives to effectively manage our large work force and to manage our costs. During fiscal 2012, a talent acquisition system is being piloted and implemented across all brands for front line employee candidates.
Restaurant hardware and software support for all of our restaurant brands is provided or coordinated from the restaurant support center facility in Orlando, Florida, seven days a week, 24 hours a day. A high-speed data network sends and receives critical business data to and from the restaurants throughout the day and night, providing timely and extensive information on business activity in every location. Our data center contains sufficient computing power to process information from all restaurants quickly and efficiently. Our information is processed in a secure environment to protect both the actual data and the physical assets. We guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan, which includes storing critical business information off-site, testing the disaster recovery plan at a host-site facility and providing on-site power backup via a large diesel generator. We use internally developed proprietary software, as well as purchased software, with proven, non-proprietary hardware. This allows processing power to be distributed effectively to each of our restaurants.
Our management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates will position us well to support current needs and future growth. We are committed to maintaining an industry leadership position in information systems and computing technology. We use a strategic information systems planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning. Information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic, financial, regulatory and other business advantage criteria.
Competition The restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food, price, service, restaurant location, personnel, brand, attractiveness of facilities, and effectiveness of advertising and marketing. The 9 Table of Contents restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing restaurants; and consumers discretionary purchasing power. We compete within each market with national and regional chains and locally-owned restaurants for customers, management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites. We also face growing competition from the supermarket industry, which offers convenient meals in the form of improved entres and side dishes from the deli section. We expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas.
Other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled Purchasing and Distribution, Advertising and Marketing and Information Technology in this Item1 and in our Risk Factors in Item1A of this Form 10-K.
Trademarks, Service Marks, Franchises and Joint Ventures We regard our Darden Restaurants  , Red Lobster  , Olive Garden  , LongHorn Steakhouse  , The Capital Grille  , Bahama Breeze  , and Seasons 52  service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and as being important to our marketing efforts. Our policy is to pursue registration of our important service marks and trademarks and to oppose vigorously any infringement of them. Generally, with appropriate renewal and use, the registration of our service marks and trademarks will continue indefinitely.
All but three of our 1,894 restaurants in operation at May29, 2011 are Company-owned and operated. Those three restaurants are located in Central Florida and are owned by joint ventures managed by us. The joint ventures pay management fees to us, and we control the joint ventures use of our service marks. We have one unaffiliated franchisee with the right under an area development and franchise agreement to operate franchised LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants in Puerto Rico. As of May29, 2011, this franchisee operated five LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants in Puerto Rico. Our restaurant operations outside of North America are conducted through area development and franchise agreements. In Japan, we have an agreement with an unaffiliated Japanese corporation that operated 22 Red Lobster restaurants in Japan as of May29, 2011. In October 2010, we entered into a formal area development agreement with an unaffiliated operator to develop and operate Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants in the Middle East. The agreement calls for the operator to develop a minimum of 60 restaurants in Bahrain, Dubai, Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates over the next five years. As of May29, 2011, no restaurants had been opened under this agreement, but a Red Lobster opened in Dubai in July 2011. We do not have an ownership interest in these franchisees, but we receive royalty income under the franchise agreements. The amount of income we derive from these joint venture and franchise arrangements is not material to our consolidated financial statements.
Seasonality Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally. During fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, our average sales per restaurant were highest in the winter and spring, followed by the summer, and lowest in the fall. During fiscal 2009, our average sales per restaurant were highest in the summer and spring, followed by the winter, and lowest in the fall. Holidays, changes in the economy, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions.Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.
Government Regulation We are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business. Each of our restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. The development and operation of restaurants depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations. To date, we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals.
During fiscal 2011, 9.2 percent of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages. Regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site (in most cases, on an annual basis), and licenses may 10 Table of Contents be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. These regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant operation, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. The failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these licenses would adversely affect the restaurants operations. We also are subject in certain states to dram-shop statutes, which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person who then causes injury to himself or a third party. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance.
We also are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws governing such matters as overtime, tip credits, working conditions, safety standards, and hiring and employment practices. Changes in these laws during fiscal 2011 have not had a material effect on our operations.
We currently are operating under a Tip Rate Alternative Commitment (TRAC) agreement with the Internal Revenue Service. Through increased educational and other efforts in the restaurants, the TRAC agreement reduces the likelihood of potential chain-wide employer-only FICA assessments for unreported tips.
We are subject to federal and state environmental regulations, but these rules have not had a material effect on our operations. During fiscal 2011, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated.
Our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and related state accessibility statutes. Under the ADA and related state laws, we must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment, and when constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of our restaurants, we must make those facilities accessible.
We are reviewing the health care reform law enacted by Congress in March of 2010 (Health Care Reform Law).As part of that review, we will evaluate the potential impacts of this new law on our business, and accommodate various parts of the law as they take effect.
We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling. We are or may become subject to laws and regulations requiring disclosure of calorie, fat, trans fat, salt and allergen content. The Health Care Reform Law requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus. The Food and Drug Administration has proposed rules to implement this provision that would require restaurants to post the number of calories for most items on menus or menu boards and to make available more detailed nutrition information upon request.
We are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers, financial information (including credit card numbers), and health information.
See Item1A Risk Factors below for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state and local regulation of our business, including in the areas of health care reform, data privacy and environmental matters.

Item1A.
RISK FACTORS Various risks and uncertainties could affect our business. Any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. It is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. Therefore, the following is not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.
Food safety and food-borne illness concerns throughout the supply chain may have an adverse effect on our business.
Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our customers enjoy safe, quality food products. However, food safety issues could be caused by food suppliers or distributors and, as a result, be out of our control. In addition, regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses such as E. coli, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella, and other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination, at one of our restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our brands and have a negative impact on our sales. Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at 13 Table of Contents restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.
Litigation, including allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, guests, suppliers, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. These actions and proceedings may involve allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, including wage and hour violations and employment discrimination; guest discrimination; food safety issues including poor food quality, food-borne illness, food tampering, food contamination, and adverse health effects from consumption of various food products or high-calorie foods (including obesity); other personal injury; violation of dram shop laws (providing an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or a third party); trademark infringement; violation of the federal securities laws; or other concerns. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of our brands, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are found liable. Litigation could impact our operations in other ways as well. Allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, for example, could adversely affect employee acquisition and retention. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Unfavorable publicity, or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity, could harm our reputation and adversely impact our guest counts and sales.
The good reputation of our restaurant brands is a key factor in the success of our business. Actual or alleged incidents at any of our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could harm our brands. Even incidents occurring at restaurants operated by our competitors or in the supply chain generally could result in negative publicity that could harm the restaurant industry overall and, indirectly, our own brands. Negative publicity may result from allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, guest discrimination, illness, injury, or any of the other matters discussed above that could give rise to litigation. Regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid, unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants, or only to a single restaurant, could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand. Negative publicity also may result from health concerns including food safety and flu outbreaks, publication of government or industry findings concerning food products, environmental disasters, crime incidents, data privacy breaches, scandals involving our employees, or operational problems at our restaurants, all of which could make our brands and menu offerings less appealing to our guests and negatively impact our guest counts and sales. Adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of our brands, or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We are subject to a number of risks relating to federal, state and local regulation of our business, including in the areas of health care reform, environmental matters, minimum wage, data privacy, menu labeling, immigration requirements and taxes, and an insufficient or ineffective response to government regulation may impact our cost structure, operational efficiencies and talent availability.
The restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. The development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to building, zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements. We are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health, sanitation, safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages. We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling. We are subject to federal and state laws governing minimum wages, unionization and other labor issues. These include the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and requirements concerning overtime, family leave, tip credits, working conditions and safety standards. They also include the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which requires among other things the preparation of Form I-9 to verify that employees are authorized to accept employment in the United States.
14 Table of Contents We also are subject to federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings, and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation. New or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our cost of labor.
We are reviewing the Health Care Reform Law.As part of that review, we will evaluate the potential impacts of this new law on our business, and accommodate various parts of the law as they take effect.There are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can accommodate all of the costs associated with compliance.We did not receive tax-free subsidies for providing prescription drugs to retirees under Medicare Part D. Therefore, we have no deferred tax assets associated with our retiree medical plan that would be impacted by this law. The Health Care Reform Law also requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus. We do not expect to incur any material costs from compliance with this provision, but cannot anticipate any changes in guest behavior resulting from the implementation of this portion of the law, which could have an adverse effect on our sales or results of operations.
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials. There also has been increasing focus by U.S. and overseas governmental authorities on other environmental matters, such as climate change, the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption. This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters, such as the emission of greenhouse gases, where cap and trade initiatives could effectively impose a tax on carbon emissions. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities, which could decrease our operating profits and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment.
We are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers, financial information (including credit card numbers), and health information. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly, and any failure or perceived failure to comply with those laws could harm our reputation or lead to litigation, which could adversely affect our financial condition.
The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our cost structure, operational efficiencies and talent availability, and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.
We may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs.
Our restaurant operations are subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working conditions, overtime and tip credits. As federal and state minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage. Labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs. This in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales. Conversely, if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our profitability may decline. In addition, the current premiums that we pay for our insurance (including workers compensation, general liability, property, health, and directors and officers liability) may increase at any time, thereby further increasing our costs. The dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers compensation and general liability insurance, for which we carry high per-claim deductibles, may also increase at any time, thereby further increasing our costs. Further, the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses.
15 Table of Contents We rely heavily on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or breach of security of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.
We rely heavily on information systems across our operations, including for management of our supply chain, point-of-sale processing system in our restaurants, and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, a material network breach in the security of these systems as a result of a cyber attack, or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to us or an individual. This could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, or the improper use of personal information or other identity theft. Each of these situations or data privacy breaches may cause delays in customer service, reduce efficiency in our operations, require significant capital investments to remediate the problem, or result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation.
Our inability or failure to execute on a comprehensive business continuity plan following a major natural disaster such as a hurricane or manmade disaster, including terrorism, at our corporate facility could materially adversely impact our business.
Many of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one Florida location.
We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including hurricanes and other natural disasters, and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information.However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.
Health concerns arising from food-related pandemics, outbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business.
The United States and other countries have experienced, or may experience in the future, outbreaks of viruses, such as norovirus, avian flu or SARS, and H1N1 or swine flu, or other diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as mad cow disease. To the extent that a virus or disease is food-borne, or perceived to be food-borne, future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product, or could reduce public confidence in food handling and/or public assembly. For example, health concerns relating to the consumption of beef or to specific events such as an outbreak of mad cow disease may adversely impact sales at LongHorn Steakhouse and The Capital Grille restaurants that offer beef as a primary menu item. In addition, public concern over avian flu may cause fear about the consumption of chicken, eggs and other products derived from poultry. The inability to serve beef or poultry-based products would restrict our ability to provide a variety of menu items to our guests. If we change a restaurant menu in response to such concerns, we may lose customers who do not prefer the new menu, and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new customer base to produce the sales needed to make the restaurant profitable. We also may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of such a change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors. If a virus is transmitted by human contact, our employees or guests could become infected, or could choose, or be advised, to avoid gathering in public places, any of which could adversely affect our restaurant guest traffic, and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants, receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level. We also could be adversely affected if jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures, seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations. Even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business.
We face intense competition, and if we are unable to continue to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
The full service dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing, service, location, personnel and type and quality of food, and there are many well-established competitors. We 16 Table of Contents compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locally-owned restaurants. We also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services, particularly in the supermarket industry which offers convenient meals in the form of improved entres and side dishes from the deli section. We compete primarily on the quality, variety and value perception of menu items. The number and location of restaurants, type of brand, quality and efficiency of service, attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors. We anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors. If we are unable to continue to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
Our failure to drive sufficient profitable sales growth through brand relevance, operating excellence, opening new restaurants and developing or acquiring new dining brands could result in poor financial performance.
As part of our business strategy, we intend to drive profitable sales growth by increasing same-restaurant sales at existing restaurants, continuing to expand our current portfolio of restaurant brands, and developing or acquiring additional brands that can be expanded profitably. This strategy involves numerous risks, and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives. We may not be able to maintain brand relevance and restaurant operating excellence at existing brands to achieve sustainable same-restaurant sales growth and warrant new unit growth. A failure to define and deliver clear, relevant brands that generate sustainable same-restaurant traffic growth and produce non-traditional sales and earnings growth opportunities, or to evolve in-restaurant and brand support cost structures so that competitively strong sales growth results in stable and improving profit margins, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to support sustained new unit growth or open all of our planned new restaurants, and the new restaurants that we open may not be profitable or as profitable as our existing restaurants. New restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize, and even sales at successful newly-opened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation. The opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on sales levels at existing restaurants. Furthermore, we may not be able to develop or acquire additional brands that are as profitable as our existing restaurants. Growth through acquisitions may involve additional risks. For example, we may pay too much for a brand relative to the actual economic return, be required to borrow funds to make our acquisition (which would increase our interest expense) or be unable to successfully integrate an acquired brand into our operations.
The ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks, such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations, the need to obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals and liquor licenses) on a timely basis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors, the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets, the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay construction, increases in labor and building material costs, the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time, our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions. At each potential location, we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites, construction contractors, management personnel, hourly employees and other resources. If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated sales and earnings in future periods.
We incurred substantial additional indebtedness to finance the RARE acquisition, which may decrease our business flexibility and increase our borrowing costs.
We incurred substantial additional indebtedness to finance the RARE acquisition. Although our adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio has fallen to near pre-acquisition levels, it remains higher than it was before the acquisition. Our increased indebtedness and higher adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio, as compared to that which existed on a historical basis, may have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs.
Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it may: 17 Table of Contents  require a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness and reduce our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate requirements;  limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, additional acquisitions or general corporate requirements, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and  limit our flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions as compared to our competitors.
There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity. A default under our debt instruments may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing.
Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control.
Our plans to expand our newer brands Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52 and the testing of synergy restaurants that have not yet proven their long-term viability may not be successful, which could require us to make substantial further investments in those brands and test formats and result in losses and impairments.
While each of our restaurant brands, as well as each of our individual restaurants, are subject to the risks and uncertainties described above, there is an enhanced level of risk and uncertainty related to the operation and expansion of our newer brands such as Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52 and the testing of new restaurant formats such as synergy restaurants. These brands and test formats have not yet proven their long-term viability or growth potential. We have made substantial investments in the development and expansion of each of these brands and test formats, and further investment is required. While we have implemented a number of changes to operations at Bahama Breeze, and believe we have improved the guest experience and unit economics sufficiently to restart modest unit growth, there can be no assurance that these changes will continue to be successful or that additional new unit growth will occur. Seasons 52 also is in the early stages of its development and will require additional resources to support further growth. There likewise can be no assurances that the testing of the synergy restaurant format will prove successful. In each case, these brands and formats will continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties that accompany any emerging restaurant brand or format.
A lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our sales and results of operations.
The success of our restaurants depends in large part on their locations. As demographic and economic patterns change, current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable. Possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations. In addition, desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation. The occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
We may experience higher-than-anticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing, relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
Our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing, relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants. We incur substantial pre-opening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close, relocate or remodel existing restaurants. The expenses of opening, closing, relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated. An increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
18 Table of Contents Increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our results of operations.
If our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions, if our advertising, media or marketing expenses increase, or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Inadequate or ineffective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales.
A failure to develop and recruit effective leaders, the loss of key personnel or a significant shortage of high-quality restaurant employees could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets.
Our future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other employees. Our future growth also depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain high-quality employees to work in and manage our restaurants. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and other employees in order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth. A failure to maintain appropriate organizational capacity and capability to support leadership excellence and build adequate bench strength required for growth, a loss of key employees or a significant shortage of high-quality restaurant employees could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets.
The price and availability of key food products, ingredients and utilities used by our restaurants and a failure to achieve economies of scale in purchasing could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.
Our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food, ingredients, utilities and other related costs over which we may have little control. Operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities, including shrimp, lobster, crab and other seafood, as well as beef, pork, chicken, cheese and produce. The introduction of or changes to tariffs on imported shrimp or other food products could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products. We attempt to leverage our size to achieve economies of scale in purchasing, but there can be no assurances that we can always do so effectively. We are subject to the general risks of inflation. Our restaurants operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as electricity and natural gas, whether as a result of inflation or otherwise, on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply. In addition, interruptions to the availability of gas, electric, water or other utilities, whether due to aging infrastructure, weather conditions, fire, animal damage, trees, digging accidents or other reasons largely out of our control, may adversely affect our operations. Some climatologists predict that the long-term effects of climate change may result in more severe, volatile weather. Our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
We may lose sales or incur increased costs if our restaurants experience shortages or interruptions in the delivery of food and other products from our third party vendors and suppliers.
Possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants caused by inclement weather, natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes, the inability of our vendors to obtain credit in a tightened credit market or remain solvent given disruptions in the financial markets, or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. We may have a limited number of suppliers for certain of our products. Supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our restaurant operations. If we temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular items from a restaurants menu, that restaurant may experience a significant reduction in sales during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our customers changing their dining habits.
Volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to hedge exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings.
We use or may use derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs, including but not limited to coffee, butter, wheat, soybean oil, pork, beef, diesel fuel, gasoline and natural gas. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently, resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported as a component of cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings included in our consolidated financial statements. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments.
19 Table of Contents Certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and other general macroeconomic factors including unemployment, energy prices and interest rates that are largely out of our control may adversely affect consumer behavior and our results of operations.
Our business results depend on a number of industry-specific and general economic factors, many of which are beyond our control. The full service dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in national, regional and local economic conditions, seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes, consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences, including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits, and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant brands. The performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends, severe weather including hurricanes, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants.
General economic conditions may also adversely affect our results of operations. Recessionary economic cycles, a protracted economic slowdown, a worsening economy, increased unemployment, increased energy prices, rising interest rates or other industry-wide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings. Job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies and falling home prices could cause customers to make fewer discretionary purchases, and any significant decrease in our customer traffic or average profit per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance. In addition, if gasoline, natural gas, electricity and other energy costs increase, and credit card, home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates, our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine out, may spend less on each dining out occasion, or may choose more inexpensive restaurants.
Furthermore, we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, heightened security requirements, or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure, such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems, could have on our operations, the economy or consumer confidence generally. Any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures.
Unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our customers could increase our costs, reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing, any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Disruptions in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact consumer spending patterns, affect the availability and cost of credit and increase pension plan expenses.
Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Global credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil recently, characterized by the bankruptcy, failure or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States and other governments. These events may adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged, and the availability and cost of credit in the future. There can be no assurances that we will be able to arrange credit on terms we believe are acceptable or that permit us to finance our business with historical margins. The lack of credit, along with the macroeconomic factors previously discussed, may have an adverse impact on certain of our suppliers, landlords and other tenants in retail centers in which we are located. If these issues continue or worsen, they could further materially impact these parties, which in turn could negatively affect our financial results. Any new or continuing disruptions in the financial markets may also adversely affect the U.S. and world economy, which could negatively impact consumer spending patterns. There can be no assurances as to how or when this period of turmoil will be resolved. Changes in the capital markets could also have significant effects on our pension plan. Our pension income or expense is affected by factors including the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for the pension plans for some of our employees, the weighted average asset allocation and long-term rate of return of our pension plan assets, the discount rate used to determine the service and interest cost components of our net periodic pension cost and assumed rates of increase in our employees future compensation. If our pension plan assets do not achieve positive rates of return, or if our estimates 20 Table of Contents and assumed rates are not accurate, our earnings may decrease because net periodic pension costs would rise and we could be required to provide additional funds to cover our obligations to employees under the pension plan.
We face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees, business partners and vendors in foreign markets.
Our expansion into international markets could create risks to our brands and reputation. We believe that we have selected high-caliber international operating partners and franchisees with significant experience in restaurant operations, and provide them with training and support. However, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee. If the franchisee does not successfully operate its restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards, or customers have negative experiences due to issues with food quality or operational execution, our brand values could suffer, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
There also is no assurance that international operations will be profitable or that international growth will continue. Our international operations are subject to all of the same risks associated with our domestic operations, as well as a number of additional risks. These include, among other things, international economic and political conditions, foreign currency fluctuations, and differing cultures and consumer preferences.
We also are subject to governmental regulations throughout the world that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs regulations and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business.
We regard our Darden Restaurants  , Red Lobster  , Olive Garden  , LongHorn Steakhouse  , The Capital Grille  , Bahama Breeze  , and Seasons 52  service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and other common law rights, such as trade secret and unfair competition laws, to protect our restaurants and services from infringement. We have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. However, we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other persons. Although our policy is to oppose any such infringement, further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant. Although we believe have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate, and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources.
Impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired. We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We compare the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit. If the carrying value is less than the fair value, no impairment exists. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication of impairment. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment exists. Factors may include, among others: a significant decline in our expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates. Any adverse change in these factors would have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. We compute the amount of impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. We are required to record a non-cash impairment charge if the testing performed indicates that goodwill has been impaired.
21 Table of Contents We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, primarily the LongHorn Steakhouse  and The Capital Grille  trademarks, to determine if they are definite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.
As with goodwill, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks) for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. We estimate the fair value of the trademarks based on an income valuation model using the relief from royalty method, which requires assumptions related to projected sales from our annual long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademarks and a discount rate.
We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
Failure of our internal controls over financial reporting and future changes in accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results, affect our reported results of operations or otherwise harm our business and financial results.
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. Our growth and acquisition of other restaurant companies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. A significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock.
A change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions before the change is effective. New pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing accounting rules or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our reported financial results. Additionally, our assumptions, estimates and judgments related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including but not limited to, revenue recognition, fair value of investments, impairment of long-lived assets, leases and related economic transactions, derivatives, pension and post-retirement benefits, intangibles, self-insurance, income taxes, property and equipment, unclaimed property laws and litigation, and stock-based compensation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by us. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance.

PROPERTIES Restaurant Properties  Continuing Operations As of May29, 2011, we operated 1,894 restaurants (consisting of 698 Red Lobster, 754 Olive Garden, 354 LongHorn Steakhouse, 44 The Capital Grille, 26 Bahama Breeze, 17 Seasons 52 and one Synergy), in the following locations: Alabama (40) Indiana (51) Nebraska (8) South Carolina (38) Arkansas (17) Iowa (18) Nevada (14) South Dakota (4) Arizona (44) Kansas (20) New Hampshire (10) Tennessee (52) California (106) Kentucky (25) New Jersey (55) Texas (148) Colorado (31) Louisiana (19) New Mexico (13) Utah (17) Connecticut (17) Maine (9) New York (59) Vermont (2) Delaware (7) Maryland (40) North Carolina (56) Virginia (59) District of Columbia (1) Massachusetts (33) North Dakota (5) Washington (31) Florida (207) Michigan (58) Ohio (101) West Virginia (11) Georgia (115) Minnesota (25) Oklahoma (21) Wisconsin (23) Hawaii (1) Mississippi (15) Oregon (14) Wyoming (3) Idaho (8) Missouri (47) Pennsylvania (92) Canada (34) Illinois (65) Montana (2) Rhode Island (3) Of these 1,894 restaurants open on May29, 2011, 973 were located on owned sites and 921 were located on leased sites. The 921 leases are classified as follows: Land-Only Leases (we own buildings and equipment) 726 Ground and Building Leases 73 Space/In-Line/Other Leases 122 Total 921 Properties  General During fiscal 1999, we formed two subsidiary corporations, each of which elected to be taxed as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. These elections limit the activities of both corporations to holding certain real estate assets. The formation of these two REITs is designed primarily to assist us in managing our real estate portfolio and possibly to provide a vehicle to access capital markets in the future.
Both REITs are non-public REITs. Through our subsidiary companies, we indirectly own 100 percent of all voting stock and greater than 99.5 percent of the total value of each REIT. For financial reporting purposes, both REITs are included in our consolidated financial statements.
On June20, 2006, we entered into an agreement to sell and lease back the 10 buildings that we previously owned which comprised the majority of our Restaurant Support Center. These buildings included our executive offices, culinary center, training facilities and supporting warehouses in Orange County (Orlando metro area), Florida. The sale and the commencement of our leases for those buildings occurred in August 2006. The leases for those buildings terminated in late December 2009.
In connection with the sale and lease back of our former Restaurant Support Center buildings, we purchased several adjacent parcels of vacant land in Orange County, Florida, and relocated our headquarters to this site during the second quarter of fiscal 2010. The site includes a main headquarters building, data center and parking deck. The Restaurant Support Center campus at this new location offers a more collaborative and unified environment with additional room for future growth.
As part of the acquisition of RARE, we acquired ownership of the former RARE executive offices and central training facility located in six office buildings in Atlanta, Georgia. As of May29, 2011, we have sold four of those buildings, and the remaining buildings continue to be marketed for sale.
23 Table of Contents Except in limited instances, our present restaurant sites and other facilities are not subject to mortgages or encumbrances securing money borrowed by us from outside sources. In our opinion, our current buildings and equipment generally are in good condition, suitable for their purposes and adequate for our current needs. See also Note 5 Land, Buildings and Equipment, Net and Note 14 Leases under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2011 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated herein by reference.
