BUSINESS Introduction Darden Restaurants, Inc. is the worlds largest company-owned and operated full service restaurant company 1 , and served over 404million meals in fiscal 2009. As of May31, 2009, we operated through subsidiaries 1,773 restaurants in the United States and Canada. In the United States, we operated 1,738 restaurants in 49 states (the exception being Alaska), including 661 Red Lobster  , 685 Olive Garden  , 321 LongHorn Steakhouse  , 37 The Capital Grille  , 24 Bahama Breeze  , eight Seasons 52  , and two specialty restaurants: Hemenways Seafood Grille& Oyster Bar  and The Old Grist Mill Tavern  . In Canada, we operated 35 restaurants, including 29 Red Lobster and six Olive Garden restaurants. Through subsidiaries, we own and operate all of our restaurants in the United States and Canada, except three. Those three restaurants are located in Central Florida and are owned by joint ventures managed by us. The joint ventures pay management fees to us, and we control the joint ventures use of our service marks. None of our restaurants in the U.S. or Canada are franchised. Of our 1,773 restaurants open on May31, 2009, 926 were located on owned sites and 847 were located on leased sites. As of May31, 2009, we franchised five LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants in Puerto Rico to an unaffiliated franchisee, and 25 Red Lobster restaurants in Japan to an unaffiliated Japanese corporation, under area development and franchise agreements.
Darden Restaurants, Inc. is a Florida corporation incorporated in March 1995, and is the parent company of GMRI, Inc., also a Florida corporation. GMRI, Inc. and certain other of our subsidiaries own and operate our restaurants. GMRI, Inc. was originally incorporated in March 1968 as Red Lobster Inns of America, Inc. We were acquired by General Mills, Inc. in 1970 and became a separate publicly held company in 1995 when General Mills distributed all of our outstanding stock to the stockholders of General Mills. Our principal executive offices and restaurant support center are located at 5900 Lake Ellenor Drive, Orlando, Florida 32809, telephone (407)245-4000. We anticipate moving to a new restaurant support center, also in Orlando, Florida, during the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Our corporate website address is www.darden.com .

Information on our website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to Darden, we, our or us include Darden Restaurants, Inc., GMRI, Inc. and our respective subsidiaries.
We have a 52/53 week fiscal year ending the last Sunday in May. Our 2009 fiscal year ended May31, 2009, had 53 weeks, and our 2008 fiscal year ended May25, 2008, and our 2007 fiscal year ended May27, 2007, each had 52 weeks.
The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with the information in our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations incorporated by reference in Item7 of this Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in Item8 of this Form 10-K.
Background We opened our first restaurant, a Red Lobster seafood restaurant, in Lakeland, Florida in 1968. Red Lobster was founded by William B. Darden, for whom we are named. We were acquired by General Mills, Inc. in 1970. In May 1995, we became a separate publicly held company when General Mills distributed all outstanding Darden stock to General Mills stockholders.

1 Table of Contents Red Lobster has grown from six restaurants in operation at the end of fiscal 1970 to 690 restaurants in North America by the end of fiscal 2009. Olive Garden, an internally developed Italian restaurant concept, opened its first restaurant in Orlando, Florida in fiscal 1983, and by the end of fiscal 2009 had expanded to 691 restaurants in North America. The number of Red Lobster and Olive Garden restaurants open at the end of fiscal 2009 increased by ten and 38, respectively, as compared to the end of fiscal 2008.
Bahama Breeze is an internally developed concept that provides a Caribbean escape, offering the food, drinks and atmosphere you would find in the islands. In fiscal 1996, Bahama Breeze opened its first restaurant in Orlando, Florida. At the end of fiscal 2009, there were 24 Bahama Breeze restaurants.
Seasons 52 is an internally developed concept that provides a casually sophisticated fresh grill and wine bar with seasonally inspired menus offering fresh ingredients to create great tasting meals that are lower in calories than comparable restaurant meals. Seasons 52 opened its first restaurant in Orlando, Florida in fiscal 2003. At the end of fiscal 2009, there were eight Seasons 52 restaurants.
On August16, 2007, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to purchase the common stock of RARE Hospitality International, Inc. (RARE) through a tender offer for $38.15 per share in cash, to be followed by a merger in which the remaining RARE shareholders would each receive $38.15 per share in cash, or approximately $1.27 billion in total purchase price. In addition, as a result of the acquisition, we repaid RAREs 2.5 percent convertible notes for approximately $134.8 million, including $9.8 million related to a conversion premium. RARE owned and operated two principal restaurant concepts, LongHorn Steakhouse and The Capital Grille, of which 288 and 29 locations, respectively, were in operation as of the date of the acquisition, which was completed on October1, 2007. LongHorn Steakhouse, with locations primarily in the Eastern half of the United States, is a leader in the full service dining steakhouse category, and The Capital Grille, with locations in major metropolitan cities in the United States, is a leader in the premium steakhouse category. RARE also had two specialty restaurants, Hemenways Seafood Grille& Oyster Bar and The Old Grist Mill Tavern that were acquired in the merger. The acquired operations are included in our financial statements from the date of the acquisition.
The following table shows our growth and lists the number of restaurants operated by Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52 as of the end of each fiscal year since 1970, and the number of LongHorn Steakhouse and The Capital Grille restaurants operated by us as of the end of each fiscal year since fiscal 2008. The final column in the table lists our total sales for the years indicated.

(2) From fiscal 1996 forward, includes only net sales from continuing operations and excludes sales related to all restaurants that were closed and considered discontinued operations. Periods prior to fiscal 1996 include total sales from all of our operations, including sales from restaurant concepts besides Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52 that are no longer owned or operated by us. Total company sales from 1970 through fiscal 1995 were included in the consolidated operations of our former parent company, General Mills, Inc., prior to our spin-off as a separate publicly traded corporation in May 1995.
(3) Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00-14 Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives (Issue 00-14) requires sales incentives to be classified as a reduction of sales. We adopted Issue 00-14 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. For purposes of this presentation, sales incentives have been reclassified as a reduction of sales for fiscal 1998 through 2009. Sales incentives for fiscal years prior to 1998 have not been reclassified.
(4) Includes two specialty restaurants: Hemenways Seafood Grille& Oyster Bar and The Old Grist Mill Tavern.
Strategy The restaurant industry is generally considered to be comprised of two segments: quick service and full service. The full service segment is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains. We believe that capable operators of strong multi-unit concepts have the opportunity to increase their share of the full service segment. We plan to grow by increasing the number of restaurants in each of our existing concepts and by developing or acquiring additional concepts that can be expanded profitably.
While we are a leader in the full service dining segment, we know we cannot be successful without a clear sense of who we are. Our core purpose is To nourish and delight everyone we serve. This core purpose is supported by our core values:  Integrity and fairness;  Respect and caring;  Diversity;  Always learning/always teaching;  Being of service;  Teamwork; and  Excellence.
3 Table of Contents Our mission is to be The best in full service dining, now and for generations. We believe we can achieve this goal by continuing to build on our strategy to be a brand-building company which is focused on:  Brand relevance;  Brand support;  A vibrant business model;  Competitively superior leadership; and  A unifying, motivating culture.
Restaurant Concepts Red Lobster Red Lobster is the largest full service dining, seafood specialty restaurant operator in the United States. It offers an extensive menu featuring fresh fish, shrimp, crab, lobster, scallops and other seafood in a casual atmosphere.

Most lunch menu entre prices range from $6.99 to $ 12.99. The price of most entres includes salad, side items and as many of our signature Cheddar Bay biscuits as a guest desires. During fiscal 2009, the average check per person was approximately $19.00 to $19.50, with alcoholic beverages accounting for 7.4 percent of Red Lobsters sales. Red Lobster maintains different lunch and dinner menus across its trade areas to reflect geographic differences in consumer preferences, prices and selections, as well as a lower-priced childrens menu.
Olive Garden Olive Garden is the largest full service dining Italian restaurant operator in the United States. Olive Gardens menu includes a variety of authentic Italian foods featuring fresh ingredients and a wine list that includes a broad selection of wines imported from Italy. The menu includes antipasti (appetizers); soups, salad and garlic breadsticks; baked pastas; sauted specialties with chicken, seafood and fresh vegetables; grilled meats; and a variety of desserts. Olive Garden also uses coffee imported from Italy for its espresso and cappuccino.
Most dinner menu entre prices range from $8.95 to $22.95, and most lunch menu entre prices range from $6.95 to $15.95. The price of each entre also includes as much fresh salad or soup and breadsticks as a guest desires. For fiscal 2009, the average check per person was approximately $15.50 to $16.00, with alcoholic beverages accounting for 7.7 percent of Olive Gardens sales. Olive Garden maintains different menus for dinner and lunch and different menus across its trade areas to reflect geographic difference in consumer preferences, prices and selections, as well as a lower-priced childrens menu.
LongHorn Steakhouse Acquired by Darden in October 2007 as part of the RARE acquisition, LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants are full service establishments serving both lunch and dinner in an attractive and inviting atmosphere reminiscent of the classic American West. With locations in 29 states, primarily in the Eastern half of the United States, LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants feature a variety of top quality menu items including signature fresh steaks, as well as salmon, shrimp, chicken, ribs, pork chops, burgers and prime rib.
Most dinner menu entre prices range from $12.00 to $22.00, and most lunch menu entre prices range from $7.00 to $12.00. The price of each entre also includes as much freshly baked bread as a guest desires. During fiscal 2009, the average check per person was approximately $17.50 to $18.00, with alcoholic beverages accounting for 9.6 percent of LongHorn Steakhouses sales. LongHorn Steakhouse maintains different menus for dinner and lunch and different menus across its trade areas to reflect geographic differences in consumer preferences, prices and selections, as well as a lower-priced childrens menu.
4 Table of Contents The Capital Grille Acquired by Darden in October 2007 as part of the RARE acquisition, The Capital Grille has locations in major metropolitan cities in the United States and features relaxed elegance and style. Nationally acclaimed for dry aging steaks on the premises, The Capital Grille is also known for fresh seafood flown in daily and culinary specials created by its chefs.

The Capital Grille maintains different menus for dinner and lunch and different menus across its trade areas to reflect geographic differences in consumer preferences, prices and selections.
Bahama Breeze Bahama Breeze restaurants bring guests the feeling of a Caribbean escape, offering the food, drinks and atmosphere found in the islands. The menu features distinctive, Caribbean-inspired fresh seafood, chicken and steaks as well as signature specialty drinks. The first Bahama Breeze opened in 1996 and met with strong positive consumer response. We continued to test the concept by opening a limited number of additional restaurants in each of the following years, and began national expansion of the concept in 1998. The concept was well received by guests, but due to weaker-than-expected financial performance, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 Bahama Breeze closed six restaurants and wrote down the carrying value of four others. This action reduced the total number of restaurants in operation to 32, and all new restaurant expansion was postponed.
Since fiscal 2004, Bahama Breeze has implemented changes to become a more relevant brand for its guests, evolve its menu to make it more approachable yet still distinctive and improve the guest experience while lowering its operating costs. In fiscal 2007, Bahama Breeze wrote down the carrying value of five restaurants and closed nine but improved the guest experience and unit economics sufficiently at the remaining restaurants that we have restarted modest unit growth, with one restaurant opened in fiscal 2009, in Wayne, New Jersey, and one projected new restaurant opening in Jacksonville, Florida, in fiscal 2010. The results of operations of the nine closed restaurants are reported as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Most dinner menu entre prices at Bahama Breeze range from $9.00 to $23.00, and most lunch entre prices range from $9.00 to $14.00. During fiscal 2009, the average check per person was approximately $23.00 to $23.50, with alcoholic beverages accounting for 23.1 percent of Bahama Breezes sales. Bahama Breeze maintains different menus for dinner and lunch and different menus across its trade areas to reflect geographic differences in consumer preferences, prices and selections, as well as a lower-priced childrens menu.
Seasons 52 Seasons 52 is a casually sophisticated, fresh grill and wine bar with seasonally inspired menus offering fresh ingredients to create great tasting meals that are lower in calories than comparable restaurant meals. It offers an international wine list of more than 90 wines, with 64 available by the glass. Seasons 52 first opened in 2003, and currently operates eight existing restaurants with plans to open two to three new restaurants in fiscal 2010.
Discontinued Operations In fiscal 2007, we announced the closure of 54 Smokey Bones Barbeque& Grill restaurants and two Rocky River Grillhouse restaurants, and subsequently sold the remaining 73 operating Smokey Bones restaurants during fiscal 2008. Also in fiscal 2007, we closed nine Bahama Breeze restaurants. The results of operations for these restaurants are treated as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
5 Table of Contents Recent and Planned Growth On a continuing operations basis, during fiscal 2009, we opened 71 net new restaurants. Our actual and projected net new openings from continuing operations by concept are shown below.
Actual Net New RestaurantOpenings Fiscal 2009 Projected Net New RestaurantOpenings Fiscal 2010 Red Lobster 10 3-5 Olive Garden 38 30-32 LongHorn Steakhouse 16 10-12 The Capital Grille 5 3 Bahama Breeze 1 1 Seasons 52 1 2-3 Totals 71 Approximately50-55 The actual number of openings for each of our concepts will depend on many factors, including our ability to locate appropriate sites, negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms, obtain necessary local governmental permits, complete construction, and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel. Our objective is to continue to expand all of our restaurant concepts, and to develop or acquire additional concepts that can be expanded profitably. We have continued to test new ideas and concepts, and also to evaluate potential acquisition candidates to assess whether they would satisfy our strategic and financial objectives.
We consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurants long-term success, and we devote significant effort to the site selection process. Prior to entering a market, we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants. Our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors. These factors include trade area demographics, such as target population density and household income levels; competitive influences in the trade area; the sites visibility, accessibility and traffic volume; and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls, hotel/motel complexes, offices and universities. Members of senior management evaluate, inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition. Constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after permits are obtained and the site is acquired.
The following table illustrates the approximate average capital investment, size and dining capacity of the 15 Red Lobster restaurants (12 new restaurants and three relocations), 41 Olive Garden restaurants (38 new restaurants and three relocations) and the 21 LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants (all new and no relocations) opened during fiscal 2009. The table excludes any rebuilt restaurants.

(2) Includes all space under the roof, including the coolers and freezers.

We systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards. When a restaurant falls below minimum standards, we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes, and implement marketing and operational plans to improve that restaurants performance. If performance does not improve to acceptable levels, the restaurant is evaluated for relocation, closing or conversion to one of our other concepts.
6 Table of Contents As discussed above under Discontinued Operations, we sold or closed a number of restaurants during fiscal 2007 and 2008. While not included in discontinued operations, in fiscal 2008, we permanently closed three Red Lobster restaurants, one Olive Garden restaurant and, following the acquisition of RARE on October1, 2007, one LongHorn Steakhouse restaurant. During fiscal 2009, we permanently closed three Red Lobster restaurants, one Olive Garden restaurant, five LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants, and no The Capital Grille, Bahama Breeze or Seasons 52 restaurants. We continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges.
Restaurant Operations We believe that high-quality restaurant management is critical to our long-term success. Our restaurant management structure varies by concept and restaurant size. We issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations, as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes. The restaurant management teams are responsible for the day-to-day operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards.
Each typical Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52 restaurant is led by a general manager and three to five additional managers, depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant. Each restaurant also employs approximately 50-185 hourly employees, most of who work part-time. Restaurant general managers report to multi unit supervisors who are Directors of Operations or Regional Directors. At the end of fiscal 2009, each multi unit supervisor was responsible for approximately six to 10 restaurants. Restaurants are visited regularly by all levels of supervision to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards.
The management staff of a typical LongHorn Steakhouse and The Capital Grille restaurant consists of one managing partner, one to four assistant managers and one or two kitchen managers. In addition, each of these restaurants employs approximately 40 to 80 hourly employees. The managing partner of each restaurant reports directly to a multi unit supervisor who may be a Director of Operations or Regional Director.Multi unit supervisors have operational responsibility for approximately three to nine restaurants. Regional Directors at The Capital Grille also have responsibility for The Old Grist Mill Tavern and Hemenways Seafood Grille& Oyster Bar restaurants. Restaurants are visited regularly by all levels of supervision to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards.
Each concepts head of training, together with senior operations executives, are responsible for developing and maintaining that concepts operations training programs. These efforts include a 12 to 15-week training program for management trainees and continuing development programs for managers, supervisors and directors. The emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant concept, but includes leadership, restaurant business management and culinary skills. We also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants, including deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations. The opening training teams typically begin work one week prior to opening and remain at the new restaurant for up to three weeks after the opening. They are re-deployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurants operating staff.
We maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our management-level employees. We believe that our leadership position, strong success-oriented culture and various short-term and long-term incentive programs, including stock units, help attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers. With the acquisition of RARE, we also have continued a managing partner program in which qualifying general managers of LongHorn Steakhouse and The Capital Grille restaurants receive cash compensation and restricted stock awards based upon individual performance.
Quality Assurance Our Total Quality Department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe, high-quality food in a clean and safe environment. Through rigorous physical evaluation and testing at our North American laboratories and through point source inspection by our international team of Quality Specialists in several foreign countries, we purchase only seafood that meets or exceeds our specifications. We use independent third parties to inspect and evaluate commodity vendors. In addition, any commodity supplier that produces a high risk product is subject to a food safety evaluation by Darden personnel at least annually. We require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) food safety 7 Table of Contents programs adopted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The HACCP programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause food-borne illnesses by applying scientifically-based controls to analyze hazards, identify and monitor critical control points, and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met. Since 1976, we have required routine microbiological testing of seafood and other commodities for quality and microbiological safety. In addition, our total quality managers and third party auditors visit each restaurant periodically throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation. The total quality managers also serve as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety. This HACCP program has now been expanded to include both LongHorn Steakhouse and The Capital Grille operations as part of the integration of RARE.
Purchasing and Distribution Our ability to ensure a consistent supply of high-quality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant concepts depends on reliable sources of procurement. Our purchasing staff sources, negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 2,000 suppliers in more than 30 countries. Suppliers must meet strict quality control standards in the development, harvest, catch and production of food products. Competitive bids, long-term contracts and long-term vendor relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products.
We believe that our seafood purchasing capabilities are a significant competitive advantage. Our purchasing staff travels routinely within the United States and internationally to source more than 100 varieties of top-quality seafood at competitive prices. We believe that we have established excellent long-term relationships with key seafood vendors and usually source our product directly from producers (not brokers or middlemen). We operate procurement offices in Yantai, China and Toronto, Canada, our only purchasing offices outside of Orlando, Florida, to source products directly from Asia and Canada. While the supply of certain seafood species is volatile, we believe we have the ability to identify alternative seafood products and to adjust our menus as necessary. All other essential food products are available, or can be made available upon short notice, from alternative qualified suppliers. Because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products, inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales. Controlled inventories of specified products are distributed to restaurants through independent national distribution companies. In addition, through strategic alliances between our subsidiary Darden Direct Distribution, Inc. and these distribution companies, we maintain inventory ownership and dedicated operations in select environments enhancing our supply chains competitive advantage.
Our supplier diversity program is an integral part of our purchasing efforts. Through this program, we identify minority and women-owned vendors and assist them in establishing supplier relationships with us. We are committed to the development and growth of minority and women-owned enterprises, and in fiscal 2009 we spent approximately 8.0 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively, of our purchasing dollars with those firms.
We continue to invest in new technologies to improve our purchasing and restaurant operations. We are in the process of expanding iKitchen, a web-based software system, to our regional suppliers. The system is designed to more efficiently handle restaurant product orders, receiving, invoice approval and inventories.
Advertising and Marketing We believe we have developed significant marketing and advertising capabilities. Our size enables us to be a leading advertiser in the full service dining segment of the restaurant industry. Red Lobster and Olive Garden leverage the efficiency of national network television advertising and supplement it with local television advertising. LongHorn Steakhouse, The Capital Grille, Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52 do not use national television advertising. Our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to attract customers. We implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase our sales and profits. We also rely on outdoor billboard and direct mail advertising, as well as radio, newspaper and direct mail coupon programs, as appropriate, to attract customers. We have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor customer satisfaction and evolving expectations.
8 Table of Contents Employees At the end of fiscal 2009, we employed approximately 179,000 persons. Of these employees, approximately 1,400 were corporate or restaurant concept personnel located in our restaurant support center in Orlando, Florida, approximately 7,800 were restaurant management personnel in the restaurants or in field offices and the remainder were hourly restaurant personnel. Of the corporate and restaurant concept personnel located at our restaurant support center in Orlando, approximately 62 percent were management personnel and the balance were administrative or office employees. Our operating executives have an average of more than 14 years of experience with us. The restaurant general managers average 12 years with us. We believe that we provide working conditions and compensation that compare favorably with those of our competitors. Most employees, other than restaurant management and corporate management, are paid on an hourly basis. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Information Technology We strive for leadership in the restaurant business by using technology as a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy. Since 1975, computers located in the restaurants have been used to assist in the management of the restaurants. We have implemented systems targeted at improved financial control, cost management, enhanced guest service and improved employee effectiveness. Management information systems are designed to be used across restaurant concepts, yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant concepts. These management information systems include a suite of web-enabled and fully integrated financial and human resource (including payroll and benefits) systems and a high-speed data network connecting all restaurants to all current and anticipated future applications. Several years ago, we implemented DASH, a next generation technology platform for our restaurant point of sale system in Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52 restaurants and a new meal pacing system in Olive Garden and Red Lobster restaurants. The new meal pacing system is designed to properly pace the preparation of menu items, based on cook-times, to enhance the guests experience and enhance restaurant capacity by increasing table turns.
In the past year, we essentially completed integrating the LongHorn Steakhouse and The Capital Grille restaurant businesses into the Companys core business processes and applications. The DASH point of sale system implementation was completed in June 2009. During the past year, we also implemented a web-based Labor Management system in Olive Garden restaurants, which has been in use for some time at Red Lobster and Bahama Breeze, and moved substantially all of our data center and network operations to the new data center located at the new restaurant support center campus.
Restaurant hardware and software support for all of our restaurant concepts, including the newly integrated LongHorn Steakhouse and The Capital Grille concepts, is provided or coordinated from the restaurant support center in Orlando, Florida, seven days a week, 24 hours a day. A communications network sends and receives critical business data to and from the restaurants throughout the day and night, providing timely and extensive information on business activity in every location. The new restaurant support center houses our data center, which contains sufficient computing power to process information from all restaurants quickly and efficiently. Our information is processed in a secure environment to protect both the actual data and the physical assets. We guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan, which includes storing critical business information off-site, testing the disaster recovery plan at a host-site facility and providing on-site power backup via a large diesel generator. We use internally developed proprietary software, as well as purchased software, with proven, non-proprietary hardware. This allows processing power to be distributed effectively to each of our restaurants.
As noted above under Purchasing and Distribution, we are in the process of expanding iKitchen to our regional suppliers. During fiscal 2010, we will begin efforts to strengthen existing tools used to forecast demand for product level information throughout the supply chain.
Our management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates will position us well to support current needs and future growth. We are committed to maintaining an industry leadership position in information systems and computing technology. We use a strategic information systems planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning. Information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic, financial, regulatory and other business advantage criteria.
9 Table of Contents Competition The restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food, price, service, restaurant location, personnel, concept, attractiveness of facilities, and effectiveness of advertising and marketing. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing restaurants; and consumers discretionary purchasing power. We compete within each market with national and regional chains and locally-owned restaurants for customers, management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites. We also face growing competition from the supermarket industry, which offers convenient meals in the form of improved entres and side dishes from the deli section. We expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas.
Other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled Purchasing and Distribution, Advertising and Marketing and Information Technology in this Item1 and in our Risk Factors in Item1A of this Form 10-K.
Trademarks, Service Marks, Franchises and Joint Ventures We regard our Darden Restaurants  , Red Lobster  , Olive Garden  , LongHorn Steakhouse  , The Capital Grille  , Bahama Breeze  , and Seasons 52  service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and as being important to our marketing efforts. Our policy is to pursue registration of our important service marks and trademarks and to oppose vigorously any infringement of them. Generally, with appropriate renewal and use, the registration of our service marks and trademarks will continue indefinitely.
All but three of our 1,773 restaurants in operation at May31, 2009 are Company-owned and operated. Those three restaurants are located in Central Florida and are owned by joint ventures managed by us. The joint ventures pay management fees to us, and we control the joint ventures use of our service marks. We have one unaffiliated franchisee with the right under an area development and franchise agreement to operate franchised LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants in Puerto Rico. As of May31, 2009, this franchisee operated five LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants in Puerto Rico. Our only restaurant operations outside of North America are conducted through an area development and franchise agreement with an unaffiliated Japanese corporation. This corporation operated 25 Red Lobster restaurants in Japan as of May31, 2009. We do not have an ownership interest in this corporation, but we receive royalty income under the franchise agreement. The amount of income we derive from these joint venture and franchise arrangements is not material to our consolidated financial statements.
Seasonality Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally. During fiscal 2009, our average sales per restaurant were highest in the summer and spring, followed by the winter, and lowest in the fall. During fiscal 2008 and 2007, our average sales per restaurant were highest in the spring and winter, followed by the summer, and lowest in the fall. Holidays, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions.Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.
Government Regulation We are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business. Each of our restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. The development and operation of restaurants depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations. To date, we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals.
During fiscal 2009, 9.1 percent of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages. Regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site (in most cases, on an annual basis), and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. These regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant operation, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, 10 Table of Contents inventory control and handling, and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. The failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these licenses would adversely affect the restaurants operations. We also are subject in certain states to dram-shop statutes, which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person who then causes injury to himself or a third party. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance.
We also are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws governing such matters as overtime, tip credits, working conditions, safety standards, and hiring and employment practices. Changes in these laws during fiscal 2009 have not had a material effect on our operations.
We currently are operating under a Tip Rate Alternative Commitment (TRAC) agreement with the Internal Revenue Service. Through increased educational and other efforts in the restaurants, the TRAC agreement reduces the likelihood of potential chain-wide employer-only FICA assessments for unreported tips.
We are subject to federal and state environmental regulations, but these rules have not had a material effect on our operations. During fiscal 2009, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated.
Our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and related state accessibility statutes. Under the ADA and related state laws, we must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment, and when constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of our restaurants, we must make those facilities accessible.
We are subject to laws and regulations relating to nutritional content, nutritional labeling, product safety and menu labeling. Multi-jurisdictional regulations relating to nutritional labeling may lead to increased operational complexity and expenses and may impact guest behavior.

Item1A.
RISK FACTORS Various risks and uncertainties could affect our business. Any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. It is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. Therefore, the following is not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.
We face intense competition, and if we are unable to continue to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
The full service dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing, service, location, personnel and type and quality of food, and there are many well-established competitors. We compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locally-owned restaurants. We also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services, particularly in the supermarket industry which offers convenient meals in the form of improved entres and side dishes from the deli section. We compete primarily on the quality, variety and value perception of menu items. The number and location of restaurants, type of concept, quality and efficiency of service, attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors. We anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors. If we are unable to continue to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
Certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and certain general economic factors including unemployment, energy prices and interest rates that are largely out of our control may adversely affect our results of operations.
Our business results depend on a number of industry-specific and general economic factors, many of which are beyond our control. The full service dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in national, regional and local economic conditions, seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes, consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences, including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits, and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant concepts. The performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends, severe weather including hurricanes, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants.
General economic conditions may also adversely affect our results of operations. Recessionary economic cycles, such as the one currently being experienced in the U.S and many other global economies, a protracted economic slowdown, a worsening economy, increased unemployment, increased energy prices, rising interest rates or other industry-wide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings. Job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies and falling home prices could cause customers to make fewer discretionary purchases, and any significant decrease in our customer traffic or average profit per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance. In addition, if gasoline, natural gas, electricity and other energy costs increase, and credit card, home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates, our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine out, may spend less on each dining out occasion, or may choose more inexpensive restaurants.
13 Table of Contents Furthermore, we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, heightened security requirements, or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure, such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems, could have on our operations, the economy or consumer confidence generally. Any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures.
Unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our customers could increase our costs, reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing, any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
The price and availability of food, ingredients and utilities used by our restaurants could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.
Our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food, ingredients, utilities and other related costs over which we may have little control. Operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities, including shrimp, lobster, crab and other seafood, as well as beef, pork, chicken, cheese and produce. The introduction of or changes to tariffs on imported shrimp or other food products could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products. We are subject to the general risks of inflation. Our restaurants operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as electricity and natural gas, whether as a result of inflation or otherwise, on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply. In addition, interruptions to the availability of gas, electric, water or other utilities, whether due to aging infrastructure, weather conditions, fire, animal damage, trees, digging accidents or other reasons largely out of our control, may adversely affect our operations. Our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations.
We may lose revenue or incur increased costs if our restaurants experience shortages or interruptions in the delivery of food and other products from our third party vendors and suppliers.
Possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants caused by inclement weather, natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes, the inability of our vendors to obtain credit in a tightened credit market or remain solvent given disruptions in the financial markets, or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. We may have a limited number of suppliers for certain of our products. Supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our restaurant operations. If we temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular items from a restaurants menu, that restaurant may experience a significant reduction in revenue during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our customers changing their dining habits.
We may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs.
Our restaurant operations are subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working conditions, overtime and tip credits. As federal and state minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage. Labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs. This in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales. Conversely, if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our profitability may decline. In addition, the current premiums that we pay for our insurance (including workers compensation, general liability, property, health, and directors and officers liability) may increase at any time, thereby further increasing our costs. The dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers compensation and general liability insurance, for which we carry high per-claim deductibles, may also increase at any time, thereby further increasing our costs. Further, the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses.
14 Table of Contents The loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets.
Our future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other employees. Our future growth also depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage our restaurants. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and other employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our projected growth. A loss of key employees or a significant shortage of high quality restaurant employees could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets.
We rely heavily on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or breach of security of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.
We rely heavily on information systems across our operations, including for management of our supply chain, point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations, and significant capital investments could be required to remediate the problem.
Increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our results of operations.
If our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions, if our advertising, media or marketing expenses increase, or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
We may experience higher-than-anticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing, relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
Our revenues and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing, relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants. We incur substantial pre-opening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close, relocate or remodel existing restaurants. The expenses of opening, closing, relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated. An increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
Litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, consumers, suppliers, shareholders or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of our services, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Unfavorable publicity could harm our business.
Multi-unit restaurant businesses such as ours can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from complaints or litigation or general publicity regarding poor food quality, food-borne illness, personal injury, food tampering, adverse health effects of consumption of various food products or high-calorie foods (including obesity) or other concerns. Negative publicity may also result from actual or alleged violations by our restaurants of dram shop laws which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or to a third party. Regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid, unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants, or only to a single restaurant, could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand. Adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of food safety, or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
15 Table of Contents Health concerns arising from outbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business.
The United States and other countries have experienced, or may experience in the future, outbreaks of viruses, such as norovirus, Avian Flu or SARS, and H1N1 or swine flu, or other diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as mad cow disease. To the extent that a virus or disease is food-borne, or perceived to be food-borne, future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product. For example, health concerns relating to the consumption of beef or to specific events such as the outbreak of mad cow disease may adversely impact sales at LongHorn Steakhouse and The Capital Grille restaurants that offer beef as a primary menu item. In addition, public concern over avian flu may cause fear about the consumption of chicken, eggs and other products derived from poultry. The inability to serve beef or poultry-based products would restrict our ability to provide a variety of menu items to our guests. If we change a restaurant concept or menu in response to such concerns, we may lose customers who do not prefer the new concept or menu, and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new customer base to produce the revenue needed to make the restaurant profitable. We also may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of such a concept change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors. If a virus is transmitted by human contact, our employees or guests could become infected, or could choose, or be advised, to avoid gathering in public places, any of which could adversely affect our restaurant guest traffic, and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants, receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level. We also could be adversely affected if jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures, seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations. Even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business.
A lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.
The success of our restaurants depends in large part on their location. As demographic and economic patterns change, current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable. Possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced revenues in those locations. In addition, desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation. The occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.
We are subject to a number of risks relating to federal, state and local regulation of our business that may increase our costs and decrease our profit margins.
The restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those relating to building and zoning requirements and those relating to the preparation and sale of food. The development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements. We are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health, sanitation, safety and fire standards and liquor licenses, federal and state laws governing our relationships with employees (including the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and applicable requirements concerning the minimum wage, overtime, family leave, tip credits, working conditions, safety standards and immigration status), federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. In addition, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials. At the federal level, it is uncertain what impact efforts to reform the health care system could have on our business, and whether it would result in affordable health care for our employees, or raise costs for both taxpayers and businesses. We also face risks from new and changing laws and regulations relating to nutritional content, nutritional labeling, product safety and menu labeling. Some states and localities have adopted or are considering policies that would require restaurants to provide calorie and other nutrition information on menus and menu boards. Legislation also may be considered at the federal level that would seek to establish a uniform nationwide approach detailing what information restaurants must provide. The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or 16 Table of Contents future laws and regulations, or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.
Our growth through the opening of new restaurants and the development or acquisition of new dining concepts may not be successful and could result in poor financial performance.
As part of our business strategy, we intend to continue to expand our current portfolio of restaurant concepts and to develop or acquire additional concepts that can be expanded profitably. This strategy involves numerous risks, and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives. We may not be able to open all of our planned new restaurants, and the new restaurants that we open may not be profitable or as profitable as our existing restaurants. New restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize, and even sales at successful newly-opened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation. The opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on sales levels at existing restaurants. Furthermore, we may not be able to develop or acquire additional concepts that are as profitable as our existing restaurants. Growth through acquisitions may involve additional risks. For example, we may pay too much for a concept relative to the actual economic return, be required to borrow funds to make our acquisition (which would increase our interest expense) or be unable to integrate an acquired concept into our operations.
The ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks, such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations, the need to obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals and liquor licenses) on a timely basis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors, the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets, the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay construction, increases in labor and building material costs, the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time, our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions. At each potential location, we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites, construction contractors, management personnel, hourly employees and other resources. If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues and earnings in future periods.
Our plans to expand our newer concepts Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52 that have not yet proven their long-term viability may not be successful, which could require us to make substantial further investments in those concepts and result in losses and impairments.
While each of our restaurant concepts, as well as each of our individual restaurants, are subject to the risks and uncertainties described above, there is an enhanced level of risk and uncertainty related to the operation and expansion of our newer concepts such as Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52. These concepts have not yet proven their long-term viability or growth potential. We have made substantial investments in the development and expansion of each of these concepts, and further investment is required. While we have implemented a number of changes to operations at Bahama Breeze, and believe we have improved the guest experience and unit economics sufficiently to restart modest unit growth in fiscal 2009, there can be no assurance that these changes will continue to be successful or that new unit growth will occur. Seasons 52 also is in the very early stages of its development and will require additional resources to support further growth. In each case, these brands will continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties that accompany any emerging restaurant concept.
We may not realize the full anticipated benefits of the RARE acquisition.
There can be no assurance that the RARE acquisition will result in the realization of the full anticipated benefits. We acquired RARE with the expectation that the acquisition will result in various benefits for the combined company including, among others, business and growth opportunities and significant synergies from 17 Table of Contents increased efficiency and effectiveness in purchasing, distribution and other restaurant and corporate support. However, we may not be able to realize the full synergies, goodwill, business opportunities and growth prospects anticipated in connection with the acquisition. We may experience increased competition that limits our ability to expand our business, and may not be able to capitalize on expected business opportunities if general industry and business conditions deteriorate. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors. If these factors limit our ability to achieve the full anticipated benefits of the acquisition, our expectations of future results of operations, including the synergies expected to result from the acquisition, may not be met. If such difficulties are encountered or if such synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects are not realized, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
An impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired. We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We compare the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit. If the carrying value is less than the fair value, no impairment exists. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication of impairment. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment exists. Factors may include, among others: a significant decline in our expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates. Any adverse change in these factors would have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. We compute the amount of impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. We are required to record a non-cash impairment charge if the testing performed indicates that goodwill has been impaired.
We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, primarily the LongHorn Steakhouse  and The Capital Grille  trademarks, to determine if they are definite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.
As with goodwill, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily tradenames) for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. We estimate the fair value of the trademarks based on an income valuation model using the relief from royalty method, which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademarks and a discount rate.
We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
We incurred substantial additional indebtedness to finance the RARE acquisition, which may decrease our business flexibility and increase our borrowing costs.
Our consolidated indebtedness following the RARE acquisition is substantially greater than our indebtedness prior to the acquisition. The increased indebtedness and higher debt-to-equity ratio of our company, as compared to that which existed on a historical basis, will have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs.
18 Table of Contents Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it may:  require a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness and reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate requirements;  limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, additional acquisitions or general corporate requirements, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and  limit our flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions as compared to our competitors.
There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity. A default under our debt instruments may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing.
Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control.
Failure of our internal controls over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results.
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. Our growth and acquisition of other restaurant companies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. A significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock.
Disruptions in the financial markets may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit and consumer spending patterns and may increase pension plan expenses.
Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Global credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil in recent months, characterized by the bankruptcy, failure or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States and other governments. These events may adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged, and the availability and cost of credit in the future. There can be no assurances that we will be able to arrange credit on terms we believe are acceptable or that permit us to finance our business with historical margins. These events have also adversely affected the U.S. and world economy, and any new or continuing disruptions in the financial markets may also adversely affect the U.S. and world economy, which could negatively impact consumer spending patterns. There can be no assurances as to how or when this period of turmoil will be resolved. Changes in the capital markets could also have significant effects on our pension plan. Our pension income or expense is affected by factors including the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for the pension plans for some of our employees, the weighted average asset allocation and long-term rate of return of our pension plan assets, the discount rate used to determine the service and interest cost components of our net periodic pension cost and assumed rates of increase in our employees future compensation. If our pension plan assets do not achieve positive rates of return, or if our estimates and assumed rates are not accurate, our earnings may decrease because net periodic pension costs would rise and we could be required to provide additional funds to cover our obligations to employees under the pension plan.
19 Table of Contents Volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to hedge exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings.
We use or may use derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs, including but not limited to coffee, wheat, soybean oil, pork, beef and natural gas. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently, resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported as a component of cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings included in our consolidated financial statements. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments.

PROPERTIES Restaurant Properties  Continuing Operations As of May31, 2009, we operated 1,773 restaurants (consisting of 690 Red Lobster, 691 Olive Garden, 321 LongHorn Steakhouse, 37 The Capital Grille, 24 Bahama Breeze, eight Seasons 52, one The Old Grist Mill Tavern and one Hemenways Seafood Grille& Oyster Bar restaurants) in the following locations: Alabama (38) Arizona (39) Arkansas (13) California (102) Colorado (32) Connecticut (14) Delaware (7) District of Columbia (1) Florida (198) Georgia (114) Hawaii (1) Idaho (8) Illinois (64) Indiana (49) Iowa (15) Kansas (16) Kentucky (22) Louisiana (14) Maine (9) Maryland (34) Massachusetts (31) Michigan (58) Minnesota (25) Mississippi (13) Missouri (43) Montana (2) Nebraska (8) Nevada (14) New Hampshire (10) New Jersey (46) New Mexico (11) New York (52) North Carolina (53) North Dakota (5) Ohio (101) Oklahoma (21) Oregon (12) Pennsylvania (85) Rhode Island (4) South Carolina (35) South Dakota (4) Tennessee (50) Texas (130) Utah (16) Vermont (2) Virginia (56) Washington (28) West Virginia (11) Wisconsin (19) Wyoming (3) Canada (35) Of these 1,773 restaurants open on May31, 2009, 926 were located on owned sites and 847 were located on leased sites. The 847 leases are classified as follows: Land-Only Leases (we own buildings and equipment) 665 Ground and Building Leases 77 Space/In-Line/Other Leases 105 Total 847 Properties  General During fiscal 1999, we formed two subsidiary corporations, each of which elected to be taxed as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. These elections limit the activities of both corporations to holding certain real estate assets. The formation of these two REITs is designed primarily to assist us in managing our real estate portfolio and possibly to provide a vehicle to access capital markets in the future.
Both REITs are non-public REITs. Through our subsidiary companies, we indirectly own 100 percent of all voting stock and greater than 99.5 percent of the total value of each REIT. For financial reporting purposes, both REITs are included in our consolidated financial statements.
All of the buildings that make up our executive offices, culinary center, training facilities and our supporting warehouses in Orange County (Orlando metro area), Florida, are currently leased. On June20, 2006, we entered into an agreement to sell and lease back the 10 buildings that we previously owned which comprised the majority of 20 Table of Contents our current Restaurant Support Center. The sale and the commencement of our leases for those buildings occurred in August 2006. The leases for those buildings were recently amended to eliminate additional renewal options and to provide for a termination in late December, 2009.
We purchased several adjacent parcels of vacant land in Orange County, Florida, and plan to relocate our headquarters to this site. Construction of the main headquarters building, data center and parking deck is nearly complete. We expect the Restaurant Support Center campus at this new location to offer a more collaborative and unified environment with additional room for future growth. We currently project completing the first phase of this development and relocating to the new Restaurant Support Center during the second quarter of fiscal 2010.
As part of the acquisition of RARE, we acquired ownership of the former RARE executive offices and central training facility located in six office buildings in Atlanta, Georgia. We sold one of those buildings. The remaining buildings are currently being marketed for sale.
Except in limited instances, our present restaurant sites and other facilities are not subject to mortgages or encumbrances securing money borrowed by us from outside sources. In our opinion, our current buildings and equipment generally are in good condition, suitable for their purposes and adequate for our current needs. See also Note 5 Land, Buildings and Equipment, Net and Note 14 Leases under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, incorporated herein by reference.
Item3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are subject to private lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business.A number of these lawsuits, proceedings and claims may exist at any given time. These matters typically involve claims from guests, employees and others related to operational issues common to the restaurant industry, and can also involve infringement of, or challenges to, our trademarks. While the resolution of a lawsuit, proceeding or claim may have an impact on our financial results for the period in which it is resolved, we believe that the final disposition of the lawsuits, proceedings and claims in which we are currently involved, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The following is a brief description of the more significant of these matters. In view of the inherent uncertainties of litigation, the outcome of any unresolved matter described below cannot be predicted at this time, nor can the amount of any potential loss be reasonably estimated.
Like other restaurant companies and retail employers, in a few states we have been faced with allegations of purported class-wide wage and hour violations. In April 2009, a former Red Lobster employee filed a purported class action in New York state court, alleging wage and hour violations and meal and rest break practices in violation of New York law, seeking an unspecified amount of damages. We believe that our practices were lawful, and intend to vigorously defend our position in this action.
In July 2008, an action was filed in California state court by a group of former Red Lobster managers alleging that the salaried general managers of the restaurants were not paid minimum wage for all hours worked because they were not paid for time spent attending various seminars and conferences.In addition, the managers claim that they were not provided with rest and meal breaks pursuant to California law.The complaint seeks to have the suit certified as a class action. Although we believe that our policies and practices were lawful, following mediation with the plaintiffs we reached a settlement of these claims under for approximately $0.1 million. We accrued this amount during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and expect to pay the settlement amount during fiscal 2010 at the completion of the settlement process.
In August 2008, an action was filed in California state court by a former Red Lobster server alleging that Red Lobsters scheduling practices resulted in failure to properly pay reporting time (minimum shift) pay as well as to pay minimum wage, to provide itemized wage statements, and to timely pay employees upon the termination of their employment. The complaint sought to have the suit certified as a class action. Although we believed that our policies and practices were lawful, we reached a preliminary settlement of this matter under which we would pay approximately $0.5 million. We paid the settlement amount during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 at the completion of the settlement process.
21 Table of Contents On September18, 2008, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio alleging that African-American employees of the Bahama Breeze restaurant in Beachwood, Ohio were subjected to discriminatory employment practices in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. The complaint seeks to enjoin the alleged discriminatory practices and seeks compensatory damages for the employees. We believe that our practices were lawful, and we intend to vigorously defend our position in this action.
On March13, 2008, a purported class action complaint alleging violation of the federal securities laws was filed by an institutional shareholder against Darden and certain of our current officers, one of whom is also a director, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. The complaint was filed on behalf of all purchasers of Dardens common stock between June19, 2007 and December18, 2007 (the Class). The complaint alleges that during that period, the defendants issued false and misleading statements in press releases and public filings that misrepresented and failed to disclose certain information, and that as a result, had no reasonable basis for statements about Dardens prospects and guidance for fiscal 2008. The complaint alleges claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The plaintiff seeks to recover unspecified damages on behalf of the Class. Darden and the individual defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. On July2, 2009, the magistrate judge assigned to the action entered a Report and Recommendation recommending dismissal of all claims. On July17, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an objection to the Report and Recommendation with the District Court Judge. We intend to vigorously defend our position in this action.
By letter dated May9, 2008, a putative shareholder demanded that our Board of Directors take action to remedy alleged breaches of fiduciary duty to Darden by certain officers and directors. The letter contains similar allegations to those in the purported class action described above regarding the alleged issuance of false and misleading statements and omissions regarding Dardens financial results and sales growth. On September10, 2008, this same putative shareholder on behalf of nominal defendant Darden filed a shareholder derivative civil action in the Circuit Court of the Ninth Judicial Circuit of Orange County, Florida against Darden, our Board of Directors, and several of our senior executives, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The allegations in the complaint arise out of the same facts alleged in the purported class action complaint referenced above. In particular, the complaint alleges that during the period June19, 2007 and December18, 2007, certain of the defendants issued false and misleading statements in press releases and public filings that misrepresented and failed to disclose certain information about Dardens prospects and earnings guidance for fiscal 2008, and that certain defendants benefited from these false and misleading statements in selling Darden stock at an inflated price. The complaint seeks to recover in favor of Darden, damages sustained by Darden as a result of the defendants alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, and the imposition of a constructive trust in favor of Darden for the amount of proceeds realized by certain defendants from the sale of Darden stock. Fees and costs, as well as equitable relief, are also sought. The Board has formed a special litigation committee to evaluate these claims. The shareholder derivative action has been stayed pending the special litigation committees review.

Item9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)) as of May31, 2009, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May31, 2009.
During the fiscal quarter ended May31, 2009, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

OTHER INFORMATION At a meeting held on July13, 2009, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Companys Board of Directors took the following actions, subject to further approval by the other independent directors on the Board of Directors that was obtained effective July23, 2009, with regard to compensatory arrangements for the Companys executive officers.
Revised Form of Management Continuity Agreement In order to conform to what the Company believes are current best practices for executive change of control severance agreements by comparable companies, the Committee approved a revised form of Amended and Restated Management Continuity Agreement (the New Form Continuity Agreement) that it anticipates will be executed with each of our executive officers in due course. The New Form Continuity Agreement includes the following changes as compared to the Amended and Restated Management Continuity Agreements currently in effect with our executive officers (Existing Agreements). The New Form Continuity Agreement:  Eliminates a provision that permits executives to resign voluntarily during the 30-day period following the first anniversary of a change of control and receive severance compensation. The New Form Continuity Agreement now has a double trigger in which an executive would receive payouts following a change in control only if the executive lost his or her job, or resigned for good reason such as a substantial diminution of job duties within 24 months following the change of control;  Eliminates the so-called golden parachute excise tax gross up provision that applies in the Existing Agreements in certain limited circumstances;  Updates the definition of change of control to mean certain specific and objective events that the Committee determined would result in an actual transfer of control of the Company;  Reduces the bonus component of severance payments from the highest bonus paid to the executive in the three years prior to the change of control, as provided in the Existing Agreements, to the average bonus paid to the executive in the three years prior to the change of control; and  Eliminates severance benefits for terminations of employment after the second anniversary of a change of control.
The New Form Continuity Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10(i) to this Form 10-K, and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of that document.
24 Table of Contents Amendment of Management and Professional Incentive Plan The Committee approved the Amended and Restated Darden Restaurants, Inc. Management and Professional Incentive Plan (the MIP). Under the MIP, both before and after this amendment, no amendments, modification or termination may be made after a change of control (as defined) without the written consent of a majority of covered participants determined immediately before such change of control. The MIP has been amended to conform the definition of change of control to the definition used in the New Form Continuity Agreement as discussed above.
The Amended and Restated MIP is filed as Exhibit 10(e) to this Form 10-K, and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of that document.
Amendments to Form of Performance Stock Unit (PSU) Award Agreement for New Awards and Certain Outstanding PSU Award Agreements The Committee approved changes to the form of the Darden Restaurants, Inc. 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (2002 Plan) PSU Award Agreement to be used for the Companys executive officers commencing in fiscal 2010. Amendments to this form include the following changes.
Updating the definition of change of control in a manner consistent with the New Form Continuity Agreements discussed above;  Adding a so-called clawback provision which mandates in specified circumstances the return (or forfeiture) of amounts if the Company must restate its financial statements due to fraud and the Committee determines that the executive knowingly participated in the fraud. The return of amounts paid (or forfeiture of amounts owed) may be required at any time within two years after the restatement; and  Changing the performance measure for PSU awards so they are earned based on three-year Company performance relative to sales and earnings targets, rather than five-year vesting based on sales and return on gross investment. Under the new form of PSU Award Agreement, if the Company achieves performance objectives consistent with performance in the top quartile of the S&P 500 for the three-year period as measured by sales growth and earnings per share growth weighted equally, 100% of the PSU grant for that period will be earned. The Committee generally will determine the actual number of PSUs earned by multiplying the target number of PSUs by the average level of achievement of the goals established annually by the Committee during each year of the performance period (which can vary from 0% to 150% of the target number), plus an additional cash amount equal to the dollar value of dividends paid on the Companys common stock. Dividend equivalents will not be paid on unvested PSUs.
The new form of PSU Award Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10(p) to this Form 10-K, and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of that document.
The Committee also approved amendments to outstanding PSU Award Agreements with the Companys executive officers granted for five-year performance cycles beginning in fiscal 2007, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009, to conform the vesting and performance measure provisions in those agreements to those in the Companys revised form of PSU Award Agreement for fiscal 2010. Prior to the amendments, the award opportunity under the outstanding PSU Award Agreements could be earned based on the Companys sales growth and return on gross investment for new and relocated restaurants. The amended agreements provide that with respect to each of the remaining years in each applicable performance cycle, an award opportunity can be earned based on the Companys sales and earnings performance consistent with performance in the top quartile of the S&P 500, as further described above for the amended form of PSU Award Agreement for fiscal 2010.
The Form of Amendment to Exhibit A to the Fiscal 2007, 2008 and 2009 PSU Award Agreements under the 2002 Plan is filed as Exhibit 10(t) to this Form 10-K, and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of that document.
