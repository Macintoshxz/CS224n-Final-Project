PART I  Item 1.  BUSINESS  Introduction       Darden  Restaurants,  Inc.  is the  largest  publicly  held  casual  dining restaurant  company in the  world1,  and served over 300  million  meals  during fiscal 2003. As of May 25, 2003,  we operated  1,271  restaurants  in the United States and Canada.  In the United States,  we operated  1,234  restaurants in 49 states (the exception  being Alaska),  including 642 Red  Lobster(R),  518 Olive Garden(R),  34 Bahama  Breeze(R),  39 Smokey  Bones(R)  BBQ and one Seasons 52SM restaurants. In Canada, we operated 37 restaurants, including 31 Red Lobster and six Olive Garden  restaurants.  We own and operate all of our restaurants in the United States and Canada, with no franchising.  Of our 1,271 restaurants and the one Olive Garden Cafe open on May 25, 2003,  803 were located on owned sites and 469 were  located  on  leased  sites.  In  Japan,  we  licensed  33 Red  Lobster restaurants  to  an  unaffiliated   Japanese   corporation   that  operates  the restaurants under an Area Development and Franchise Agreement.       Darden is a Florida  corporation  incorporated  in March  1995,  and is the parent company of GMRI,  Inc.,  also a Florida  corporation.  GMRI and our other subsidiaries own the operating  assets of the  restaurants.  GMRI was originally incorporated in March 1968 as Red Lobster Inns of America, Inc.       Our principal  executive offices and restaurant  support center are located at 5900 Lake Ellenor Drive,  Orlando,  Florida 32809,  telephone (407) 245-4000. Our corporate  website address is  www.darden.com  (or, for employees inside our computer firewall, www.dardenusa.com).  We make our filed reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, and Section 16 reports on Forms 3, 4 and 5, and all  amendments to those  reports  available  free of  charge  on our  website  the same day as the reports are filed with or furnished to the Securities  and Exchange  Commission. Information  on our website is not deemed to be  incorporated  by reference into this Form 10-K.  Unless the  context  indicates  otherwise,  all  references  to Darden,   "we",   "our"  or  "us"  include  Darden,   GMRI  and  our  respective subsidiaries.  Background       We opened our first  restaurant,  a Red Lobster,  in  Lakeland,  Florida in 1968.  Red Lobster was founded by William B. Darden,  for whom we are named.  We were acquired by General Mills,  Inc. in 1970. In May 1995, we became a separate publicly  held company when General Mills  distributed  all  outstanding  Darden stock to General Mills' stockholders.       The number of Red Lobster and Olive Garden  restaurants  open at the end of fiscal 2003  increased  by six and 28,  respectively,  as compared to the end of fiscal 2002. Red Lobster has grown from six  restaurants in operation at the end of fiscal 1970 to 673 units in North  America by the end of fiscal  2003.  Olive Garden, an internally developed concept, opened its first restaurant in Orlando, Florida  in fiscal  1983,  and by the end of  fiscal  2003 had  expanded  to 524 restaurants and one food court cafe in North America.       Bahama Breeze is an internally developed concept with a Caribbean theme. In fiscal 1996, Bahama Breeze opened its first restaurant in Orlando,  Florida.  At the end of fiscal 2003, there were 34 Bahama Breeze restaurants.       Smokey Bones is also an internally developed concept featuring barbeque and other  American-style  favorites served in an inviting lodge setting.  The first restaurant was opened in fiscal 2000 in Orlando,  Florida.  At the end of fiscal 2003, there were 39 Smokey Bones restaurants.       In February  2003,  we opened a new test  restaurant  in  Orlando,  Florida called  Seasons  52SM. It is a casually  sophisticated  fresh grill and wine bar with  seasonally  inspired  menus  offering  fresh  ingredients  to create great tasting, nutritionally balanced meals that are lower in calories than comparable restaurant meals.  ---------------------------------------- 1Source:  Nation's  Restaurant News,  "Special  Report:  Top 100," June 30, 2003 (based on revenues from company- owned restaurants).                                         2 The table  below  shows our  growth  and  lists the  number of  restaurants operated by Red Lobster,  Olive Garden,  Bahama Breeze, Smokey Bones and Seasons 52 as of the end of each fiscal year since 1970.

(2)  Includes only Red Lobster,  Olive Garden,  Bahama Breeze,  Smokey Bones and      Seasons 52 restaurants. Does not include other restaurant concepts operated      by us in these years that are no longer owned or operated by us.

(4)  Emerging  Issues  Task Force  Issue 00-14  "Accounting  for  Certain  Sales      Incentives"  requires  sales  incentives to be classified as a reduction of      sales.  We adopted  Issue 00-14 in the fourth  quarter of fiscal 2002.  For      purposes of this presentation, sales incentives have been reclassified as a      reduction  of sales for fiscal 1998  through  2003.  Sales  incentives  for      fiscal years prior to 1998 have not been reclassified.
3 Strategy       The  restaurant  industry is generally  considered  to be comprised of four segments: quick service,  midscale,  casual dining and fine dining. The industry is highly  fragmented and includes many independent  operators and small chains. We  believe  that  capable  operators  of strong  multi-unit  concepts  have the opportunity  to increase  their share of the casual dining  segment.  We plan to grow by increasing the number of  restaurants  in each of our existing  concepts and by  developing  or  acquiring  additional  concepts  that  can  be  expanded profitably.       While we are a leader in the casual  dining  segment,  we know we cannot be successful  without a clear sense of who we are. Our core purpose is "To nourish and  delight  everyone we serve."  This core  purpose is  supported  by our core values:       o integrity and fairness;      o respect and caring;      o diversity;      o always learning/always teaching;      o being "of service";      o teamwork; and      o excellence.       Our mission is to be "The best in casual dining,  now and for generations." Three strategic imperatives or "building blocks" support our mission:       o leadership development as a core competency;      o service and hospitality excellence; and      o culinary and beverage excellence.       These strategic imperatives are supported by three key enablers:       o brand management skills;      o diversity competency; and      o technology solutions.       Continuing focus on our three building blocks,  supported by our commitment to brand management,  diversity and technology, provides a strong foundation for future growth.  Restaurant Concepts  Red Lobster       Red  Lobster is the largest  casual  dining,  seafood-specialty  restaurant operator in the United States. It offers an extensive menu featuring fresh fish, shrimp,  crab, lobster,  scallops and other seafood in a casual atmosphere.  The menu includes a variety of specialty seafood and non-seafood entrees, appetizers and desserts.       Dinner  entree  prices range from $8.99 to $27.99,  with certain fresh fish and lobster  items  available at market  price.  Lunch entree  prices range from $5.99 to $11.99,  and include side items and our signature Cheddar Bay biscuits. During fiscal 2003,  the average check per person was between $16.00 and $17.00, with  alcoholic  beverages  accounting  for about nine percent of Red  Lobster's sales. Red Lobster maintains  approximately 135 different menus across its trade areas to reflect  geographic  differences  in consumer  preferences,  prices and selections, as well as a lower-priced children's menu.       Fiscal 2003 was a record year in sales for Red Lobster, with total sales of $2.433  billion.  Sales were 4.1 percent  above the previous  year,  and average sales per  restaurant  for fiscal 2003 were $3.7 million - all record levels for Red  Lobster.  As of the  end  of  fiscal  2003,  Red  Lobster  had  enjoyed  22 consecutive quarters of U.S. same-restaurant sales increases.  Nevertheless, Red Lobster's  total sales in fiscal 2003 were lower than  expected.  Despite  lower food and beverage costs as a percent of sales, Red Lobster experienced increased expenses,  particularly                                         4 restaurant labor costs, restaurant expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses  and  depreciation  as a  percent  of sales.  This led to a decline  in operating profit during fiscal 2003 versus last year.  Olive Garden       Olive  Garden is the  market  share  leader  among  casual  dining  Italian restaurants  in the United  States.  Olive  Garden's  menu includes a variety of authentic Italian foods featuring fresh  ingredients,  and an expanded wine list that includes a broad selection of wines imported from Italy.  The menu includes antipasti  (appetizers);  soups,  salad and garlic  breadsticks;  baked  pastas; sauteed specialties with chicken,  seafood and fresh vegetables;  grilled meats; and a variety of desserts. Olive Garden also uses coffee imported from Italy for its espresso and cappuccino.       Most dinner entree prices range from $7.75 to $17.95, and most lunch entree prices range from $5.95 to $9.25. The price of each entree also includes as much fresh salad or soup and breadsticks as a guest desires.  During fiscal 2003, the average  check  per  person  was  $13.00 to  $14.00,  with  alcoholic  beverages accounting  for  about  nine  percent  of Olive  Garden's  sales.  Olive  Garden maintains  approximately 40 different dinner menus and 30 lunch menus across its trade areas to reflect geographic  differences in consumer  preferences,  prices and selections, as well as two lower-priced children's menus.       Fiscal 2003 was a record  year for both sales and profits at Olive  Garden. Olive Garden's total sales for fiscal 2003 were $1.990  billion,  up 6.8 percent from the prior  year,  and its annual  average  sales per  restaurant  were $3.9 million,  both record levels.  Olive Garden had 35 consecutive  quarters of U.S. same-restaurant  sales  increases as of the end of fiscal 2003.  Olive  Garden's sales gains,  combined with lower food and beverage  expense,  restaurant  labor costs and general and  administrative  expenses as a percent of sales, more than offset  increased  restaurant  and  marketing  expenses  as a percent  of sales, resulting in record annual operating profit during fiscal 2003.  Bahama Breeze       Bahama  Breeze  is a  Caribbean-themed  restaurant  that  offers  guests  a distinctive island dining experience. The first Bahama Breeze opened in 1996 and met with strong positive consumer response.  We continued to test the concept by opening a limited  number of  additional  restaurants  in each of the  following years,  and began  national  expansion  of the concept in 1998.  In fiscal 2003, sales  at  Bahama  Breeze   surpassed  $137  million  and  we  opened  five  new restaurants,  bringing the total to 34 restaurants.  The concept continues to be well  received by guests,  although its  financial  performance  has not met our overall expectations,  and we are making changes that we anticipate will improve its sales, financial performance and long-term potential.  These changes include testing lunch operations,  creating a new dinner menu and slowing new restaurant development (we plan to open four new Bahama Breeze  restaurants in fiscal 2004) while  reducing  the size of the building  and the related  capital  investment. However,  these  actions  are still in the test  phase and  results  will not be available  until late in fiscal 2004.  We expect Bahama Breeze to continue to be dilutive to earnings in fiscal 2004.  Smokey Bones       Smokey Bones features  barbequed pork,  beef and chicken,  as well as other authentic  American-style  favorites,  all served in a casual and inviting lodge setting that includes sports viewing on televisions.  We opened the first Smokey Bones in September  1999, and began national  expansion of the concept in fiscal 2002.  Sales  for  Smokey  Bones  were $93  million  in fiscal  2003.  There are currently 39 Smokey Bones  restaurants,  and we plan to open 25 to 30 new Smokey Bones  restaurants  in fiscal  2004.  We believe  that  Smokey  Bones has strong expansion  potential and is capable of achieving future sales of $500 million or more.  Recent and Planned Growth       During fiscal 2003, we opened 65 new restaurants  (excluding the relocation of  existing  restaurants  to new sites and the  rebuilding  of  restaurants  at existing sites) and closed four restaurants.  This resulted in a net increase of 61 restaurants  in fiscal 2003  (assuming the re-opening of one restaurant  that was  temporarily  closed  as of  the  end of  fiscal  2003).  We  plan  to  open approximately 57 to 71 new Red Lobster,  Olive Garden,  Bahama Breeze and Smokey Bones restaurants during fiscal 2004 (excluding  relocations and rebuilds).  Our actual  and  projected  new  openings  by  concept  (excluding  relocations  and rebuilds) are shown below.                                         5 Actual New               Projected New                                                           Restaurant Openings       Restaurant Openings                                                             Fiscal 2003(1)              Fiscal 2004                                                             --------------              ----------- Red Lobster................................                 11                        8-12          Olive Garden...............................                 28                       20-25          Bahama Breeze..............................                  5                           4          Smokey Bones...............................                 20                       25-30                                                                    ----                       -----                Totals...............................                 64                      57-71 (1) Excludes one Seasons 52 test restaurant.
Our objective is to continue to expand our current  portfolio of restaurant concepts,  and to develop or acquire  additional  concepts  that can be expanded profitably.  We are  currently  testing new ideas and  concepts,  and  expanding Bahama  Breeze  and  Smokey  Bones  nationally  in light of  favorable  consumer response.  We also evaluate potential  acquisition  candidates to assess whether they would satisfy our strategic and financial  objectives.  At present, we have not identified any specific acquisitions.       We will continue to focus on improving  operational returns at Olive Garden and Red Lobster,  and will limit new  restaurant  expansion of those concepts to high  potential  sites that we believe can generate  significant  returns on our investments.  Olive  Garden's  expansion  will  include its  recently  developed "Tuscan  Farmhouse"  design, an outgrowth of our collaboration  with Rocca delle Macie, a family-owned winery in Tuscany,  Italy. In addition,  we plan to expand Bahama  Breeze and Smokey  Bones at a pace that we believe  will enable each new restaurant  to capture the  concept's  full  potential.  The specific  number of openings  will  depend  on many  factors,  such as the  success  of the  changes discussed  above at Bahama  Breeze,  in addition to, in general,  our ability to locate appropriate sites,  negotiate  acceptable purchase or lease terms, obtain necessary local  governmental  permits,  complete  construction  and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel.       We consider  location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant's long-term  success,  and we  devote  significant  effort  to the site  selection process.  Prior to entering a market,  we conduct a thorough  study to determine the optimal  number and placement of  restaurants.  Our site  selection  process incorporates a variety of analytical  techniques to evaluate key factors.  These factors include trade area  demographics,  such as target population density and household  income levels;  competitive  influences in the trade area; the site's visibility,  accessibility and traffic volume; and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls, hotel/motel complexes, offices and universities. Members of senior management evaluate, inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition.  Constructing and opening a new restaurant  typically takes 120 to 180 days after the site is acquired and permits are obtained.       The following table illustrates the approximate average capital investment, size and dining  capacity of the 11 Red Lobster and 28 Olive Garden  restaurants that were  opened  during  fiscal  2003  (excluding  relocations,  rebuilds  and conversions of existing restaurants).

6 For Bahama  Breeze,  we are in the  process  of  designing  a new  building prototype with a lower capital investment and a simpler design that we expect to use for the first time in fiscal 2004. For Smokey Bones, we continue to seek out sites  where  existing  buildings  can be  converted  to Smokey  Bones,  and are locating new units in prime casual dining trade areas that we believe will allow us to realize  greater rates of return on investment  than were  generated  from certain early sites in less desirable locations.       We systematically  review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards.  When a restaurant falls below minimum  standards, we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes, and implement  marketing and operational plans to improve that restaurant's  performance.  If performance does  not  improve  to  acceptable  levels,  the  restaurant  is  evaluated  for relocation, closing or conversion to one of our other concepts.       During  fiscal 2003,  we  permanently  closed four and  relocated  five Red Lobster  restaurants in the United States.  During the same period, we relocated three Olive Garden restaurants in the United States.  Restaurant Operations       We believe  that  high-quality  restaurant  management  is  critical to our long-term  success.  We  also  believe  that  our  leadership  position,  strong success-oriented   culture  and  various  short-term  and  long-term   incentive programs,  including stock options and restricted stock, help attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers.       Our restaurant  management structure varies by concept and restaurant size. Each restaurant is led by a general manager and one to four additional managers, depending on the operating  complexity and sales volume of the restaurant.  Each restaurant also employs  approximately 65 to 140 hourly employees,  most of whom work part-time.  We issue detailed  operations  manuals  covering all aspects of restaurant  operations,  as well as food and beverage  manuals  which detail the preparation  procedures of our formulated  recipes.  The  restaurant  management teams are  responsible  for the day-to-day  operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating  standards.  At our two largest concepts, Red Lobster and Olive Garden,  restaurant  general managers report to directors, and each director is responsible  for seven to 14  restaurants.  Restaurants are visited  regularly by all levels of supervision to help ensure strict  adherence to all aspects of our standards.       Each concept's vice president or director of training, together with senior operations  executives,  is  responsible  for developing  and  maintaining  that concept's  operations  training programs.  These efforts include a 12-to 15-week training program for management  trainees,  and continuing  development programs for  managers,  supervisors  and  directors.  The  emphasis of the  training and development  programs  varies by restaurant  concept,  but includes  leadership, restaurant  business  management  and  culinary  skills.  We also  use a  highly structured  training  program  to  open  new  restaurants,  including  deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations.  The opening training teams  typically begin work one week prior to opening and remain at the new  restaurant  one  week  following  the  opening.   They  are  redeployed  as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant's operating staff.  Quality Assurance       Our Total  Quality  Department  helps ensure that all  restaurants  provide safe,  high-quality  food in a clean  and  safe  environment.  Through  rigorous physical  evaluation and testing at our North American  laboratories and through "point source  inspection" by our international  team of Quality  Specialists in several  foreign  countries,  we purchase only seafood that meets or exceeds our specifications.  We use  independent  third  parties  to  inspect  and  evaluate commodity  vendors.  In addition,  any commodity  supplier that produces a "high risk"  product is subject to a minimum  annual food safety  evaluation by Darden personnel.  We require our suppliers to maintain sound  manufacturing  practices and operate with the comprehensive HACCP food safety programs in place.       Since 1976, we have  maintained a  microbiological  laboratory to routinely test seafood and other  commodities for quality and  microbiological  safety. In addition,  Darden Total  Quality  Managers and third party  auditors  visit each restaurant  periodically  throughout  the year to review  food  handling  and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation.  The Total Quality managers  also serve as a liaison to regulatory  agencies on issues  relating to food safety.                                         7 Purchasing and Distribution       Our ability to ensure a consistent supply of high-quality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant concepts depends upon procurement from reliable  sources.  Our purchasing staff sources,  negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 2,000 suppliers in 45 countries. Suppliers must meet strict quality control  standards in the  development,  harvest,  catch and production of food products. Competitive bids, long-term contracts and long-term vendor  relationships  are  routinely  used to manage  availability  and cost of products.       We believe  that our  seafood  purchasing  capabilities  are a  significant competitive advantage.  Our purchasing staff travels routinely within the United States and  internationally  to source more than 100  varieties  of  top-quality seafood at competitive  prices.  We believe that we have  established  excellent long-term relationships with key seafood vendors, and usually source our product directly from  producers  (not brokers or  middlemen).  We operate a procurement office in Singapore,  our only purchasing  office outside of Orlando,  to source products  directly  from Asia.  While the supply of certain  seafood  species is volatile,  we believe that we have the ability to identify  alternative  seafood products and to adjust our menus as necessary. All other essential food products are  available,  or can be made available  upon short notice,  from  alternative qualified suppliers. Because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products, inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation  to  revenues.   Controlled   inventories  of  specified  products  are distributed  to  all  restaurants  through  independent  national   distribution companies.  Advertising and Marketing       We believe that we have  developed  significant  marketing and  advertising capabilities.  Our size  enables  us to be a dominant  advertiser  in the casual dining  segment of the  restaurant  industry.  We  leverage  the  efficiency  of national network television  advertising and supplement it with local television advertising.  Our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising and product promotions to attract  customers.  We implement periodic promotions  as  appropriate  to maintain and increase our sales and profits.  We also rely on radio and  newspaper  advertising,  as well as newspaper and direct mail couponing programs, as appropriate, to attract customers. We have developed and consistently use sophisticated  consumer  marketing  research  techniques to monitor customer satisfaction and evolving expectations.  Employees       At the end of fiscal 2003, we employed  approximately  140,700 persons.  Of these  employees,  approximately  1,300 were  corporate  or  restaurant  concept personnel  located  in  our  restaurant  support  center  in  Orlando,  Florida, approximately 5,850 were restaurant  management  personnel in the restaurants or in field offices,  and the remainder were hourly  restaurant  personnel.  Of the restaurant support center employees, approximately 60% were management personnel and  the  balance  were  administrative  or  office  employees.   Our  operating executives  have an  average  of more than 14 years of  experience  with us. The restaurant general managers average 11 years with us. We believe that we provide working  conditions and  compensation  that compare  favorably with those of our competitors.  Most  employees,  other than  restaurant  management and corporate management,  are paid on an hourly basis. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.  Management Information Systems       We strive for leadership in the restaurant  business by using technology as a competitive  advantage.  Since 1975, computers located in the restaurants have been used to assist in the management of the  restaurants.  We have  implemented systems targeted at improved financial control, cost management,  enhanced guest service and improved employee effectiveness.  Management information systems are designed to be used across restaurant concepts,  yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each  restaurant  concept.  In fiscal 2002, we implemented a suite of web-enabled  financial systems and a high-speed data network connecting all  restaurants  to all current and  anticipated  future  applications.  During fiscal 2003, we completed an upgrade of our human  resource  (including  payroll and benefits) systems using web-enabled and fully integrated application suites.                                         8 Restaurant  hardware and software  support is provided or coordinated  from the restaurant support center in Orlando, Florida, seven days a week, 24 hours a day. A communications  network sends and receives  critical business data to and from  the  restaurants  throughout  the  day and  night,  providing  timely  and extensive  information on business  activity in every  location.  The restaurant support center houses our data center, which contains sufficient computing power to  process  information  from all  restaurants  quickly  and  efficiently.  Our information  is  processed in a secured  environment  to protect both the actual data  and the  physical  assets.  We  guard  against  business  interruption  by maintaining a disaster  recovery plan, which includes storing critical  business information off-site,  testing the disaster recovery plan at a hot-site facility and  providing  on-site  power  backup  via a  large  diesel  generator.  We use internally developed proprietary  software, as well as purchased software,  with proven, non-proprietary hardware. This allows processing power to be distributed effectively to each of our restaurants.       Our  management  believes its current  systems and the  upgrades  currently underway will position us well to support  current needs and future  growth.  We are committed to  maintaining  an industry  leadership  position in  information systems  and  computing  technology.  We  use a  strategic  information  systems planning  process that involves  senior  management  and is integrated  into our overall business  planning.  Information  systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic, financial, regulatory and other business advantage criteria.  Competition       The restaurant  industry is intensely  competitive with respect to the type and quality of food, price, service,  restaurant location,  personnel,  concept, attractiveness  of facilities,  and  effectiveness  of advertising and marketing programs.  The  restaurant  business  is often  affected  by changes in consumer tastes;  national,  regional or local economic  conditions;  demographic trends; traffic patterns;  the type, number and location of competing  restaurants;  and consumers'  discretionary  purchasing  power. We compete within each market with national and regional chains as well as locally-owned restaurants,  not only for customers but also for management and hourly  personnel and suitable real estate sites Restaurants also face growing  competition from the supermarket  industry, which offers  "convenient meals" in the form of improved entrees and side dishes from the deli section. We expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas.       Other factors  pertaining to our  competitive  position in the industry are addressed   under  the  sections   entitled   "Purchasing   and   Distribution," "Advertising   and   Marketing,"    "Management    Information    Systems"   and "Forward-Looking Statements" elsewhere in this report.  Trademarks and Related Agreements       We regard our  Darden  Restaurants(R),  Red  Lobster(R),  Olive  Garden(R), Bahama  Breeze(R),  Smokey  Bones(R) and Seasons 52SM service  marks,  and other variations  of these service  marks,  as having  significant  value and as being important in marketing the restaurants.  Our policy is to pursue registration of our  important  service  marks  and  trademarks  and to  oppose  vigorously  any infringement  of  them.  Generally,   with  appropriate  renewal  and  use,  the registration of our service marks will continue indefinitely.       Our only restaurant  operations outside of North America  historically have been  conducted  through an Area  Development  and Franchise  Agreement with Red Lobster  Japan  Co.,  Ltd.  (Red  Lobster  Japan),   an  unaffiliated   Japanese corporation.  Red Lobster Japan operated 33 Red Lobster  restaurants in Japan as of May 25, 2003. We do not have an ownership  interest in Red Lobster Japan, but receive royalty income under the Franchise Agreement.  The amount of this income is not material to our consolidated financial statements.  Seasonality       Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally.  During fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001,  our sales were highest in the spring,  lowest in the fall, and comparable during  winter  and  summer.  Holidays,   severe  weather,  storms  and  similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions.                                         9 Government Regulation       We are  subject to various  federal,  state and local  laws  affecting  our business.  Each of our restaurants  must comply with licensing  requirements and regulations  by a number of  governmental  authorities,  which  include  health, safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located.  The development  and operation of restaurants  depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use,  environmental, traffic and other regulations.  To date, we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals.       Presently  about 9.6 percent of our sales are  attributable  to the sale of alcoholic beverages.  Regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site (in most  cases,  on an annual  basis),  and  licenses  may be  revoked  or suspended  for cause at any time.  These  regulations  relate to many aspects of restaurant operation,  including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, and storage and dispensing of alcoholic  beverages.  The failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain  these  licenses  would  adversely  affect the  restaurant's operations. We also are subject in certain states to "dram-shop" statutes, which generally  provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment  that serves alcoholic  beverages to an intoxicated  person, who then causes injury to himself or a third  party.  We carry  liquor  liability  coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance.       We also are subject to federal and state  minimum  wage laws and other laws governing  such matters as overtime,  tip credits,  working  conditions,  safety standards,  and hiring and  employment  practices.  Changes in these laws during fiscal 2003 have not had a material effect on our operations.       We currently are operating under a Tip Rate Alternative Commitment ("TRAC") agreement with the Internal Revenue Service.  Through increased  educational and other efforts in the restaurants,  the TRAC agreement  reduces the likelihood of potential chain-wide employer-only FICA assessments for unreported tips.       We are subject to federal and state  environmental  regulations,  but these rules have not had a material  effect on our  operations.  During  fiscal  2003, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated.       Our  facilities  must  comply  with  the  applicable  requirements  of  the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA") and related state  accessibility statutes.  Under the ADA and related  state  laws,  we must  provide  equivalent service  to  disabled  persons,  and make  reasonable  accommodation  for  their employment,  and when constructing or undertaking  significant remodeling of our restaurants, we must make those facilities accessible.  Executive Officers       Our executive officers as of August 22, 2003 are:       Joe R. Lee, age 62, has been our Chief  Executive  Officer  since  December 1994 and  Chairman of the Board since April 1995.  Mr. Lee joined Red Lobster in 1967 as a member of its opening  management team, and was named its President in 1975. From 1970 to 1995, he held various  positions with General Mills,  Inc., a manufacturer  and  marketer of consumer  food  products  and our former  parent, including  Vice  Chairman,   with  responsibility  for  various  consumer  foods businesses and corporate staff functions,  Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Finance and International Restaurants.       Richard E.  Rivera,  age 56,  has been our  President  and Chief  Operating Officer since December 2002, our Vice Chairman from March 2002 to December 2002, and a Director since December  1997. He was our Executive  Vice  President,  and President of Red Lobster  Restaurants  from  December  1997 until March 2002. He served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Chart House Restaurants, Inc. from July 1997 until December 1997, as President and Chief Executive  Officer of RARE  Hospitality   International,   Inc.,  the  owner  of  LongHorn  Steakhouse restaurants,  from 1994 to 1997, and as President and Chief Executive Officer of TGI  Friday's,  Inc.  from 1988 to 1994.  He began his  career  with Steak & Ale Restaurants of America and has held various leadership positions in the industry over the last 25 years,  including  as a  Director  of the  National  Restaurant Association.                                         10 Blaine  Sweatt,  III,  age  55,  has  been  our  President,   New  Business Development  since February 1996 and Executive Vice President  since April 1995, and a Director since 1995. He led teams that developed the Olive Garden,  Bahama Breeze,  Smokey  Bones and  Seasons 52  concepts,  among  others.  He joined Red Lobster in 1976 and was named Director of New Restaurant Concept  Development in 1981. From 1986 to 1989, he held various  positions with General Mills,  Inc., a manufacturer and marketer of consumer food products and our former parent.       Laurie B. Burns,  age 41, has been our Senior Vice  President and President of Bahama Breeze since March 2003. She joined us in April 1999 as Vice President of  Development  for Red  Lobster,  and  served as our  Senior  Vice  President, Development  from September 2000 until March 2003.

Forward-Looking Statements       Certain information included in this report and other materials filed or to be filed by us with the Commission  (as well as information  included in oral or written  statements  made by us or on our behalf),  may contain  forward-looking statements about our future performance, plans and objectives,  long-term goals, forecasts of market trends and other matters.  These statements may be contained in our  filings  with the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  in our  press releases,  in other written  communications,  and in oral  statements made by or with the approval of one of our  authorized  officers.  Words or phrases such as "believe,"  "plan," "will likely result,"  "expect,"  "intend," "will continue," "is anticipated,"  "estimate," "project" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  These statements, and any other statements that are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as codified in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,  as  amended  from  time to time  (the  "Act").  These  forward-looking statements include,  but are not limited to, projections  regarding:  our growth plans and the number and type of new  restaurant  openings;  improved  financial performance  at Bahama  Breeze as a result of changing the  prototype  and other changes at that concept;  and our  expectation  to realize more of Smokey Bones' full  potential  as a result  of  changes  in the  location  of units  and other initiatives.       In connection  with the "safe harbor"  provisions of the Act, we are filing the following  cautionary  statements to identify important  factors,  risks and uncertainties  that could  cause our actual  results to differ  materially  from those  projected  in  forward-looking  statements  made by us, or on our behalf. These cautionary statements are to be used as a reference in connection with any forward-looking  statements.  The factors, risks and uncertainties identified in these  cautionary  statements  are in addition to those  contained  in any other cautionary statements, written or oral, which may be made or otherwise addressed in  connection  with a  forward-looking  statement  or  contained  in any of our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because of these factors,  risks and uncertainties,  we caution against placing undue reliance on forward-looking statements.  Although we believe that the assumptions underlying our forward-looking  statements are reasonable,  any of the assumptions could be incorrect,  and there can be no assurance  that the  forward-looking  statements will prove to be accurate.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. We do not  undertake any  obligation to modify or revise any  forward-looking  statement  to  take  into  account  or  otherwise  reflect subsequent   events,   or   circumstances   arising  after  the  date  that  the forward-looking statement was made.       The following  factors,  risks and  uncertainties,  have affected,  and may continue to affect,  our operating  results and the environment  within which we conduct our  business.  If our  projections  and estimates  regarding  these key factors differ  materially from what actually  occurs,  our actual results could vary  significantly  from  the  performance  projected  in  our  forward-looking statements.       Competition.  The  casual  dining  sector  of the  restaurant  industry  is intensely competitive in pricing,  service,  location,  personnel,  and type and quality of food.  We compete with  national,  regional  and local  organizations primarily  through the quality,  variety and value perception of menu items. The number  and  location  of  restaurants,   quality  and  efficiency  of  service, attractiveness  of facilities and  effectiveness  of  advertising  and marketing programs are also important factors. We anticipate that intense competition will continue in all of these areas.       Economic,  Market and Other  Conditions.  Certain  risks are endemic to the restaurant and retail  industry in general.  A protracted  economic  slowdown or worsening economy,  industry-wide cost pressures,  or weak consumer demand could lead to  same-restaurant  sales  declines and suppress sales growth and profits. The casual  dining sector of the  restaurant  industry is affected by changes in national,  regional  and  local  economic  conditions;  the  seasonality  of our business;  consumer  preferences,  including  changes in consumer tastes and the level of consumer  acceptance of                                         12 our  restaurant  concepts;  consumer  spending  patterns;   demographic  trends; weather;  traffic  patterns;  and the type,  number and  location  of  competing restaurants.  Our ability to undertake new  restaurant  development,  as well as improvements  and  additions  to existing  restaurants,  is affected by economic conditions, including interest rates, and government policies impacting land and construction costs and the cost and availability of borrowed funds.       Price and  Availability  of Food,  Labor,  Utilities,  Insurance and Media; Other  Costs.  Our  profitability   depends  significantly  on  our  ability  to anticipate and react to changes in the price and  availability  of food;  labor; utilities;  insurance  (including  workers'  compensation,   general  liability, health, and directors and officer's liability insurance); advertising, media and marketing;  employee  benefits;  and other  costs over which we may have  little control.  The price and  availability  of  commodities,  including,  among other things,  shrimp, lobster and other seafood, are subject to fluctuation and could increase or decrease more than we expect.  We are subject to the general risk of inflation, and possible shortages or interruptions in supply caused by inclement weather or other  conditions that could adversely  affect the  availability  and cost of the items we buy.  Restaurant  pre-opening  expenses  could be more than expected,  and labor shortages,  increased  employee turnover and higher minimum wage rates all could  raise our cost of doing  business.  Our  business  also is subject  to  the  risk  of  litigation  by  employees,   consumers,   suppliers, shareholders  or others  that may result in  additional  costs.  There can be no assurance  that  management  will be able to anticipate  and react to these cost issues  without a material  adverse effect on our  profitability  and results of operations.       Unfavorable Publicity Relating to Food Safety or Other Concerns. Multi-unit restaurant  businesses  can be adversely  affected by publicity  resulting  from complaints  or  litigation  alleging  poor  food  quality,  food-borne  illness, personal injury,  adverse health effects including obesity, or other operational concerns.  Negative  publicity may also result from actual or alleged violations of dram shop laws that may impose  liability  on sellers of liquors when a third party  is  injured  as a result  of  intoxication.  Regardless  of  whether  the allegations are valid,  unfavorable  publicity relating to just one or a limited number of restaurants  could taint public  perception of the entire brand.  Such unfavorable publicity and overall consumer perceptions of food safety could have a material adverse effect on our business.       Importance of Locations.  The success of our  restaurants  depends in large part on location. There can be no assurance that current locations will continue to  be  attractive,   as  demographic  patterns  change.  Possible  declines  in neighborhoods where restaurants are located, or economic conditions  surrounding those neighborhoods, could result in reduced sales in those locations.       Government  Regulation.  We are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business. The development and operation of restaurants depend to a  significant  extent on the selection and  acquisition  of suitable  sites, which  are  subject  to  zoning,  land  use,  environmental,  traffic  and other regulations.  Restaurant operations are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local departments relating to health,  liquor licenses,  sanitation and safety standards, federal and state labor laws (including applicable minimum wage  requirements,  overtime,  working and safety  conditions,  and citizenship requirements),  federal and state laws which prohibit  discrimination  and other laws  regulating the design and operation of  facilities,  such as the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. We cannot predict the effect on our operations of these laws and  regulations  or the future  enactment of additional  legislation regulating these and other areas.       Growth Plans. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our growth objectives or that new restaurants opened or acquired will be profitable. There are inherent  risks  involved with  expanding new concepts (such as Bahama Breeze and Smokey Bones) that have not yet proved their long-term viability. The opening and success of  restaurants  depends on various  factors,  including the identification  and availability of suitable and economically  viable locations; sales levels at existing  restaurants;  the  negotiation of acceptable  lease or purchase terms for new locations;  obtaining all required  governmental permits, including  zoning  approvals  and  liquor  licenses,  on a timely  basis;  other regulatory   compliance;   the   availability   of   necessary   contracts   and subcontractors  and the ability to meet construction  schedules;  our ability to manage union activities such as picketing,  which could delay construction;  the availability  of capital at affordable  cost to finance  growth;  changes in the weather  or other  acts of God that  could  result in  construction  delays  and adversely  affect the results of one or more  restaurants  for an  indeterminate amount of time; our ability to hire and train  qualified  management  personnel; and general economic and business conditions.                                         13 Item 2.  PROPERTIES       As of May 25,  2003,  we  operated  1,271  restaurants  (including  673 Red Lobster,  524 Olive Garden, 34 Bahama Breeze, 39 Smokey Bones and one Seasons 52 restaurants) and one Olive Garden Cafe in the following locations: Alabama (20)               Iowa (14)                 Nevada (11)               South Dakota (3)          Arizona (28)               Kansas (10)               New Hampshire (3)         Tennessee (29)          Arkansas (11)              Kentucky (14)             New Jersey (27)           Texas (106)          California (96)            Louisiana (8)             New Mexico (10)           Utah (12)          Colorado (27)              Maine (3)                 New York (50)             Vermont (1)          Connecticut (9)            Maryland (20)             North Carolina (27)       Virginia (42)          Delaware (4)               Massachusetts (8)         North Dakota (4)          Washington (24)          Florida (133)              Michigan (50)             Ohio (73)                 West Virginia (5)          Georgia (50)               Minnesota (22)            Oklahoma (17)             Wisconsin (19)          Hawaii (1)                 Mississippi (7)           Oregon (11)               Wyoming (2)          Idaho (6)                  Missouri (29)             Pennsylvania (62)         Canada (37)          Illinois (55)              Montana (2)               Rhode Island (2)          Indiana (42)               Nebraska (8)              South Carolina (18) Of our  1,271  restaurants  and the one Olive  Garden  Cafe open on May 25, 2003, 803 were located on owned sites and 469 were located on leased sites.  The 469 leases are classified as follows:           Land-Only Leases (we own buildings and equipment).................. 352          Ground and Building Leases...........................................59          Space/In-Line/Other Leases...........................................58                                                                             ----                   Total......................................................469                                                                              ===       During fiscal 1999, we formed two  subsidiary  corporations,  each of which elected to be taxed as a Real Estate  Investment  Trust  ("REIT") under Sections 856  through  860 of the  Internal  Revenue  Code.  These  elections  limit  the activities  of both  corporations  to holding  certain real estate  assets.  The formation of these two REITs is designed  primarily to assist us in managing our real  estate  portfolio  and  possibly  to provide a vehicle  to access  capital markets in the future.       Both REITs are  non-public  REITs.  Through our  subsidiary  companies,  we indirectly  own 100 percent of all voting stock and greater than 99.5 percent of the total value of each REIT. For financial reporting  purposes,  both REITs are included in our consolidated financial statements.       We own or  lease  our  executive  offices,  culinary  center  and  training facilities in Orlando,  Florida.  Except in limited  instances,  our  restaurant sites and other facilities are not subject to mortgages or encumbrances securing money  borrowed by us from outside  sources.  In our opinion,  our buildings and equipment  generally  are in good  condition,  suitable  for their  purposes and adequate for our current and foreseeable needs.       See also Note 4 "Land,  Buildings  and  Equipment"  and Note 10 "Leases" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 36 and 40, respectively,  of the  Company's  2003  Annual  Report  to  Shareholders,  incorporated  herein by reference.  Item 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS       From time to time, we are made a party to legal proceedings  arising in the ordinary  course of business.  We do not believe that the results of these legal proceedings, even if unfavorable to us, will have a materially adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Item 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS       Not applicable.                                         14 PART II  Item 5.
