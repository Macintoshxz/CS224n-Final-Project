BUSINESS Introduction Darden Restaurants, Inc. is the largest publicly held casual dining restaurant company in the world 1 , and served over 350million meals in fiscal 2007. As of May27, 2007, we operated through subsidiaries 1,397 restaurants in the United States and Canada. In the United States, we operated 1,362 restaurants in 49 states (the exception being Alaska), including 651 Red Lobster  , 608 Olive Garden  , 23 Bahama Breeze  , 73 Smokey Bones Barbeque& Grill  and seven Seasons 52  restaurants. In Canada, we operated 35 restaurants, including 29 Red Lobster and six Olive Garden restaurants. Through subsidiaries, we own and operate all of our restaurants in the United States and Canada. None of our restaurants in the U.S. or Canada are franchised. Of our 1,397 restaurants open on May27, 2007, 842 were located on owned sites and 555 were located on leased sites. In Japan, as of May31, 2007, we licensed 32 Red Lobster restaurants to an unaffiliated Japanese corporation that operates the restaurants under an Area Development and Franchise Agreement.
Darden Restaurants, Inc. is a Florida corporation incorporated in March 1995, and is the parent company of GMRI, Inc., also a Florida corporation. GMRI, Inc. and certain other of our subsidiaries own and operate our restaurants. GMRI, Inc. was originally incorporated in March 1968 as Red Lobster Inns of America, Inc. Our principal executive offices and restaurant support center are located at 5900 Lake Ellenor Drive, Orlando, Florida 32809, telephone (407)245-4000. Our corporate website address is www.darden.com . We make our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, and Section16 reports on Forms 3, 4 and 5, and all amendments to those reports available free of charge on our website the same day as the reports are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information on our website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to Darden, we, our or us include Darden Restaurants, Inc., GMRI, Inc. and our respective subsidiaries.
We have a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in May. Our 2007 fiscal year, which ended on May27, 2007, our 2006 fiscal year, which ended on May28, 2006, and our 2005 fiscal year, which ended on May29, 2005, each had 52 weeks.
The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with the information in our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations incorporated by reference in Item7 of this Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in Item8 of this Form 10-K.
Background We opened our first restaurant, a Red Lobster seafood restaurant, in Lakeland, Florida in 1968. Red Lobster was founded by William B. Darden, for whom we are named. We were acquired by General Mills, Inc. in 1970. In May 1995, we became a separate publicly held company when General Mills distributed all outstanding Darden stock to General Mills stockholders.
Red Lobster has grown from six restaurants in operation at the end of fiscal 1970 to 680 restaurants in North America by the end of fiscal 2007. Olive Garden, an internally developed Italian restaurant concept, opened its first restaurant in Orlando, Florida in fiscal 1983, and by the end of fiscal 2007 had expanded to 614 restaurants in North America. The number of Red Lobster and Olive Garden restaurants open at the end of fiscal 2007 decreased by two and increased by 32, respectively, as compared to the end of fiscal 2006.
Bahama Breeze is an internally developed concept that provides a Caribbean escape, offering the food, drinks and atmosphere you would find in the islands. In fiscal 1996, Bahama Breeze opened its first restaurant in Orlando, Florida. At the end of fiscal 2007, there were 23 Bahama Breeze restaurants.
1 Source: Nations Restaurant News, Special Report: Top 100,June25, 2007 (based on U.S. revenues from company-owned restaurants).
1 Table of Contents Seasons 52 is an internally developed concept that provides a casually sophisticated fresh grill and wine bar with seasonally inspired menus offering fresh ingredients to create great tasting meals that are lower in calories than comparable restaurant meals. Seasons 52 opened its first restaurant in Orlando, Florida in fiscal 2003. At the end of fiscal 2007, there were seven Seasons 52 restaurants.
The table below shows our growth and lists the number of restaurants operated by Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52 as of the end of each fiscal year since 1970. The final column in the table lists our total sales for the years indicated.

Does not include other restaurant concepts operated by us in these years that are no longer owned or operated by us. Also does not include restaurants that are included in discontinued operations, so the table excludes all Smokey Bones and Rocky River Grillhouse restaurants, including those still operating and held for sale, and the nine Bahama Breeze restaurants that were closed during fiscal 2007. See Restaurant Concepts  Continuing Operations  Bahama Breeze and Restaurant Concepts  Discontinued Operations  Smokey Bones.
2 Table of Contents (2) From fiscal 1996 forward, includes only net sales from continuing operations and excludes sales related to all Smokey Bones and Rocky River Grillhouse restaurants and nine Bahama Breeze restaurants closed during fiscal 2007 which are considered discontinued operations. Periods prior to fiscal 1996 include total sales from all of our operations, including sales from restaurant concepts besides Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52 that are no longer owned or operated by us. Total company sales from 1970 through fiscal 1995 were included in the consolidated operations of our former parent company, General Mills, Inc., prior to our spin-off as a separate publicly traded corporation in May 1995.
(3) Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00-14 Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives requires sales incentives to be classified as a reduction of sales. We adopted Issue 00-14 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. For purposes of this presentation, sales incentives have been reclassified as a reduction of sales for fiscal 1998 through 2007. Sales incentives for fiscal years prior to 1998 have not been reclassified.
Strategy The restaurant industry is generally considered to be comprised of four segments: quick service, midscale, casual dining and fine dining. The industry is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains. We believe that capable operators of strong multi-unit concepts have the opportunity to increase their share of the casual dining segment. We plan to grow by increasing the number of restaurants in each of our existing concepts other than Smokey Bones and by developing or acquiring additional concepts that can be expanded profitably. We have announced our intention to exit the Smokey Bones business. See Restaurant Concepts  Discontinued Operations  Smokey Bones.
While we are a leader in the casual dining segment, we know we cannot be successful without a clear sense of who we are. Our core purpose is To nourish and delight everyone we serve. This core purpose is supported by our core values:  Integrity and fairness;  Respect and caring;  Diversity;  Always learning/always teaching;  Being of service;  Teamwork; and  Excellence.
Our mission is to be The best in casual dining, now and for generations. We believe we can achieve this goal by continuing to build on our strategy to be a multi-brand casual dining growth company, which is grounded in our commitment to combining the following four strategic pillar areas:  Competitively superior leadership;  Brand management excellence;  Restaurant operating excellence; and  Restaurant support excellence.
Our strategic framework also includes two points that we believe separate us from our competition. We are committed to:  Being a multi-brand restaurant company that is bound together by common operating practices and a unifying culture which serves to make us stronger than the sum of our parts; and  Obtaining insights from our guests and employees to create powerful, broadly appealing brands and to develop successful people.
3 Table of Contents Restaurant Concepts  Continuing Operations Red Lobster Red Lobster is the largest casual dining, seafood-specialty restaurant operator in the United States. It offers an extensive menu featuring fresh fish, shrimp, crab, lobster, scallops and other seafood in a casual atmosphere. The menu includes a variety of specialty seafood and non-seafood entres, appetizers and desserts.
Most dinner menu entre prices range from $9.50 to $33.50, with certain lobster items available by the pound and seasonal/regional fresh fish selections available on a daily fresh fish menu. Most lunch menu entre prices range from $5.99 to $13.50. The price of most entres includes salad, side items and our signature Cheddar Bay biscuits. During fiscal 2007, the average check per person ranged from $17.50 to $18.50, with alcoholic beverages accounting for approximately 7.8 percent of Red Lobsters sales. Red Lobster maintains approximately 68 different menus across its trade areas to reflect geographic differences in consumer preferences, prices and selections, as well as a lower-priced childrens menu.
Olive Garden Olive Garden is the market share leader among casual dining Italian restaurants in the United States. Olive Gardens menu includes a variety of authentic Italian foods featuring fresh ingredients and a wine list that includes a broad selection of wines imported from Italy. The menu includes antipasti (appetizers); soups, salad and garlic breadsticks; baked pastas; sauted specialties with chicken, seafood and fresh vegetables; grilled meats; and a variety of desserts. Olive Garden also uses coffee imported from Italy for its espresso and cappuccino. Olive Garden is accelerating new restaurant growth and has introduced two new prototypes that are delivering the same guest experience while reducing capital investment and improving operating efficiencies.
Most dinner menu entre prices range from $8.50 to $19.95, and most lunch menu entre prices range from $5.95 to $10.25. The price of each entre also includes as much fresh salad or soup and breadsticks as a guest desires. During fiscal 2007, the average check per person ranged from $14.50 to $15.50, with alcoholic beverages accounting for approximately 8.1 percent of Olive Gardens sales. Olive Garden maintains approximately 35 different dinner menus and 28 lunch menus across its trade areas to reflect geographic differences in consumer preferences, prices and selections, as well as nine childrens menus.
Bahama Breeze Bahama Breeze restaurants bring guests the feeling of a Caribbean escape, offering food, drinks and atmosphere you would find in the islands. The menu features distinctive, Caribbean-inspired fresh seafood, chicken and steaks as well as signature specialty drinks. The first Bahama Breeze opened in 1996 and met with strong positive consumer response. We continued to test the concept by opening a limited number of additional restaurants in each of the following years, and began national expansion of the concept in 1998. While the concept continued to be well received by guests, its financial performance did not meet our overall expectations, and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 Bahama Breeze closed six restaurants and wrote down the carrying value of four others. This action reduced the total number of restaurants in operation to 32, and all new restaurant expansion was postponed.
Since fiscal 2004, Bahama Breeze has implemented changes to become a more relevant brand for its guests, evolving its menu to make it more approachable yet still distinctive and improving the guest experience while lowering its operating costs. Bahama Breeze will continue to seek to achieve its strong potential by elevating the guest experience to be competitively superior and by improving restaurant-level returns through changes to its operations that remove costs and complexity that do not add value for its guests. In fiscal 2007, Bahama Breeze wrote down the carrying value of five restaurants and closed nine, but improved the guest experience and unit economics sufficiently at the remaining restaurants that we now expect to restart modest unit growth in fiscal 2009. The results of operations of these nine closed restaurants are reported as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Most dinner menu entre prices at Bahama Breeze range from $9.00 to $22.00, and most lunch entre prices range from $7.00 to $14.00. During fiscal 2007, the average check per person ranged from $22.00 to $23.00, 4 Table of Contents with alcoholic beverages accounting for approximately 23.8 percent of Bahama Breezes sales. Bahama Breeze maintains 11 different lunch and dinner menus to reflect geographic differences in consumer preferences, prices and selections, as well as two childrens menus.
Seasons 52 Seasons 52 is a casually sophisticated fresh grill and wine bar with seasonally inspired menus offering fresh ingredients to create great tasting meals that are lower in calories than comparable restaurant meals. It offers an international wine list of more than 140 wines, with 70 available by the glass. The first Seasons 52 opened in 2003, and we continued to test the concept by opening a limited number of additional restaurants in each of the following years. Seasons 52 plans to continue operating its seven existing restaurants and open approximately two new restaurants in fiscal 2009.
Restaurant Concepts  Discontinued Operations Smokey Bones Smokey Bones features barbequed pork, beef and chicken, as well as other grilled favorites, all served in a lively yet comfortable mountain-lodge setting that features televised sports. We opened the first Smokey Bones in September 1999, and began national expansion of the concept in fiscal 2002. Softening of sales at Smokey Bones led us to reevaluate our new restaurant opening strategy and test a new direction for the business. In fiscal 2007, we opened a new repositioned Smokey Bones restaurant named Rocky River Grillhouse, and a second Rocky River Grillhouse from a converted Smokey Bones. However, the Smokey Bones concept and related business model was designed to be a nationally advertised brand, and since it was not on a path to achieving that vision, we concluded it was not a meaningful growth vehicle for Darden. Therefore, on May5, 2007 we announced the closure of 54 Smokey Bones and both Rocky River Grillhouse restaurants, indicated our intention to operate the remaining 73 Smokey Bones restaurants while seeking a buyer, and incurred non-cash impairment charges and other costs relating to these actions. The results of operations for these restaurants are treated as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Recent and Planned Growth  Continuing Operations During fiscal 2007, as discussed above, we closed nine Bahama Breeze, 54 Smokey Bones and two Rocky River Grillhouse restaurants that are treated as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. On a continuing operations basis, during fiscal 2007, we opened 38 new restaurants (excluding the relocation of existing restaurants to new sites and the rebuilding of restaurants at existing sites) and permanently closed 7 restaurants. In addition, we had one restaurant closed temporarily at the end of fiscal 2007, which we expect to reopen during fiscal 2008. Including the fiscal 2007 re-opening of two rebuilt restaurants closed in fiscal 2006, we had a net increase of 32 restaurants in fiscal 2007 (or a net decrease of 34 restaurants in fiscal 2007 including discontinued operations). We plan to open approximately 41-48 new Red Lobster and Olive Garden restaurants during fiscal 2008 (excluding relocations and rebuilds). Our actual and projected new openings from continuing operations by concept (excluding relocations and rebuilds) are shown below.

Our objective is to continue to expand Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52, and to develop or acquire additional concepts that can be expanded profitably. We have continued to test new ideas and concepts, and also to evaluate potential acquisition candidates to assess whether they would satisfy our strategic and financial objectives.
5 Table of Contents We consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurants long-term success, and we devote significant effort to the site selection process. Prior to entering a market, we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants. Our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors. These factors include trade area demographics, such as target population density and household income levels; competitive influences in the trade area; the sites visibility, accessibility and traffic volume; and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls, hotel/motel complexes, offices and universities. Members of senior management evaluate, inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition. Constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after permits are obtained and the site is acquired.
The following table illustrates the approximate average capital investment, size and dining capacity of the four Red Lobster restaurants opened during fiscal 2007 (consisting of three new restaurants and one relocation) and the 32 Olive Garden restaurants that were opened during fiscal 2007 (excluding one in-line restaurant opened in fiscal 2007).

(2) Includes all space under the roof, including the coolers and freezers, but excludes gazebos, pavilions and porte cocheres.
(3) Includes bar dining seats and patio seating, but excludes bar stools.
(4) Includes patio dining tables.
We systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards. When a restaurant falls below minimum standards, we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes, and implement marketing and operational plans to improve that restaurants performance. If performance does not improve to acceptable levels, the restaurant is evaluated for relocation, closing or conversion to one of our other concepts.
During fiscal 2007, in addition to the actions taken with respect to Smokey Bones and Rocky River Grillhouse in May 2007 discussed above, we permanently closed five and relocated one Red Lobster restaurant, permanently closed two Olive Garden restaurants, and permanently closed nine Bahama Breeze restaurants.
Restaurant Operations We believe that high-quality restaurant management is critical to our long-term success. We also believe that our leadership position, strong success-oriented culture and various short-term and long-term incentive programs, including stock units, help attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers.
Our restaurant management structure varies by concept and restaurant size. Each restaurant is led by a general manager and three to five additional managers, depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant. Each restaurant also employs approximately 50-185 hourly employees, most of whom work part-time. We issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations, as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes. The restaurant management teams are responsible for the day-to-day operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards. At our two largest concepts, Red Lobster and Olive Garden, restaurant general managers report to directors. At Red Lobster and Olive Garden, each director was responsible for six to 10 restaurants at the end of fiscal 2007, which is our target range for each director at established concepts. Restaurants are visited regularly by all levels of supervision to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards.
6 Table of Contents Each concepts vice president or director of training, together with senior operations executives, are responsible for developing and maintaining that concepts operations training programs. These efforts include a 12 to 15-week training program for management trainees, and continuing development programs for managers, supervisors and directors. The emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant concept, but includes leadership, restaurant business management and culinary skills. We also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants, including deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations. The opening training teams typically begin work one week prior to opening and remain at the new restaurant up to three weeks after the opening. They are re-deployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurants operating staff.
Quality Assurance Our Total Quality Department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe, high-quality food in a clean and safe environment. Through rigorous physical evaluation and testing at our North American laboratories and through point source inspection by our international team of Quality Specialists in several foreign countries, we purchase only seafood that meets or exceeds our specifications. We use independent third parties to inspect and evaluate commodity vendors. In addition, any commodity supplier that produces a high risk product is subject to a food safety evaluation by Darden personnel at least annually. We require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) food safety programs adopted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in place. The HACCP programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause food-borne illnesses by applying scientifically-based controls to analyze hazards, identify and monitor critical control points, and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met. Since 1976, we have required routine microbiological testing of seafood and other commodities for quality and microbiological safety. In addition, our total quality managers and third party auditors visit each restaurant periodically throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation. The total quality managers also serve as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety.
Purchasing and Distribution Our ability to ensure a consistent supply of high-quality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant concepts depends on reliable sources of procurement from reliable sources. Our purchasing staff sources, negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 2,000 suppliers in more than 30 countries. Suppliers must meet strict quality control standards in the development, harvest, catch and production of food products. Competitive bids, long-term contracts and long-term vendor relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products.
We believe that our seafood purchasing capabilities are a significant competitive advantage. Our purchasing staff travels routinely within the United States and internationally to source more than 100 varieties of top-quality seafood at competitive prices. We believe that we have established excellent long-term relationships with key seafood vendors, and usually source our product directly from producers (not brokers or middlemen). We operate procurement offices in Singapore and Toronto, our only purchasing offices outside of Orlando, to source products directly from Asia and Canada. While the supply of certain seafood species is volatile, we believe we have the ability to identify alternative seafood products and to adjust our menus as necessary. All other essential food products are available, or can be made available upon short notice, from alternative qualified suppliers. Because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products, inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales. Controlled inventories of specified products are distributed to restaurants through independent national distribution companies. In addition, through strategic alliances between Darden Direct Distribution, Inc. and these distribution companies, we maintain inventory ownership and operations dedication in select environments enhancing our supply chains competitive advantage.
Our supplier diversity program is an integral part of our purchasing efforts. Through this program, we identify minority and women-owned vendors and assist them in establishing supplier relationships with us. We are committed to the development and growth of minority and women-owned enterprises, and in fiscal 2007 we spent approximately 8.4 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively, of our purchasing dollars with those firms.
7 Table of Contents We continue to invest in new technologies to improve our purchasing and restaurant operations. We are in the process of implementing iKitchen, a web-based software system, at all of our restaurants. The system is designed to more efficiently handle restaurant product orders, receiving, invoice approval and inventories.
Advertising and Marketing We believe we have developed significant marketing and advertising capabilities. Our size enables us to be a leading advertiser in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry. Red Lobster and Olive Garden leverage the efficiency of national network television advertising and supplement it with local television advertising. Bahama Breeze and Smokey Bones do not use national television advertising. Our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to attract customers. We implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase our sales and profits. We also rely on outdoor billboard and direct mail advertising, as well as radio, newspaper and direct mail coupon programs, as appropriate, to attract customers. We have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor customer satisfaction and evolving expectations.
Employees At the end of fiscal 2007, we employed approximately 157,000 persons. Of these employees, approximately 1,300 were corporate or restaurant concept personnel located in our restaurant support center in Orlando, Florida, approximately 6,300 were restaurant management personnel in the restaurants or in field offices, and the remainder were hourly restaurant personnel. Of the restaurant support center employees, approximately 60 percent were management personnel and the balance were administrative or office employees. Our operating executives have an average of more than 14 years of experience with us. The restaurant general managers average 12 years with us. We believe that we provide working conditions and compensation that compare favorably with those of our competitors. Most employees, other than restaurant management and corporate management, are paid on an hourly basis. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Information Technology We strive for leadership in the restaurant business by using technology as a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy. Since 1975, computers located in the restaurants have been used to assist in the management of the restaurants. We have implemented systems targeted at improved financial control, cost management, enhanced guest service and improved employee effectiveness. Management information systems are designed to be used across restaurant concepts, yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant concept. Several years ago, we implemented a suite of web-enabled and fully integrated financial and human resource (including payroll and benefits) systems. We also implemented a high-speed data network connecting all restaurants to all current and anticipated future applications. In the past year, we continued the implementation of DASH, a next generation technology platform for our restaurant point of sale system. We expect to deploy the new platform, including new hardware and software, to all restaurant concepts over the next year. In the past year, we piloted and began deploying a meal pacing system in Olive Garden and Red Lobster. The new meal pacing system is designed to properly pace the preparation of menu items, based on cook-times, to enhance the guests experience and enhance restaurant capacity by increasing table turns. We anticipate that this system will be fully deployed in Olive Garden and Red Lobster by the end of fiscal 2008. We are also in the process of implementing iKitchen, a web-based software system designed to more efficiently handle restaurant product orders and other related matters, as discussed above under Purchasing and Distribution.
Restaurant hardware and software support is provided or coordinated from the restaurant support center in Orlando, Florida, seven days a week, 24 hours a day. A communications network sends and receives critical business data to and from the restaurants throughout the day and night, providing timely and extensive information on business activity in every location. The restaurant support center houses our data center, which contains sufficient computing power to process information from all restaurants quickly and efficiently. Our information is processed in a secure environment to protect both the actual data and the physical assets. We guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan, which includes storing critical business information off-site, testing the disaster recovery plan at a host-site facility and providing on-site power backup via a large diesel generator. We use internally developed proprietary software, as well as purchased software, with proven, non-proprietary hardware. This allows processing power to be distributed effectively to each of our restaurants.
8 Table of Contents Our management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates will position us well to support current needs and future growth. We are committed to maintaining an industry leadership position in information systems and computing technology. We use a strategic information systems planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning. Information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic, financial, regulatory and other business advantage criteria.
Competition The restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food, price, service, restaurant location, personnel, concept, attractiveness of facilities, and effectiveness of advertising and marketing. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing restaurants; and consumers discretionary purchasing power. We compete within each market with national and regional chains and locally-owned restaurants for customers, management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites. We also face growing competition from the supermarket industry, which offers convenient meals in the form of improved entres and side dishes from the deli section. We expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas.
Other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled Purchasing and Distribution, Advertising and Marketing, Information Technology and Risk Factors elsewhere in this report.
Trademarks and Related Agreements We regard our Darden Restaurants  , Red Lobster  , Olive Garden  , Bahama Breeze  , Smokey Bones Barbeque& Grill  and Seasons 52  service marks, and other service marks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and as being important to our marketing efforts. Our policy is to pursue registration of our important service marks and trademarks and to oppose vigorously any infringement of them. Generally, with appropriate renewal and use, the registration of our service marks will continue indefinitely.
Our only restaurant operations outside of North America are conducted through an Area Development and Franchise Agreement with REINS International, Inc. (REINS), an unaffiliated Japanese corporation. REINS operated 43 Red Lobster restaurants in Japan as of May27, 2007. On May31, 2007, 11 restaurants operated by REINS were closed. We do not have an ownership interest in REINS, but we receive royalty income under the Franchise Agreement. The amount of this income is not material to our consolidated financial statements.
Seasonality Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally. During fiscal 2005 through 2007, our sales were highest in the spring and winter, followed by summer, and lowest in the fall. During fiscal 2004, our sales were highest in the spring, lowest in the fall, and comparable during winter and summer. Holidays, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions.
Government Regulation We are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business. Each of our restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. The development and operation of restaurants depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations. To date, we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals.
During fiscal 2007, approximately 8.7 percent of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages. Regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site (in most cases, on an annual basis), and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. These regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant 9 Table of Contents operation, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. The failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these licenses would adversely affect the restaurants operations. We also are subject in certain states to dram-shop statutes, which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person, who then causes injury to himself or a third party. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance.
We also are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws governing such matters as overtime, tip credits, working conditions, safety standards, and hiring and employment practices. Changes in these laws during fiscal 2007 have not had a material effect on our operations.
We currently are operating under a Tip Rate Alternative Commitment (TRAC) agreement with the Internal Revenue Service. Through increased educational and other efforts in the restaurants, the TRAC agreement reduces the likelihood of potential chain-wide employer-only FICA assessments for unreported tips.
We are subject to federal and state environmental regulations, but these rules have not had a material effect on our operations. During fiscal 2007, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated.
Our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and related state accessibility statutes. Under the ADA and related state laws, we must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment, and when constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of our restaurants, we must make those facilities accessible.

Item1A.
RISK FACTORS Various risks and uncertainties could affect our business. Any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. It is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. Therefore, the following is not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.
We face intense competition, and if we are unable to continue to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
The casual dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing, service, location, personnel and type and quality of food, and there are many well-established competitors. We compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locally-owned restaurants. We also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services, particularly in the supermarket industry which offers convenient meals in the form of improved entres and side dishes from the deli section. We compete primarily on the quality, variety and value perception of menu items. The number and location of restaurants, type of concept, quality and efficiency of service, attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors. We anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors. If we are unable to continue to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
Certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and certain general economic factors including energy prices and interest rates that are largely out of our control may adversely affect our results of operations.
Our business results depend on a number of industry-specific and general economic factors, many of which are beyond our control. The casual dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in national, regional and local economic conditions, seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes, consumer preferences, including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant concepts, and consumer spending patterns. The performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends, severe weather including hurricanes, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants.
12 Table of Contents In addition, general economic conditions may adversely affect our results of operations. Recessionary economic cycles, a protracted economic slowdown, a worsening economy, increased energy prices, rising interest rates or other industry-wide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings. When gasoline, natural gas, electricity and other energy costs increase, and credit card, home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates, our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine out, or may choose more inexpensive restaurants when eating outside the home. Furthermore, we cannot predict the effects of actual or threatened armed conflicts or terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, military action against any foreign state or group located in a foreign state or heightened security requirements on the economy or consumer confidence in the United States. Any of these events could also affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures.
Unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our customers could increase our costs, reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing, any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations.
The price and availability of food, ingredients and utilities used by our restaurants could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.
Our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food, ingredients, utilities and other related costs over which we may have little control. Operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities, including shrimp, lobster, crab and other seafood, as well as beef, pork, chicken, cheese and produce. The introduction of or changes to tariffs on imported shrimp or other food products could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products. We are subject to the general risks of inflation. In addition, possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items caused by inclement weather or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of the items we buy. Our restaurants operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as electricity and natural gas, whether as a result of inflation or otherwise, on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply. Our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations.
We may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs.
Our restaurant operations are subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working conditions, overtime and tip credits. As federal and state minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage. Labor shortages and increased employee turnover could also increase our labor costs. If competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our profitability may decline. In addition, the current premiums that we pay for our insurance (including workers compensation, general liability, property, health, and directors and officers liability) may increase at any time, thereby further increasing our costs. The dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers compensation and general liability insurance, for which we carry high per-claim deductibles, may also increase at any time, thereby further increasing our costs. Further, the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses.
Increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our results of operations.
If our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions, if our advertising, media or marketing expenses increase, or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than that of our competitors, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
We may experience higher-than-anticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing, relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
Our revenues and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing, relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants. We incur substantial pre-opening 13 Table of Contents expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close, relocate or remodel existing restaurants. The expenses of opening, closing, relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated. An increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
Litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, consumers, suppliers, shareholders or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of our services, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Unfavorable publicity could harm our business.
Multi-unit restaurant businesses such as ours can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from complaints or litigation alleging poor food quality, food-borne illness, personal injury, adverse health effects (including obesity) or other concerns. Negative publicity may also result from actual or alleged violations by our restaurants of dram shop laws which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or to a third party. Regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid, unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants, or only to a single restaurant, could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand. Adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of food safety could have a material adverse effect on our business.
A lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.
The success of our restaurants depends in large part on their location. As demographic and economic patterns change, current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable. Possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced revenues in those locations. In addition, desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation. The occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.
We are subject to a number of risks relating to federal, state and local regulation of our business that may increase our costs and decrease our profit margins.
The restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those relating to building and zoning requirements and those relating to the preparation and sale of food. The development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements. We are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health, sanitation, safety and fire standards and liquor licenses, federal and state laws governing our relationships with employees (including the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and applicable requirements concerning the minimum wage, overtime, family leave, tip credits, working conditions, safety standards and immigration status), federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. In addition, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission, and disposal of hazardous materials. The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability.
14 Table of Contents Our growth through the opening of new restaurants and the development or acquisition of new dining concepts may not be successful and could result in poor financial performance.
As part of our business strategy, we intend to continue to expand our current portfolio of restaurant concepts and to develop or acquire additional concepts that can be expanded profitably. This strategy involves numerous risks, and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives. We may not be able to open all of our planned new restaurants, and the new restaurants that we open may not be profitable or as profitable as our existing restaurants. New restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize, and even sales at successful newly-opened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation. The opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on sales levels at existing restaurants. Furthermore, we may not be able to develop or acquire additional concepts that are as profitable as our existing restaurants. Growth through acquisitions may involve additional risks. For example, we may pay too much for a concept relative to the actual economic return, be required to borrow funds to make our acquisition (which would increase our interest expense) or be unable to integrate an acquired concept into our operations.
The ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks, such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations, the need to obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals and liquor licenses) on a timely basis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors, the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets, the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay construction, increases in labor and building material costs, the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time, our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions. At each potential location, we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites, construction contractors, management personnel, hourly employees and other resources. If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues and earnings in future periods.
Our plans to expand our newer concepts Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52 that have not yet proven their long-term viability may not be successful, which could require us to make substantial further investments in those concepts and result in further losses and impairments.
While each of our restaurant concepts, as well as each of our individual restaurants, are subject to the risks and uncertainties described above, there is an enhanced level of risk and uncertainty related to the operation and expansion of our newer concepts such as Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52. These concepts have not yet proven their long-term viability or growth potential. We have made substantial investments in the development and expansion of each of these concepts, and further investment is required. While we have implemented a number of changes to operations at Bahama Breeze, and believe we have improved the guest experience and unit economics sufficiently to restart modest unit growth in fiscal 2009, there can be no assurance that these changes will continue to be successful or that new unit growth will occur. Seasons 52 also is in the very early stages of its development and will require additional resources to support further growth. In each case, these brands will continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties that accompany any emerging restaurant concept.
Our efforts to sell our Smokey Bones restaurants may not be successful, or the restaurants may be sold for less than is expected, which could result in further losses and impairments.
On May5, 2007, we closed 54 Smokey Bones and two Rocky River Grillhouse restaurants, indicated our intention to operate the remaining 73 Smokey Bones while seeking a buyer, and incurred non-cash impairment charges relating to these actions. We will attempt to sell the closed Smokey Bones restaurants that are owned and not leased, but there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. We intend to offer the remaining operating Smokey Bones restaurants and related assets for sale, but there can be no assurances that we will identify an acceptable buyer or negotiate 15 Table of Contents acceptable terms of sale. If our operating Smokey Bones restaurants are not sold, we may continue to operate or close them, either of which could result in further losses and impairment charges. Even if our Smokey Bones restaurants, whether operating or closed, are sold, the purchase price could be lower than expected, also resulting in further losses and impairments.

As of May27, 2007, we continued to operate 73 Smokey Bones restaurants in the following locations while seeking a buyer, and all of these restaurants are reported as a component of discontinued operations: Connecticut (1) Kentucky (3) North Carolina (3) Tennessee (2) Florida (19) Maryland (1) Ohio (11) Virginia (6) Georgia (4) Massachusetts (3) Pennsylvania (8) Illinois (2) Michigan (2) Rhode Island (1) Indiana (2) New York (4) South Carolina (1) Of our 73 Smokey Bones restaurants open on May27, 2007, 39 were located on owned sites and 34 were located on leased sites.
16 Table of Contents Properties  General During fiscal 1999, we formed two subsidiary corporations, each of which elected to be taxed as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. These elections limit the activities of both corporations to holding certain real estate assets. The formation of these two REITs is designed primarily to assist us in managing our real estate portfolio and possibly to provide a vehicle to access capital markets in the future.
Both REITs are non-public REITs. Through our subsidiary companies, we indirectly own 100 percent of all voting stock and greater than 99.5 percent of the total value of each REIT. For financial reporting purposes, both REITs are included in our consolidated financial statements.
All of the buildings that make up our executive offices, culinary center, training facilities and supporting warehouses in Orange County (Orlando metro area), Florida, are currently leased. On June20, 2006, we entered into an agreement to sell and lease back the 10 buildings that we previously owned. The sale and the commencement of our leases for those buildings occurred in August 2006. The initial term of the leases is three years, and we have two one-year renewal options.
We have purchased several adjacent parcels of vacant land in Orange County, Florida, and have begun planning to relocate our headquarters to this site. We expect our proposed Restaurant Support Center campus at this new location to offer a more collaborative and unified environment with additional room for future growth. We anticipate that it will take three or more years to design and build the new Restaurant Support Center campus. We currently project completing the first phase of this development during fiscal 2010.
Except in limited instances, our present restaurant sites and other facilities are not subject to mortgages or encumbrances securing money borrowed by us from outside sources. In our opinion, our current buildings and equipment generally are in good condition, suitable for their purposes and adequate for our current needs. See also Note 5 Land, Buildings and Equipment, Net and Note 13 Leases under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, incorporated herein by reference.
Item3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are subject to private lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. A number of these lawsuits, proceedings and claims may exist at any given time. These matters typically involve claims from guests, employees and others related to operational issues common to the restaurant industry, and can also involve infringement of, or challenges to, our trademarks. While the resolution of a lawsuit, proceeding or claim may have an impact on our financial results for the period in which it is resolved, we believe that the final disposition of the lawsuits, proceedings and claims in which we are currently involved, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The following is a brief description of the more significant of these matters. In view of the inherent uncertainties of litigation, the outcome of any unresolved matter described below cannot be predicted at this time, nor can the amount of any potential loss be reasonably estimated.
Like other restaurant companies and retail employers, we have been faced in a few states with allegations of purported class-wide wage and hour violations. In August 2003, three former employees in Washington filed a purported class action in Washington State Superior Court in Spokane County alleging violations of Washington labor laws with respect to providing rest breaks. The Court stayed the action and ordered the plaintiffs into our mandatory arbitration program. Although we believe we provided the required rest breaks to our employees, we resolved the case through mediation, and the settlement agreement received preliminary court approval in June 2007.
In January 2004, a former food server filed a purported class action in California state court alleging that Red Lobsters server banking policies and practices (under which servers settle guest checks directly with customers throughout their shifts, and turn in collected monies at the shifts end) improperly required her and other food servers and bartenders to make up cash shortages and walkouts in violation of California law. The case was ordered to arbitration. As a procedural matter, the arbitrator ruled that class-wide arbitration is permissible under our dispute resolution program. We have filed a petition opposing the arbitrators decision; no decision on the petition has yet been rendered and no class has been certified. In January 2007, plaintiffs counsel filed in California state court a second purported class action lawsuit on behalf of servers and bartenders alleging that Olive Gardens server banking policy and its alleged failure to pay split shift premiums violated California law. We believe that our policies and practices were lawful and that we have strong defenses to both cases.
17 Table of Contents On March23, 2006, we were notified that the staff of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was conducting an inquiry into the marketing of our gift cards. During the inquiry, we cooperated with the staff, provided information and made some voluntary adjustments to the disclosure of dormancy fees related to our gift cards. In October 2006, we discontinued the imposition of dormancy fees. In April 2007, without admitting liability, we entered into a consent order with the FTC under which we agreed to make certain minimum disclosures should we decide in the future to impose fees in connection with our gift cards, to maintain certain records related to gift cards, and to restore dormancy fees previously imposed on the cards. By its terms the consent order will remain in place until 2027.
