PART I Item 1.  BUSINESS  Introduction       Darden  Restaurants,  Inc.  is the  largest  publicly  held  casual  dining restaurant  company in the  world,1 and served  over 300  million  meals  during fiscal 2004. As of May 30, 2004,  we operated  1,325  restaurants  in the United States and Canada.  In the United States,  we operated  1,288  restaurants in 49 states (the exception  being Alaska),  including 649 Red  Lobster(R),  537 Olive Garden(R),  32 Bahama  Breeze(R),  69 Smokey  Bones  Barbeque & Grill SM and one Seasons 52SM restaurants.  In Canada,  we operated 37 restaurants,  including 31 Red  Lobster  and six Olive  Garden  restaurants.  We own and operate all of our restaurants in the United States and Canada,  with no franchising.  Of our 1,325 restaurants  open on May 30, 2004,  816 were located on owned sites and 509 were located on leased sites. In Japan, we licensed 38 Red Lobster  restaurants to an unaffiliated  Japanese  corporation that operates the restaurants  under an Area Development and Franchise Agreement.       Darden  Restaurants,  Inc. is a Florida  corporation  incorporated in March 1995, and is the parent company of GMRI, Inc., also a Florida corporation.  GMRI and our other subsidiaries own the operating assets of the restaurants. GMRI was originally  incorporated in March 1968 as Red Lobster Inns of America,  Inc. Our principal  executive  offices and restaurant  support center are located at 5900 Lake Ellenor  Drive,  Orlando,  Florida 32809,  telephone  (407)  245-4000.  Our corporate website address is www.darden.com.  We make our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, and Section 16 reports on Forms 3, 4 and 5, and all  amendments to those  reports  available  free of  charge  on our  website  the same day as the reports are filed with or furnished to the Securities  and Exchange  Commission. Information  on our website is not deemed to be  incorporated  by reference into this Form 10-K.  Unless the  context  indicates  otherwise,  all  references  to Darden,   "we",   "our"  or  "us"  include  Darden,   GMRI  and  our  respective subsidiaries.       We have a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in May. Our 2004 fiscal year ended on May 30,  2004 and had 53 weeks.  Our 2003 fiscal year ended on May 25, 2003, and our 2002 fiscal year ended on May 26, 2002, and each had 52 weeks.       The following  description  of our business  should be read in  conjunction with the  information in our  Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  incorporated by reference in Item 7 of this Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  Background       We opened our first  restaurant,  a Red Lobster,  in  Lakeland,  Florida in 1968.  Red Lobster was founded by William B. Darden,  for whom we are named.  We were acquired by General Mills,  Inc. in 1970. In May 1995, we became a separate publicly  held company when General Mills  distributed  all  outstanding  Darden stock to General Mills' stockholders.       The number of Red Lobster and Olive Garden  restaurants  open at the end of fiscal 2004 increased by seven and 19,  respectively,  as compared to the end of fiscal 2003. Red Lobster has grown from six  restaurants in operation at the end of fiscal 1970 to 680 units in North  America by the end of fiscal  2004.  Olive Garden, an internally developed concept, opened its first restaurant in Orlando, Florida  in fiscal  1983,  and by the end of  fiscal  2004 had  expanded  to 543 restaurants in North America.       Bahama Breeze is an internally developed concept with a Caribbean theme. In fiscal 1996, Bahama Breeze opened its first restaurant in Orlando,  Florida.  At the end of fiscal 2004, there were 32 Bahama Breeze restaurants.  -----------------------------  1 Source:  Nation's  Restaurant News,  "Special Report:  Top 100," June 28, 2004 (based on revenues from company-owned restaurants).                                         2 Smokey Bones is also an internally developed concept featuring barbeque and other  grilled  favorites  served in an  inviting  mountain-lodge  setting  that features  televised  sports.  The first  restaurant was opened in fiscal 2000 in Orlando,  Florida.  At the  end of  fiscal  2004,  there  were 69  Smokey  Bones restaurants.       In February  2003,  we opened a new test  restaurant  in  Orlando,  Florida called Seasons 52. It is a casually  sophisticated fresh grill and wine bar with seasonally  inspired menus  offering fresh  ingredients to create great tasting, nutritionally  balanced  meals  that  are  lower  in  calories  than  comparable restaurant meals.       The table  below  shows our  growth  and  lists the  number of  restaurants operated by Red Lobster,  Olive Garden,  Bahama Breeze, Smokey Bones and Seasons 52 as of the end of each fiscal year since 1970.  The final  column in the table lists our total sales for the years indicated.

(3)  Emerging  Issues  Task Force  Issue 00-14  "Accounting  for  Certain  Sales      Incentives"  requires  sales  incentives to be classified as a reduction of      sales.  We adopted  Issue 00-14 in the fourth  quarter of fiscal 2002.  For      purposes of this presentation, sales incentives have been reclassified as a      reduction  of sales for fiscal 1998  through  2004.  Sales  incentives  for      fiscal years prior to 1998 have not been reclassified.
Strategy       The  restaurant  industry is generally  considered  to be comprised of four segments: quick service,  midscale,  casual dining and fine dining. The industry is highly  fragmented and includes many independent  operators and small chains. We  believe  that  capable  operators  of strong  multi-unit  concepts  have the opportunity  to increase  their share of the casual dining  segment.  We plan to grow by increasing the number of  restaurants  in each of our existing  concepts and by  developing  or  acquiring  additional  concepts  that  can  be  expanded profitably.       While we are a leader in the casual  dining  segment,  we know we cannot be successful  without a clear sense of who we are. Our core purpose is "To nourish and  delight  everyone we serve."  This core  purpose is  supported  by our core values:            o    Integrity and fairness;           o    Respect and caring;           o    Diversity;           o    Always learning/always teaching;           o    Being "of service";           o    Teamwork; and           o    Excellence.       Our mission is to be "The best in casual dining,  now and for generations." Four strategic imperatives support our mission:            o    Leadership excellence at all levels;           o    Brand building excellence;           o    Service and hospitality excellence; and           o    Culinary and beverage excellence.       We also have two  strategic  enablers  we  believe  can help us  accelerate progress in each strategic imperative. These enablers are:            o    Diversity   excellence   that   embraces   and  builds  upon  our                differences; and           o    Process and technology  excellence  that maximize  organizational                effectiveness and drive both discipline and nimbleness.       New to our strategic framework is the explicit statement of two points that have been  implicit in our approach to the business for many years now, and that we believe separate us from our competition. We are committed to:            o    Being a multi-brand  restaurant company that is bound together by                common operating practices and a unifying culture which serves to                make us stronger than the sum of our parts; and           o    Listening  to our guests and  employees  for  insights we need to                create  powerful,   broadly   appealing  brands  and  to  develop                successful people.                                         4 Restaurant Concepts  Red Lobster       Red  Lobster is the largest  casual  dining,  seafood-specialty  restaurant operator in the United States. It offers an extensive menu featuring fresh fish, shrimp,  crab, lobster,  scallops and other seafood in a casual atmosphere.  The menu includes a variety of specialty seafood and non-seafood entrees, appetizers and desserts.       Dinner entree prices range from $8.50 to $27.50, with certain lobster items available at market price.  Lunch entree prices range from $5.99 to $11.25.  The price of each entree includes side items and our signature Cheddar Bay biscuits. During fiscal 2004,  the average check per person was between $16.50 and $17.50, with  alcoholic  beverages  accounting  for about 8.4  percent of Red  Lobster's sales. Red Lobster maintains  approximately 105 different menus across its trade areas to reflect  geographic  differences  in consumer  preferences,  prices and selections,  as well as a lower-priced children's menu. Red Lobster is testing a number of new menu items to expand its current offerings.  Olive Garden       Olive  Garden is the  market  share  leader  among  casual  dining  Italian restaurants  in the United  States.  Olive  Garden's  menu includes a variety of authentic  Italian foods featuring  fresh  ingredients and an expanded wine list that includes a broad selection of wines imported from Italy.  The menu includes antipasti  (appetizers);  soups,  salad and garlic  breadsticks;  baked  pastas; sauteed specialties with chicken,  seafood and fresh vegetables;  grilled meats; and a variety of desserts. Olive Garden also uses coffee imported from Italy for its espresso and cappuccino.       Most dinner entree prices range from $7.95 to $17.95, and most lunch entree prices range from $5.95 to $9.50. The price of each entree also includes as much fresh salad or soup and breadsticks as a guest desires.  During fiscal 2004, the average  check  per  person  was  $13.50 to  $14.50,  with  alcoholic  beverages accounting for about 8.7 percent of Olive Garden's sales. Olive Garden maintains approximately  40  different  dinner  menus and 30 lunch menus  across its trade areas to reflect  geographic  differences  in consumer  preferences,  prices and selections, as well as two lower-priced children's menus.  Bahama Breeze       Bahama  Breeze  is a  Caribbean-themed  restaurant  that  offers  guests  a distinctive island dining experience. The first Bahama Breeze opened in 1996 and met with strong positive consumer response.  We continued to test the concept by opening a limited  number of  additional  restaurants  in each of the  following years,  and  began  national  expansion  of the  concept  in 1998.  The  concept continues to be well received by guests,  although its financial performance has not met our overall expectations. Bahama Breeze closed six restaurants and wrote down the carrying value of four others during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, reducing to 32 the total  number of  restaurants  in  operation.  In addition to closing the underperforming  restaurants,  we have made recent changes that have improved the sales,  financial  performance  and  long-term  potential of Bahama Breeze.  These changes include  implementing  lunch  operations,  creating a new dinner menu and slowing new  restaurant  development.  We also are  reducing the size of a typical Bahama Breeze building and the related capital  investment.  A new  reduced-investment  prototype building opened in Pittsburgh,  PA during the fourth  quarter of fiscal 2004 and the early  results are  encouraging.  We have postponed  any new  restaurant  expansion at Bahama Breeze while we evaluate the new prototype. In the meantime, the closure of some underperforming  restaurants during  fiscal  2004  allows  Bahama  Breeze  to focus  on its  most  profitable restaurants as it builds its business.  Smokey Bones       Smokey Bones features  barbequed pork,  beef and chicken,  as well as other grilled favorites, all served in a lively yet comfortable mountain-lodge setting that features  televised  sports.  We opened the first Smokey Bones in September 1999, and began national  expansion of the concept in fiscal 2002.  Smokey Bones has been well received by consumers and continues to expand  rapidly.  We opened 30 new Smokey Bones  restaurants  during fiscal 2004,  and had 69 restaurants in operation  at the end of the  fiscal  year.  We plan to open 30 to 40 new Smokey Bones                                         5 restaurants  in fiscal 2005.  We believe that Smokey Bones has strong  expansion potential  and is capable of  achieving  future  annual sales of $500 million or more.  Recent and Planned Growth       During fiscal 2004, we opened 66 new restaurants  (excluding the relocation of  existing  restaurants  to new sites and the  rebuilding  of  restaurants  at existing  sites)  and  closed  eight  restaurants.  In  addition,  we  had  four restaurants  closed  temporarily  at the end of  fiscal  2004  that we expect to reopen during fiscal 2005.  This resulted in a net increase of 54 restaurants in fiscal 2004. We plan to open approximately 49-65 new Red Lobster,  Olive Garden, Smokey  Bones  and  Seasons  52  restaurants   during  fiscal  2005   (excluding relocations  and  rebuilds).  Our actual and  projected  new openings by concept (excluding relocations and rebuilds) are shown below.

We have  continued  to test new  ideas  and  concepts,  and also to evaluate potential  acquisition  candidates to assess whether they would satisfy our strategic and financial  objectives.  At present, we have not identified any specific acquisitions.       In fiscal 2005, we will limit new restaurant expansion at Red Lobster while we continue to focus on improving operational returns for that concept. At Olive Garden,  we will  continue  to  focus on  maintaining  operational  returns  and expanding  that  concept to high  potential  sites that we believe can  generate significant  returns on our investments.  Olive Garden's  expansion will include its  recently   developed  "Tuscan   Farmhouse"  design,  an  outgrowth  of  our collaboration with Rocca delle Macie, a family-owned  winery in Tuscany,  Italy. We have postponed any new restaurant openings at Bahama Breeze while we evaluate the new reduced-investment  prototype restaurant opened in Pittsburgh, PA during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. We plan to continue to expand Smokey Bones in fiscal 2005 at a pace that we believe will enable each new restaurant to capture the concept's full potential. We plan to open two to three additional Seasons 52 restaurants  in fiscal 2005 to further  explore  the  concept's  viability.  The actual  number of openings for each of our concepts will depend on many factors, including our ability to locate appropriate sites, negotiate acceptable purchase or  lease  terms,   obtain  necessary  local  governmental   permits,   complete construction, and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel.       We consider  location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant's long-term  success,  and we  devote  significant  effort  to the site  selection process.  Prior to entering a market,  we conduct a thorough  study to determine the optimal  number and placement of  restaurants.  Our site  selection  process incorporates a variety of analytical  techniques to evaluate key factors.  These factors include trade area  demographics,  such as target population density and household  income levels;  competitive  influences in the trade area; the site's visibility,  accessibility and traffic volume; and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls, hotel/motel complexes, offices and universities. Members of senior management evaluate, inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition.  Constructing and opening a new restaurant  typically takes 120 to 180 days after permits are obtained and the site is acquired.       The following table illustrates the approximate average capital investment, size and dining capacity of the nine Red Lobster,  23 Olive Garden and 30 Smokey Bones  restaurants  that were opened during fiscal 2004 (excluding  relocations, rebuilds and conversions of existing restaurants).                                         6 Capital      Square    Dining    Dining                                     Investment(1)  Feet(2)  Seats(3)  Tables(4)                                     ------------   ------   -------   ---------       Red Lobster (5)..............  $3,475,000    6,954      221        59       Olive Garden (6).............  $3,963,000    7,445      214        60       Smokey Bones.................  $3,490,000    7,025      205        47  (1)  Includes net present value of leases, but excludes working capital. (2)  Includes all space under the roof, including the coolers and freezers,  but      excludes gazebos, pavilions and porte cocheres. (3)  Includes bar dining seats and patio seating,  but excludes bar stools. (4)  Includes patio dining tables. (5)  Excludes one center city urban Red Lobster  restaurant whose size is larger      and cost is  significantly  higher than the average  and  therefore  is not      representative of the typical restaurant. (6)  Excludes one center city urban Olive Garden restaurant whose size is larger      and cost is  significantly  higher than the average  and  therefore  is not      representative of the typical restaurant.       We systematically  review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards.  When a restaurant falls below minimum  standards, we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes, and implement  marketing and operational plans to improve that restaurant's  performance.  If performance does  not  improve  to  acceptable  levels,  the  restaurant  is  evaluated  for relocation, closing or conversion to one of our other concepts.       During fiscal 2004, we permanently closed two and relocated ten Red Lobster restaurants.  During the same period,  we relocated one Olive Garden  restaurant and permanently closed our one remaining Olive Garden Cafe. In addition,  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we closed six Bahama Breeze  restaurants  and wrote down the carrying value of four other Bahama Breeze restaurants, one Olive Garden restaurant,  and one Red Lobster restaurant,  which continued to operate. The decision to close or write down the carrying  value of the  restaurants  was the result of our on-going  analysis that examines  restaurants  not meeting our minimum return on investment  thresholds and certain other operating performance criteria.  The decision to close and write-down the carrying value of the Bahama Breeze  restaurants also reflected an analysis of each  restaurant's  ability to successfully implement the changes effected over the past year to improve sales, financial performance, and overall long-term potential of the concept, including the addition of lunch and adoption of a new dinner menu.  The  write-down of the carrying value of the one Olive Garden restaurant and one Red Lobster restaurant was a result of  less-than-optimal  locations.  We continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future asset impairment charges.  Restaurant Operations       We believe  that  high-quality  restaurant  management  is  critical to our long-term  success.  We  also  believe  that  our  leadership  position,  strong success-oriented   culture  and  various  short-term  and  long-term   incentive programs, including stock options, restricted stock or stock units, help attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers.       Our restaurant  management structure varies by concept and restaurant size. Each  restaurant  is led by a  general  manager  and  three  to five  additional managers,  depending  on  the  operating  complexity  and  sales  volume  of the restaurant.  Each  restaurant  also  employs  approximately  65  to  140  hourly employees,  most of whom work part-time.  We issue detailed  operations  manuals covering  all aspects of  restaurant  operations,  as well as food and  beverage manuals which detail the preparation  procedures of our formulated recipes.  The restaurant management teams are responsible for the day-to-day operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards.  At our two largest  concepts,  Red Lobster and Olive Garden,  restaurant  general  managers report to directors. Each director was responsible for five to 11 restaurants at the end of fiscal 2004,  compared to our target range of seven to 12 restaurants for  each  director.   Restaurants  are  visited  regularly  by  all  levels  of supervision to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards.       Each concept's vice president or director of training, together with senior operations  executives,  is  responsible  for developing  and  maintaining  that concept's  operations  training programs.  These efforts include a 12                                         7 to 15-week training program for management trainees,  and continuing development programs for managers,  supervisors and directors.  The emphasis of the training and development  programs varies by restaurant concept, but includes leadership, restaurant  business  management  and  culinary  skills.  We also  use a  highly structured  training  program  to  open  new  restaurants,  including  deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations.  The opening training teams  typically begin work one week prior to opening and remain at the new  restaurant  one  week  following  the  opening.  They  are  re-deployed  as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant's operating staff.  Quality Assurance       Our Total  Quality  Department  helps ensure that all  restaurants  provide safe,  high-quality  food in a clean  and  safe  environment.  Through  rigorous physical  evaluation and testing at our North American  laboratories and through "point source  inspection" by our international  team of Quality  Specialists in several  foreign  countries,  we purchase only seafood that meets or exceeds our specifications.  We use  independent  third  parties  to  inspect  and  evaluate commodity  vendors.  In addition,  any commodity  supplier that produces a "high risk"  product is subject to a minimum  annual food safety  evaluation by Darden personnel.  We require our suppliers to maintain sound  manufacturing  practices and operate with the comprehensive HACCP food safety programs in place.       Since 1976, we have  maintained a  microbiological  laboratory to routinely test seafood and other  commodities for quality and  microbiological  safety. In addition,  Darden Total  Quality  Managers and third party  auditors  visit each restaurant  periodically  throughout  the year to review  food  handling  and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation.  The Total Quality managers  also serve as a liaison to regulatory  agencies on issues  relating to food safety.  Purchasing and Distribution       Our ability to ensure a consistent supply of high-quality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant concepts depends upon procurement from reliable  sources.  Our purchasing staff sources,  negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 2,000 suppliers in 45 countries. Suppliers must meet strict quality control  standards in the  development,  harvest,  catch and production of food products. Competitive bids, long-term contracts and long-term vendor  relationships  are  routinely  used to manage  availability  and cost of products.       We believe  that our  seafood  purchasing  capabilities  are a  significant competitive advantage.  Our purchasing staff travels routinely within the United States and  internationally  to source more than 100  varieties  of  top-quality seafood at competitive  prices.  We believe that we have  established  excellent long-term relationships with key seafood vendors, and usually source our product directly from  producers  (not brokers or  middlemen).  We operate a procurement office in Singapore,  our only purchasing  office outside of Orlando,  to source products  directly  from Asia.  While the supply of certain  seafood  species is volatile,  we believe that we have the ability to identify  alternative  seafood products and to adjust our menus as necessary. All other essential food products are  available,  or can be made available  upon short notice,  from  alternative qualified suppliers. Because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products, inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales.  Controlled inventories of specified products are distributed to all restaurants through independent national distribution companies.       Our  supplier  diversity  program  is an  integral  part of our  purchasing efforts.  Through it, we identify  minority and  women-owned  vendors and assist them in  establishing  supplier  relationships  with us. We are committed to the development  and growth of minority and women-owned  enterprises,  and in fiscal 2004 we spent  more than five  percent  and one  percent,  respectively,  of our purchasing dollars with those firms.  Advertising and Marketing       We believe that we have  developed  significant  marketing and  advertising capabilities.  Our size  enables  us to be a leading  advertiser  in the  casual dining segment of the restaurant industry. Red Lobster and Olive Garden leverage the efficiency of national network television advertising and supplement it with local television advertising. Bahama Breeze and Smokey Bones do not use national television advertising.  Our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising and product promotions to attract customers. We implement periodic                                         8 promotions  as  appropriate  to maintain and increase our sales and profits.  We also rely on radio and  newspaper  advertising,  as well as newspaper and direct mail couponing programs, as appropriate, to attract customers. We have developed and consistently use sophisticated  consumer  marketing  research  techniques to monitor customer satisfaction and evolving expectations.  Employees       At the end of fiscal 2004, we employed  approximately  141,300 persons.  Of these  employees,  approximately  1,300 were  corporate  or  restaurant  concept personnel  located  in  our  restaurant  support  center  in  Orlando,  Florida, approximately 5,820 were restaurant  management  personnel in the restaurants or in field offices,  and the remainder were hourly  restaurant  personnel.  Of the restaurant  support center  employees,  approximately 60 percent were management personnel and the balance were administrative or office employees. Our operating executives  have an  average  of more than 14 years of  experience  with us. The restaurant general managers average 12 years with us. We believe that we provide working  conditions and  compensation  that compare  favorably with those of our competitors.  Most  employees,  other than  restaurant  management and corporate management,  are paid on an hourly basis. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.  Information Technology       We strive for leadership in the restaurant  business by using technology as a competitive  advantage and as an enabler for our  strategic  building  blocks. Since 1975, computers located in the restaurants have been used to assist in the management of the restaurants.  We have implemented systems targeted at improved financial control, cost management, enhanced guest service and improved employee effectiveness.  Management  information  systems are  designed to be used across restaurant  concepts,  yet are flexible  enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant  concept.  In the past three years,  we have  implemented  a suite of web-enabled and fully integrated financial and human resource (including payroll and benefits) systems.  We also implemented a high-speed data network connecting all restaurants to all current and anticipated future applications.       Restaurant  hardware and software  support is provided or coordinated  from the restaurant support center in Orlando, Florida, seven days a week, 24 hours a day. A communications  network sends and receives  critical business data to and from  the  restaurants  throughout  the  day and  night,  providing  timely  and extensive  information on business  activity in every  location.  The restaurant support center houses our data center, which contains sufficient computing power to  process  information  from all  restaurants  quickly  and  efficiently.  Our information  is  processed in a secured  environment  to protect both the actual data  and the  physical  assets.  We  guard  against  business  interruption  by maintaining a disaster  recovery plan, which includes storing critical  business information off-site,  testing the disaster recovery plan at a hot-site facility and  providing  on-site  power  backup  via a  large  diesel  generator.  We use internally developed proprietary  software, as well as purchased software,  with proven, non-proprietary hardware. This allows processing power to be distributed effectively to each of our restaurants.       Our  management   believes  that  our  current   systems  and  practice  of implementing  regular updates will position us well to support current needs and future growth. We are committed to maintaining an industry  leadership  position in information systems and computing technology.  We use a strategic information systems planning process that involves senior  management and is integrated into our overall  business  planning.  Information  systems  projects are prioritized based  upon  strategic,  financial,  regulatory  and  other  business  advantage criteria.  Competition       The restaurant  industry is intensely  competitive with respect to the type and quality of food, price, service,  restaurant location,  personnel,  concept, attractiveness  of facilities,  and  effectiveness of advertising and marketing. The  restaurant  business  is often  affected  by  changes in  consumer  tastes; national,  regional or local economic  conditions;  demographic trends;  traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing restaurants; and consumers' discretionary  purchasing power. We compete within each market with national and regional  chains and  locally-owned  restaurants  for customers,  management and hourly   personnel  and  suitable  real  estate  sites.  We  also  face  growing competition from the supermarket  industry,  which offers  "convenient meals" in the form of improved  entrees and side dishes from the deli  section.  We expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas.                                         9 Other factors  pertaining to our  competitive  position in the industry are addressed   under  the  sections   entitled   "Purchasing   and   Distribution," "Advertising  and  Marketing,"  "Information  Technology"  and  "Forward-Looking Statements" elsewhere in this report.  Trademarks and Related Agreements       We regard our  Darden  Restaurants(R),  Red  Lobster(R),  Olive  Garden(R), Bahama  Breeze(R),  Smokey  Bones  Barbeque & GrillSM and Seasons  52SM  service marks, and other variations of these service marks, as having  significant value and as being  important in marketing  the  restaurants.  Our policy is to pursue registration  of our  important  service  marks  and  trademarks  and to  oppose vigorously any infringement of them.  Generally,  with  appropriate  renewal and use, the registration of our service marks will continue indefinitely.       Our only restaurant  operations outside of North America  historically have been  conducted  through an Area  Development  and Franchise  Agreement with Red Lobster  Japan  Co.,  Ltd.  ("Red  Lobster  Japan"),  an  unaffiliated  Japanese corporation.  Red Lobster Japan operated 38 Red Lobster  restaurants in Japan as of May 30, 2004. We do not have an ownership  interest in Red Lobster Japan, but receive royalty income under the Franchise Agreement.  The amount of this income is not material to our consolidated financial statements.  Seasonality       Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally.  During fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002,  our sales were highest in the spring,  lowest in the fall, and comparable during winter and summer.  Holidays,  severe weather and similar  conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions.  Government Regulation       We are  subject to various  federal,  state and local  laws  affecting  our business.  Each of our restaurants  must comply with licensing  requirements and regulations  by a number of  governmental  authorities,  which  include  health, safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located.  The development  and operation of restaurants  depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use,  environmental, traffic and other regulations.  To date, we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals.       Presently  about 9.3 percent of our sales are  attributable  to the sale of alcoholic beverages.  Regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site (in most  cases,  on an annual  basis),  and  licenses  may be  revoked  or suspended  for cause at any time.  These  regulations  relate to many aspects of restaurant operation,  including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, and storage and dispensing of alcoholic  beverages.  The failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain  these  licenses  would  adversely  affect the  restaurant's operations. We also are subject in certain states to "dram-shop" statutes, which generally  provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment  that serves alcoholic  beverages to an intoxicated  person, who then causes injury to himself or a third  party.  We carry  liquor  liability  coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance.       We also are subject to federal and state  minimum  wage laws and other laws governing  such matters as overtime,  tip credits,  working  conditions,  safety standards,  and hiring and  employment  practices.  Changes in these laws during fiscal 2004 have not had a material effect on our operations.       We currently are operating under a Tip Rate Alternative Commitment ("TRAC") agreement with the Internal Revenue Service.  Through increased  educational and other efforts in the restaurants,  the TRAC agreement  reduces the likelihood of potential chain-wide employer-only FICA assessments for unreported tips.       We are subject to federal and state  environmental  regulations,  but these rules have not had a material  effect on our  operations.  During  fiscal  2004, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated.                                         10 Our  facilities  must  comply  with  the  applicable  requirements  of  the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA") and related state  accessibility statutes.  Under the ADA and related  state  laws,  we must  provide  equivalent service  to  disabled  persons,  and make  reasonable  accommodation  for  their employment,  and when constructing or undertaking  significant remodeling of our restaurants, we must make those facilities accessible.  Executive Officers of the Registrant       Our executive  officers as of August 12, 2004 are listed  below.  On August 11,  2004,  we announced  that after 37 years with our company,  Joe R. Lee will retire as our Chief Executive Officer effective  November 29, 2004.

Forward-Looking Statements       Certain information included in this report and other materials filed or to be  filed  by us  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (as  well as information included in oral or written statements made by us or on our behalf), may contain forward-looking  statements about our future performance,  plans and objectives, long-term goals, forecasts of market trends and other matters. These statements  may be  contained in our filings  with the  Securities  and Exchange Commission, in our press releases, in other written communications,  and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized officers. Words or phrases such as "believe," "plan," "will likely result," "expect,"  "intend," "will continue," "is anticipated," "estimate," "project" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking  statements.  These statements, and any other statements that are not historical facts, are  forward-looking  statements within the meaning of the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as codified  in Section  27A of the  Securities  Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended from time to time (the "Act"). These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to,                                         12 projections regarding:  our growth plans and the number and type of expected new restaurant  openings;  same-restaurant  sales  growth for Red  Lobster and Olive Garden;  diluted net earnings per share growth in fiscal 2005; and  expectations regarding when Bahama Breeze and Smokey Bones will become accretive to earnings.       In connection  with the "safe harbor"  provisions of the Act, we are filing the following  cautionary  statements to identify important  factors,  risks and uncertainties  that could  cause our actual  results to differ  materially  from those  projected  in  forward-looking  statements  made by us, or on our behalf. These cautionary statements are to be used as a reference in connection with any forward-looking  statements.  The factors, risks and uncertainties identified in these  cautionary  statements  are in addition to those  contained  in any other cautionary statements, written or oral, which may be made or otherwise addressed in  connection  with a  forward-looking  statement  or  contained  in any of our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because of these factors,  risks and uncertainties,  we caution against placing undue reliance on forward-looking statements.  Although we believe that the assumptions underlying our forward-looking  statements are reasonable,  any of the assumptions could be incorrect,  and there can be no assurance  that the  forward-looking  statements will prove to be accurate.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. We do not  undertake any  obligation to modify or revise any  forward-looking  statement  to  take  into  account  or  otherwise  reflect subsequent   events,   or   circumstances   arising  after  the  date  that  the forward-looking statement was made.       The following  factors,  risks and  uncertainties,  have affected,  and may continue to affect,  our operating  results and the environment  within which we conduct our  business.  If our  projections  and estimates  regarding  these key factors differ  materially from what actually  occurs,  our actual results could vary  significantly  from  the  performance  projected  in  our  forward-looking statements.       Competition.  The  casual  dining  sector  of the  restaurant  industry  is intensely competitive in pricing,  service,  location,  personnel,  and type and quality of food.  We compete with  national,  regional  and local  organizations primarily  through the quality,  variety and value perception of menu items. The number and location of restaurants,  type of concept,  quality and efficiency of service,  attractiveness  of facilities and  effectiveness  of  advertising  and marketing  programs  are also  important  factors.  We  anticipate  that intense competition will continue in all of these areas.       Economic,  Market and Other  Conditions.  Certain  risks are endemic to the restaurant and retail  industry in general.  A protracted  economic  slowdown or worsening economy,  industry-wide  cost pressures,  or public safety conditions, including  ongoing  concerns about  terrorism  threats or the  continuing  armed conflict in Iraq,  could affect  consumer  behavior and spending for  restaurant dining occasions and lead to  same-restaurant  sales declines and lower profits. The casual  dining sector of the  restaurant  industry is affected by changes in national,  regional  and  local  economic  conditions;  the  seasonality  of our business;  consumer  preferences,  including  changes in consumer tastes and the level of consumer  acceptance  of our  restaurant  concepts;  consumer  spending patterns;  demographic trends;  weather;  traffic patterns; and the type, number and location of competing  restaurants.  Our ability to undertake new restaurant development,  as well as improvements and additions to existing restaurants,  is affected  by economic  conditions,  including  interest  rates,  and  government policies  impacting land and construction costs and the cost and availability of borrowed funds.       Price and  Availability  of Food,  Labor,  Utilities,  Insurance and Media; Other  Costs.  Our  profitability   depends  significantly  on  our  ability  to anticipate and react to changes in the price and  availability  of food;  labor; utilities;  insurance  (including  workers'  compensation,   general  liability, health, and directors and officers' liability insurance); advertising, media and marketing;  employee  benefits;  and other  costs over which we may have  little control.  The price and  availability  of  commodities,  including,  among other things, shrimp,  lobster, crab and other seafood, are subject to fluctuation and could  increase or decrease more than we expect.  Tariffs on imported  shrimp or other  commodities  could  increase our costs and possibly  impact the supply of those  goods.  We are  subject to the general  risk of  inflation  and  possible shortages  or  interruptions  in supply  caused by  inclement  weather  or other conditions that could adversely affect the availability and cost of the items we buy.  Restaurant  pre-opening  expenses could be more than  expected,  and labor shortages,  increased  employee turnover and higher minimum wage rates all could raise our cost of doing  business.  Our business  also is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, consumers,  suppliers,  shareholders or others that may result in additional  costs.  There can be no assurance that  management will be able to  anticipate  and react to these cost issues  without a material  adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.                                         13 Unfavorable Publicity Relating to Food Safety or Other Concerns. Multi-unit restaurant  businesses  can be adversely  affected by publicity  resulting  from complaints  or  litigation  alleging  poor  food  quality,  food-borne  illness, personal injury,  adverse health effects including obesity, or other operational concerns.  Negative  publicity may also result from actual or alleged violations of dram shop laws that may impose  liability  on sellers of liquors when a third party  is  injured  as a result  of  intoxication.  Regardless  of  whether  the allegations are valid,  unfavorable  publicity relating to just one or a limited number of restaurants  could taint public  perception of the entire brand.  Such unfavorable publicity and overall consumer perceptions of food safety could have a material adverse effect on our business.       Importance of Locations.  The success of our  restaurants  depends in large part on location. There can be no assurance that current locations will continue to  be  attractive,   as  demographic  patterns  change.  Possible  declines  in neighborhoods where restaurants are located, or economic conditions  surrounding those neighborhoods, could result in reduced sales in those locations.       Government  Regulation and Litigation.  We are subject to various  federal, state and local laws affecting our business.  The  development  and operation of restaurants  depend to a significant  extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to zoning,  land use,  environmental,  traffic and other regulations.  Restaurant  operations are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local departments  relating to health,  liquor licenses, sanitation  and safety  standards,  federal and state labor laws  (including the Fair Labor  Standards Act and applicable  minimum wage  requirements,  overtime, working and safety conditions, and citizenship requirements),  federal and state laws which  prohibit  discrimination  and other laws  regulating  the design and operation of facilities, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. We cannot predict the effect on our operations of these laws and  regulations,  the future enactment of additional  legislation regulating these and other areas, or actual or potential  litigation in  connection  with current and future laws and regulations.       Growth Plans. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our growth objectives or that new restaurants opened or acquired will be profitable. There are inherent  risks  involved with  expanding new concepts (such as Bahama Breeze and Smokey Bones) that have not yet proved their long-term viability. The opening and success of  restaurants  depends on various  factors,  including the identification  and availability of suitable and economically  viable locations; sales levels at existing  restaurants;  the  negotiation of acceptable  lease or purchase terms for new locations;  obtaining all required  governmental permits, including  zoning  approvals  and  liquor  licenses,  on a timely  basis;  other regulatory   compliance;   the   availability   of   necessary   contracts   and subcontractors  and the ability to meet construction  schedules;  our ability to manage union activities such as picketing,  which could delay construction;  the availability  of capital at affordable  cost to finance  growth;  changes in the weather  or other  acts of God that  could  result in  construction  delays  and adversely  affect the results of one or more  restaurants  for an  indeterminate amount of time; our ability to hire and train  qualified  management  personnel; and general economic and business conditions.                                         14 Item 2.  PROPERTIES       As of May 30,  2004,  we  operated  1,325  restaurants  (including  680 Red Lobster,  543 Olive Garden, 32 Bahama Breeze, 69 Smokey Bones and one Seasons 52 restaurants) in the following locations:    Alabama (21)       Iowa (14)           Nevada (12)           South Dakota (3)   Arizona (29)       Kansas (11)         New Hampshire (3)     Tennessee (31)   Arkansas (10)      Kentucky (16)       New Jersey (27)       Texas (108)   California (95)    Louisiana (9)       New Mexico (11)       Utah (13)   Colorado (25)      Maine (3)           New York (50)         Vermont (1)   Connecticut (9)    Maryland (22)       North Carolina (31)   Virginia (41)   Delaware (4)       Massachusetts (9)   North Dakota (4)      Washington (25)   Florida (138)      Michigan (52)       Ohio (80)             West Virginia (6)   Georgia (58)       Minnesota (24)      Oklahoma (17)         Wisconsin (20)   Hawaii (1)         Mississippi (7)     Oregon (12)           Wyoming (2)   Idaho (6)          Missouri (29)       Pennsylvania (66)     Canada (37)   Illinois (56)      Montana (2)         Rhode Island (2)   Indiana (45)       Nebraska (8)        South Carolina (20)       Of our 1,325  restaurants  open on May 30, 2004,  816 were located on owned sites and 509 were located on leased  sites.  The 509 leases are  classified  as follows:           Land-Only Leases (we own buildings and equipment)............   391          Ground and Building Leases...................................    61          Space/In-Line/Other Leases...................................    57                                                                           --                   Total...............................................   509                                                                          ===       During fiscal 1999, we formed two  subsidiary  corporations,  each of which elected to be taxed as a Real Estate  Investment  Trust  ("REIT") under Sections 856  through  860 of the  Internal  Revenue  Code.  These  elections  limit  the activities  of both  corporations  to holding  certain real estate  assets.  The formation of these two REITs is designed  primarily to assist us in managing our real  estate  portfolio  and  possibly  to provide a vehicle  to access  capital markets in the future.       Both REITs are  non-public  REITs.  Through our  subsidiary  companies,  we indirectly  own 100 percent of all voting stock and greater than 99.5 percent of the total value of each REIT. For financial reporting  purposes,  both REITs are included in our consolidated financial statements.       We own or  lease  our  executive  offices,  culinary  center  and  training facilities in Orlando,  Florida.  Except in limited  instances,  our  restaurant sites and other facilities are not subject to mortgages or encumbrances securing money  borrowed by us from outside  sources.  In our opinion,  our buildings and equipment  generally  are in good  condition,  suitable  for their  purposes and adequate  for  our  current  and  foreseeable  needs.  See  also  Note 4  "Land, Buildings,  and  Equipment"  and Note 11 "Leases"  under  Notes to  Consolidated Financial  Statements  in our 2004 Annual Report to  Shareholders,  incorporated herein by reference.  Item 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS       In March  2003 and March  2002,  three of our  current  and  former  hourly restaurant  employees filed two purported  class action  lawsuits  against us in California  Superior  Court of Orange County  alleging  violations of California labor laws with respect to providing  meal and rest  breaks.  The lawsuits  seek penalties under Department of Labor rules providing a $100 penalty per violation per  employee,  plus  attorney's  fees on  behalf  of the  plaintiffs  and other purported class members.  Discovery is currently underway in these matters.  One of the cases was removed to our  mandatory  arbitration  program,  although  the Court retained the authority to permit a sample of class-wide discovery.  We are prosecuting  an  appeal  to cause  the other  case to be  similarly  removed  to arbitration. In September 2003, three former employees in Washington State filed a similar  purported class action in Washington  State Superior Court in Spokane County  alleging  violations of Washington  labor laws with respect to providing rest breaks.  The Court stayed the action,  and ordered the plaintiffs  into our mandatory   arbitration   program;  the  plaintiffs                                         15 have  filed a motion for  reconsideration.  We intend to  vigorously  defend our position in all of these  cases.  Although  the  outcome of the cases  cannot be ascertained at this time, we do not believe that the disposition of these cases, either individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.       We are subject to other private  lawsuits,  administrative  proceedings and claims  that  arise  in the  ordinary  course  of our  business.  These  matters typically   involve  claims  from  guests,   employees  and  others  related  to operational  issues  common  to the  restaurant  industry.  A  number  of  these lawsuits,  proceedings  and  claims  may  exist at any given  time.  We could be affected by adverse publicity resulting from the allegations comprising a claim, regardless  of whether the  allegations  are valid or whether we are  ultimately found  liable.  From time to time,  we also are involved in lawsuits  related to infringement  of, or challenges to, our  trademarks.  We do not believe that the final disposition of the lawsuits and claims in which we are currently  involved will have a  material  adverse  effect on our  financial  position,  results  of operations or liquidity.  Item 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS           Not applicable.                                        PART II  Item 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S  COMMON EQUITY,  RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND         ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES       The principal United States market on which our common shares are traded is the New York Stock  Exchange.  As of July 26,  2004,  there  were  approximately 37,501 record  holders of our common  shares.  The  information  concerning  the dividends  and high and low intraday  sales prices for our common  shares on the New York Stock  Exchange for each full  quarterly  period during fiscal 2003 and 2004  contained  in Note 18,  "Quarterly  Data  (unaudited)"  in our 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders is incorporated herein by reference. We have not sold any securities  during  the last  three  years  that were not  registered  under the Securities Act of 1933.
