Growth Strategy Apaches mission is to grow a profitable global exploration and production company in a safe and environmentally responsible manner for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. Apaches long-term perspective has many dimensions, which are centered on the following core strategic components:  diverse portfolio of core assets  conservative capital structure  rate of return focus 1 Table of Contents Throughout the cycles of our industry, these strategies have underpinned our ability to deliver long-term production and reserve growth and achieve competitive returns on invested capital for the benefit of our shareholders. We have increased reserves 23 out of the last 28 years and production 32 out of the past 35 years, a testament to our consistency over the long-term.
Apache pursues growth opportunities through exploration and development drilling, supplemented by occasional strategic acquisitions and portfolio highgrading through asset divestitures. At the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013, Apache undertook a strategic review of our portfolio with the ultimate goal of keeping the right mix of assets that generate strong returns and excess cash flow and drive more predictable production growth to create shareholder value. In May 2013, Apache announced that it would divest approximately $4 billion in assets and use the proceeds to pay down debt and repurchase Apache common shares. Apache surpassed these goals, divesting approximately $7 billion of assets, paying down $2.6 billion in debt, and repurchasing $1 billion in Apache common shares during 2013. Significant transactions since announcing our strategic repositioning initiatives include:  Argentina Divestiture On February12, 2014, Apache subsidiaries announced an agreement to sell all of its operations in Argentina to YPF Sociedad Annima (YPF) for cash consideration of $800 million plus the assumption of $52 million of bank debt. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014.
Egypt Sinopec Partnership On November14, 2013, Apache announced the completion of the sale of a one-third minority participation in its Egypt oil and gas business to a subsidiary of Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec). Apache received cash consideration of $2.95 billion. This noncontrolling interest is recorded separately in the Companys financial statements.
Gulf of Mexico Shelf Divestiture On September30, 2013, Apache completed the sale of its Gulf of Mexico Shelf operations and properties to Fieldwood Energy LLC (Fieldwood), an affiliate of Riverstone Holdings. Under the terms of the agreement, Apache received cash consideration of $3.7 billion, and Fieldwood assumed $1.5 billion of discounted asset abandonment liabilities. Additionally, Apache retained 50 percent of its ownership interest in both exploration blocks and in horizons below production in developed blocks, and access to existing infrastructure.
Canadian Divestitures In the third and fourth quarters of 2013, Apache completed three separate divestitures of oil and gas producing properties in Canada for total cash consideration of $326 million before customary post-closing adjustments.
Our growth portfolio going forward will be centered on (i)increasing onshore North American liquids production that provides for more predictable and attractive rates of return, (ii)generating excess cash flow from our international operations, and (iii)continuing longer-term growth initiatives, which include our Wheatstone and Kitimat LNG projects. In 2013, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our transition towards North American Onshore liquids growth, with all four of our onshore North American regions increasing liquids production and by replacing more than our worldwide production through our exploration and development activities.
For a more in-depth discussion of our growth strategy, 2013 results, and the Companys capital resources and liquidity, please see Part II, Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.
2 Table of Contents Geographic Area Overviews During 2013, we had exploration and production interests in six countries: the U.S., Canada, Egypt, Australia, the U.K. North Sea, and Argentina. Apache also pursues exploration interests in other countries that may over time result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities.
The following table sets out a brief comparative summary of certain key 2013 data for each of our operating areas. Additional data and discussion is provided in Part II, Item7 of this Form 10-K.

North America Apaches North American asset base primarily comprises operations in the Permian Basin, the Anadarko basin in western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, Gulf Coast onshore and offshore areas of the U.S., and in Western Canada. We also have leasehold acreage holdings in the Cook Inlet of Alaska and other areas where we are pursuing exploration opportunities. Over the past several years, the Company has acquired significant acreage positions in many attractive basins and plays across North America. This extensive portfolio expansion phase shifted during 2013 when we completed strategic divestitures to rebalance our portfolio to an asset mix that we believe will continue to generate strong returns, drive more predictable growth and deliver increased value to our shareholders. As part of this effort, Apaches drilling activity has focused on our North America onshore assets, which had liquids growth of 34 percent during 2013, primarily in the Permian Basin and Anadarko basin.
North America contributed approximately 58 percent of our worldwide production and 50 percent of our oil and gas production revenues for the year. At year-end 2013, North America held 68 percent of our estimated worldwide proved reserves including noncontrolling interests in Egypt.
United States Overview We have access to significant liquid hydrocarbons across our 11.5million gross acres in the U.S., approximately 75 percent of which is undeveloped. In 2013, 61 percent of our U.S. production and 67 percent of our U.S. year-end reserves were oil and natural gas liquids. Approximately 44 percent of Apaches worldwide equivalent 2013 production and 51 percent of our estimated proved reserves were in the U.S. To better control our development efforts across broad acreage positions within the U.S., during 2013 our assets were divided into five regions: Permian, Central, Gulf Coast Onshore, Gulf of Mexico Deepwater, and the Gulf of Mexico Shelf. In 2014, the Gulf of Mexico Shelf region and Gulf of Mexico Deepwater region have been combined into the Gulf of Mexico region.
3 Table of Contents Permian Region Our Permian region controls over 3.3million gross acres with exposure to numerous plays across the Permian Basin. Apache is one of the largest operators in the Permian Basin, with more than 13,500 producing wells in 155 fields, including 47 waterfloods and seven CO 2 floods. Total region production for 2013 was up over 17 percent sequentially as a result of an active drilling program where we ran an average of 42 rigs during the year. Production in the region has increased for 12 consecutive quarters. During the year, we drilled or participated in drilling 785 wells, of which 186 were horizontal. The Permian regions year-end 2013 estimated proved reserves were 910 MMboe, representing 14 percent growth over year-end 2012.
A key focus area of our activity during the year continued to be the multi-zone development of the Deadwood area. Deadwood is the most active of our plays in the Midland basin where we ran an average of nearly 10 rigs and drilled 189 wells. Our activity in the Deadwood area is primarily drilling vertical wells targeting the Wolfwood and the Fusselman zones.
Over the past several years, the region has been testing numerous formations and building a large inventory of horizontal opportunities in several plays across our acreage position. Our success has led the region to increase the number of horizontal drilling rigs being utilized throughout 2013, and now approximately half of our rigs are drilling horizontal wells. In 2013, we ramped up multi-rig development programs in several horizontal plays in the Midland basin, targeting the Wolfcamp and Cline Shales. We have also increased development activity in our Yeso area of New Mexico and across the Permians Central Basin Platform. These extensive programs will carry into 2014 and drive the regions growth.
We continue to balance large development programs with exploration activity in several new areas. Given its acreage holdings, recent seismic data acquisitions and continued exploration efforts, the region has built a deep portfolio of drilling inventory and opportunities to sustain our activity for many years. For 2014, the Permian region plans to invest approximately $2.55 billion. The regions capital program covers planned expenditures for drilling, completions, recompletion projects, equipment upgrades, expansion of existing facilities and equipment, plugging and abandonment, seismic studies, and leasing additional acreage.
Central Region The Central region controls 1.8million gross acres that are mostly held-by-production and includes more than 3,800 producing wells primarily in western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. The region was Apaches first core area and has historically grown through low-risk, highly predictable exploitation. Over the last several years, the region has aggressively targeted oil and liquids-rich gas plays through horizontal drilling across its acreage holdings. Oil and liquids production expanded during 2013, with oil production growth of 61 percent and NGL production more than doubling compared to the prior year. Total region production in 2013 was 91 Mboe/d, of which 50 percent was oil and natural gas liquids. As of year-end, the Central regions estimated proved reserves totaled 304 MMboe, an increase of nearly 14 percent from year-end 2012.
The primary factor driving the regions growth in 2013 was an active drilling program where we ran an average of 24 rigs during the year, over a 30 percent increase from the prior year. We drilled or participated in drilling 322 wells during 2013, with 98 percent being completed as producers.
The vast majority of our drilling activity has been in the Anadarko basin, which consists of a series of thick, stacked formations of liquids-rich, low-permeability sandstones. The Companys significant acreage position in the basin provides a robust drilling inventory for the next several years across numerous horizontal liquids plays, notably the Granite Wash, Tonkawa, Marmaton, Cottage Grove, and Cleveland. In addition, in 2013 the region continued to invest in infrastructure facilities and contractually secure takeaway capacity.
In addition, in 2011 Apache acquired 92,000 contiguous net acres in the Whittenburg basin, located approximately 70 miles west of our Anadarko basin properties. The region has operated two drilling rigs targeting vertical objectives in 2012 and 2013, completing 26 vertical wells into the Canyon Wash sand and achieving a peak production rate of 10 Mb/d and 16 MMcf/d. Apache has now turned its attention to the prolific Canyon lime and is currently drilling its first horizontal test.
4 Table of Contents The Central region plans to run an average of 34 rigs during 2014 and invest approximately $1.75 billion for drilling, recompletions, equipment upgrades, and production enhancement projects.
Gulf Coast Regions Our Gulf Coast assets are primarily located in and along the Gulf of Mexico, in the areas onshore and offshore Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. During 2013 the area was divided into three regions, which include the Gulf Coast Onshore, Gulf of Mexico Deepwater, and Gulf of Mexico Shelf. In 2014, the Gulf of Mexico Shelf region and Gulf of Mexico Deepwater region have been combined into the Gulf of Mexico region.
Apaches Gulf Coast Onshore region is known for its proven onshore and near-shore basins of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi where it has a significant acreage position of approximately 1.3million gross acres, including approximately 275,000 mineral fee acres. During the year, the region primarily drilled shallow and moderate-depth development wells and completed the construction of gathering and processing facilities in our Atchafalaya Bay development project. The region also continued evaluating deeper exploitation opportunities and several unconventional resource plays, which included drilling three Eagle Ford shale wells on our Southeast Texas acreage with plans to substantially increase activity in 2014. For the year, the region drilled or participated in drilling 43 wells and projects drilling approximately 90 wells in 2014.
In offshore waters greater than 500 feet deep, the Gulf of Mexico Deepwater region is a relatively underexplored and oil-prone area that provides exposure to significant reserve and production potential. The Company owns over 900,000 gross acres across nearly 170 blocks as of the end of 2013. The Deepwater region contributed approximately two percent of Apaches worldwide production with multiple projects and developments underway. The non-operated Lucius project, where Apache holds an 11.7 percent working interest, is currently under development with first production projected by year-end 2014. In addition, the large scale non-operated Heidelberg project was sanctioned in late 2012. Apache has a 12.5 percent working interest in this development with first production projected for 2016.
Apaches former Gulf of Mexico Shelf region, constituting Gulf assets in waters less than 500 feet deep, experienced a significant shift during 2013 as the regions producing base and associated infrastructure was sold to Fieldwood in September. As part of the transaction, Apache retained 50 percent of its ownership interest in all exploration blocks and in horizons below production in developed blocks, and access to existing infrastructure. These retained interests cover approximately 2.5million gross acres across 515 offshore blocks. Several wells are expected to be drilled during 2014, and we expect future activities to provide a platform for continued exploration growth in this basin. Total region production in 2013 was 71 Mboe/d, reflecting nine months of Shelf production prior to the divestiture.
In 2014, Apache plans to invest approximately $550 million and $450 million in its Gulf Coast (formerly Gulf Coast Onshore) and Gulf of Mexico regions, respectively. The capital will be spent on drilling, recompletion, and development projects, equipment upgrades, production enhancement projects, seismic acquisitions, additional leasing activity, and plugging and abandonment of wells and platforms.
U.S. Marketing In general, most of our U.S. gas is sold at either monthly or daily market prices. Also, from time to time, the Company will enter into fixed physical sales contracts for durations of up to one-year. These physical sales volumes are typically sold at fixed prices over the term of the contract. Our natural gas is sold primarily to local distribution companies (LDCs), utilities, end-users, marketers, and integrated major oil companies. We strive to maintain a diverse client portfolio, which is intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk.
Apache primarily markets its U.S. crude oil to integrated major oil companies, marketing and transportation companies, and refiners based on a West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price, adjusted for quality, transportation and a market-reflective differential. The objective is to maximize the value of crude oil sold by identifying the best markets and most economical transportation routes available to move the product. Sales contracts are generally 30-day evergreen contracts that renew automatically until canceled by either party. These contracts provide for sales that are priced daily at prevailing market prices. Also, from time to time, the Company will enter into physical term sales contracts for durations up to five years. These term contracts typically have a firm transport commitment and often provide for the higher of prevailing market prices from multiple market hubs.
5 Table of Contents Apaches NGL production is sold under contracts with prices based on local supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.
Canada Overview Apache entered the Canadian market in 1995 and currently holds nearly 5.4million gross acres across the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. The regions large acreage position provides portfolio diversification as well as significant drilling opportunities. Our Canadian region provided approximately 14 percent of Apaches 2013 worldwide production.
In 2013, Apache drilled or participated in drilling 143 wells in Canada, with a continued focus on increasing oil and liquids-rich gas production. Reservoir modeling and horizontal drilling technology advanced several oil and liquids-rich gas plays in the Montney, Swan Hills, Viking, Bluesky, and Glauconite formations. Success with multi-stage fracture completions continues to increase the scope of oil and liquids-rich gas drilling opportunities.
We also furthered our regions shift toward an oil and liquids-rich gas asset portfolio through several strategic divestitures of primarily dry gas assets during 2013. In September we completed the sale of certain Alberta producing assets for approximately $214 million. The assets comprised 621,000 gross acres (530,000 net acres) and more than 2,700 wells in the Nevis, North Grant Lands, and South Grant Lands areas. In October 2013, we completed two additional sales of producing properties in Saskatchewan and Alberta for $112 million. The divested assets comprised approximately 4,000 operated and 1,300 non-operated wells, including our Hatton, St. Lina, Marten Hills, Snipe Lake, and Valhalla developments, as well as a portion of our Hawkeye producing properties. Combined, our 2013 divestitures totaled 13 percent of the regions production.
The Kitimat LNG project will allow us to monetize large unconventional natural gas resources in the Liard and Horn River basins in northern British Columbia. In February 2013, Apache completed a transaction with Chevron Canada Limited (Chevron Canada) under which each company became a 50 percent owner of the Kitimat LNG plant, the Pacific Trail Pipelines Limited Partnership (PTP), and 644,000 gross undeveloped acres in the Horn River and Liard basins. Chevron Canada will operate the LNG plant and pipeline while Apache Canada will continue to operate the upstream assets. The Kitimat plant has received all significant environmental approvals and a 20-year export license from the Canadian federal government. Although the project has not reached a final investment decision, we believe Chevrons experience in developing LNG projects and marketing expertise will assist in moving the development forward. In 2014, we plan to invest approximately $1.0 billion of capital in the Kitimat project, which includes the LNG plant as well as our upstream assets in the Horn River and Liard basins. With a 50 percent project participation, Apache is actively evaluating ways to right-size its level of participation in the Kitimat LNG project.
Additionally, the region plans to invest approximately $600 million in drilling and development projects, equipment upgrades, and production enhancement projects for our other upstream assets.
Marketing Our Canadian natural gas marketing activities focus on sales to utilities, end-users, integrated major oil companies, supply aggregators, and marketers. We maintain a diverse client portfolio, which is intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk in our portfolio. To diversify our market exposure, we transport natural gas under firm transportation contracts to delivery points into the United States. We sell the majority of our Canadian gas on a monthly basis at either first-of-the-month or daily AECO index prices. Also, from time to time, the Company will enter into fixed physical sales contracts for durations of up to one-year. These physical sales volumes are typically sold at fixed prices over the term of the contract.
Canadian crude oil production is sold to integrated major companies, refiners, and marketing companies based on a WTI price, adjusted for quality, transportation, and a market-reflective differential. The crude is transported by pipeline or truck within Western Canada to market hubs in Alberta and Manitoba where it is sold, allowing for a more diversified group of purchasers and a higher netback price. A portion of our trucked barrels 6 Table of Contents are delivered and sold at rail terminals. We evaluate our transport options monthly to maximize our netback prices.
The regions NGL production is sold under contracts with prices based on local supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.
International Apaches international assets are located in Egypt, Australia, offshore the U.K. in the North Sea, and Argentina. In 2013, international assets contributed 42 percent of our production and 50 percent of our oil and gas revenues. At year-end 2013, 32 percent of our estimated proved reserves were located outside North America.
Egypt Overview Our activity in Egypt began in 1994 with our first Qarun discovery well, and today we are one of the largest acreage holders in Egypts Western Desert. At year-end, we held 9.8million gross acres, with gross oil production of 198 Mb/d and gross natural gas production of 912 MMcf/d in 2013, or 90 Mb/d and 356 MMcf/d net to Apaches consolidated holdings. Although 3.0million gross undeveloped acres expired in January 2014, we continue to pursue longer term extensions on areas we believe provide attractive growth opportunities. Of our remaining acreage, 72 percent is undeveloped, providing us with considerable exploration and development opportunities for the future.
Our operations in Egypt are conducted pursuant to production-sharing agreements in 24 separate concessions, under which the contractor partners pay all operating and capital expenditure costs for exploration and development. Development leases within concessions currently have expiration dates ranging from 2 to 25 years, with extensions possible for additional commercial discoveries or on a negotiated basis. A percentage of the production on development leases, usually up to 40 percent, is available to the contractor partners to recover operating and capital expenditure costs, with the balance generally allocated between the contractor partners and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on a contractually defined basis. In 2013 Apache was granted 20 new development leases, representing one of our most successful years since our entry into Egypt.
Our growth in Egypt has been driven by an ongoing drilling program, and we have historically been one of the most active drillers in the Western Desert. During 2013, we drilled 181 development and injection wells and 54 exploration wells. Approximately 60 percent of our exploration wells were successful, further expanding our presence in the westernmost concessions and unlocking additional opportunities in existing plays. A key component of the regions success has been the ability to acquire and evaluate 3-D seismic surveys that enable our technical teams to consistently high-grade existing prospects and identify new targets across multiple pay horizons in the Cretaceous, Jurassic, and deeper Paleozoic formations.
Apache has also made a strategic decision to advance the application of horizontal drilling technology to unlock new plays in Egypt. During the year, we drilled our first well of a multi-well horizontal drilling program in the Abu Gharadig field. During December, this well produced an average of 1,681 b/d and 3 MMcf/d from a 1,970 foot lateral. This well was one of eight horizontal wells initiated during 2013 to test the technologys ability to increase recoveries in a variety of conventional and unconventional reservoirs. Additional horizontal drilling is planned in the Abu Gharadig and surrounding fields in 2014.
In November 2013, Apache announced the completion of the sale of a one-third minority interest in its Egypt oil and gas business to Sinopec. After customary closing adjustments, Apache received cash consideration of $2.95 billion. At year-end 2013, our Egypt regions estimated proved reserves were 271 MMboe, of which 90 7 Table of Contents MMboe is attributable to Sinopecs noncontrolling interest. Our estimated proved reserves in Egypt are reported under the economic interest method and exclude the host countrys share of reserves.
Heading into 2014, the region will continue an active drilling program and plans to invest approximately $1.4 billion, including approximately $460 million attributable to Sinopecs noncontrolling interest, for drilling, recompletion projects, development projects, and seismic acquisition.
Marketing Our gas production is sold to EGPC primarily under an industry-pricing formula, a sliding scale based on Dated Brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. The region averaged $2.99 per Mcf in 2013.
Oil from the Khalda Concession, the Qarun Concession, and other nearby Western Desert blocks is sold to third parties in the export market or to EGPC when called upon to supply domestic demand. Oil sales are exported from or sold at one of two terminals on the northern coast of Egypt. Oil production that is presently sold to EGPC is sold on a spot basis priced at Brent with a monthly EGPC official differential applied.
Egypt political unrest In February 2011, former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak stepped down, and the Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces took power, announcing that it would remain in power until presidential and parliamentary elections could be held. In June 2012, President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhoods Freedom and Justice Party was elected as Egypts new president.
In July 2013, the Egyptian military removed President Morsi from power and installed Egypts Chief Justice, Adly Mansour, as acting president of a temporary government, which announced that it would seek to schedule parliamentary and presidential elections in early to mid-2014. In January 2014, Egyptians voted on and overwhelmingly approved a new constitution, and Mr.Mansour announced that the presidential election will be held prior to the parliamentary elections. While the date of the presidential election has not been announced, it is expected to be held by mid-April 2014.
Apaches operations, located in remote locations in the Western Desert, have not experienced production interruptions, and we have continued to receive development lease approvals for our drilling program. However, a further deterioration in the political, economic, and social conditions or other relevant policies of the Egyptian government, such as changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions, expropriation of our assets or resource nationalization, and/or forced renegotiation or modification of our existing contracts with EGPC could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Apache purchases multi-year political risk insurance from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and other highly rated international insurers covering a portion of its investments in Egypt. In the aggregate, these insurance policies, subject to the policy terms and conditions, provide approximately $856 million of coverage to Apache for losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks, with a $149 million sub-limit for currency inconvertibility.
In addition, Apache has a separate policy with OPIC, which provides $300 million of coverage for losses arising from (1)non-payment by EGPC of arbitral awards covering amounts owed Apache on past due invoices and (2)expropriation of exportable petroleum in the event that actions taken by the government of Egypt prevent Apache from exporting our share of production. In October 2012, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), a member of the World Bank Group, announced that it was providing $150 million in reinsurance to OPIC for the remainder of the policy term. This provision of long-term reinsurance to OPIC will allow Apache to maintain the $300 million of insurance coverage through 2024.
Australia Overview Apaches holdings in Australia are focused offshore Western Australia in the Carnarvon, Exmouth, and Browse basins, with production operations in the Carnarvon and Exmouth basins. We have 8 Table of Contents operated in the Carnarvon basin since acquiring the gas processing facilities on Varanus Island and adjacent producing properties in 1993. In total, we control approximately 7.9million gross acres offshore Western Australia through 30 exploration permits, 18 production licenses, and 9 retention leases. Approximately 89 percent of our acreage is undeveloped, and the region continues to actively pursue additional acreage opportunities.
During 2013, the region had net production of 19 Mb/d and 223 MMcf/d, contributing 7 percent of Apaches worldwide consolidated production revenue, 7 percent of worldwide consolidated production and 12 percent of year-end consolidated proved reserves. Production compared to the prior year was 12 percent lower primarily as a result of natural decline in the Pyrenees and Van Gogh oil fields.
Partially offsetting production declines from Pyrenees and Van Gogh was production through the BHP Billiton-operated Macedon gas plant, which commenced operations in the third quarter of 2013. The $1.5 billion natural gas facility, Western Australias fourth domestic gas hub, has a production capacity of approximately 200 MMcf/d. Gas is delivered to the facility via a 60-mile pipeline from four completed subsea gas wells in the Macedon field. Apache has successfully marketed production in the Macedon field under long-term contracts at prices higher than historical realizations. We have a 28.57 percent non-operating working interest in the field and gas plant. Apache has a participating interest in three of the four domestic gas hubs in Australia.
The region participated in drilling 12 offshore wells during 2013, of which 4 were exploration or appraisal wells, compared to 15 wells drilled in 2012. Over the past decade, the regions exploration activity has established a significant pipeline of projects that are expected to contribute to production growth as they are brought online in the coming years.
Development of the Coniston oil field project, which lies just north of the Van Gogh field, continued toward projected first production in 2014. The field will be produced via subsea completions tied back to the Ningaloo Vision Floating Production Storage and Offloading Vessel (FPSO) at Van Gogh. Required modifications to the FPSO and the final phase of subsea installation work is planned for the first half of 2014. Apache has a 52.5 percent working interest in the field.
The region also continued development of the Balnaves field, an oil discovery located near the Brunello gas field. Development well drilling commenced in the third quarter of 2013, and the project is expected to begin production by the third quarter of 2014 utilizing a leased FPSO vessel. Apache has a 65 percent working interest in the project.
In 2013, further advances were made on the regions largest development effort, which is the Chevron-operated Wheatstone LNG project (Wheatstone). The first phase of the Wheatstone project will comprise two LNG processing trains with a combined capacity of approximately 8.9million metric tons per annum (mtpa), a domestic gas plant, and associated infrastructure. Apache has a 13 percent interest in the project and expects to invest approximately $4 billion over five years for the field and LNG facility development. Apache will supply gas to Wheatstone from its operated Julimar and Brunello complex. The 65 percent interest in the Julimar development project is expected to generate average net sales to Apache of approximately 140 MMcf/d of gas (equivalent to 1.07million mtpa of LNG) at prices pegged to world oil markets, 22 MMcf/d of sales gas into the domestic market, and 3,250 barrels of condensate per day. First production is projected for the end of 2016.
These development projects require significant capital investments above those for traditional drilling programs. During 2014, the region plans to invest approximately $800 million for drilling, recompletion projects, development projects, equipment upgrades, production enhancement projects, and seismic acquisition. Approximately $1.4 billion of additional 2014 capital will be invested in the Wheatstone development project.
Marketing Western Australia has historically had a local market for natural gas with a limited number of buyers and sellers resulting in sales under mostly long-term, fixed-price contracts, many of which contain 9 Table of Contents periodic price revision clauses based on either the Australian consumer price index or a commodity linkage. As of December31, 2013, Apache had 21 active gas contracts in Australia with expiration dates ranging from August 2014 to December 2026. Recent increases in demand and higher development costs have increased the prices required from the local market in order to support the development of new supplies. As a result, market prices negotiated on recent contracts are substantially higher than historical levels.
We directly market all of our Australian crude oil production into Australian domestic and international markets at prices generally indexed to Dated Brent benchmark crude oil prices plus premiums, which typically result in sales well above crude sold at WTI-based prices.
During 2013 Apache finalized binding Sales and Purchase Agreements with two Asian customers for the delivery of approximately 25 percent of Apaches net LNG offtake from Wheatstone.
North Sea Overview Apache entered the North Sea in 2003 after acquiring an approximate 97 percent working interest in the Forties field (Forties). Apache has actively invested in the region and has established a large inventory of drilling prospects through successful exploration programs and the interpretation of acquired 3-D and 4-D seismic data. Building upon its success in Forties, Apache in 2012 acquired Mobil North Sea Limited (Mobil North Sea), providing the region with additional exploration and development opportunities across numerous fields, including operated interests in the Beryl, Nevis, Nevis South, Skene, and Buckland fields and non-operated interests in the Maclure, Scott, and Telford fields. In total, Apache has interests in approximately 1.2million gross acres in the U.K. North Sea.
In 2013, the North Sea region produced 65 Mb/d and 51 MMcf/d, contributing 17 percent of Apaches worldwide consolidated production revenue, 10 percent of worldwide consolidated production, and 6 percent of year-end consolidated proved reserves. During the year we drilled 19 wells in the North Sea, of which 17 were productive. Apaches drilling success was highlighted with discoveries in the Tonto oil field. The Tonto-1 well, completed in April, had initial production of 10.3 Mb/d, and the Tonto-2 well, completed in September, had initial production of 8.3 Mb/d. Apache has a 100 percent working interest in the wells. The Tonto discovery follows Maule and Bacchus as the third new field brought online by Apache in the Forties area over the last three years. All three fields qualify for the U.K.s small field allowance, which provides economic incentives for operators to bring discoveries from small fields into production. During the fourth quarter the region continued to commission the Forties Alpha Satellite Platform, adjacent to the main Forties Alpha platform. This platform has been constructed to exploit new opportunities at Forties and provides an additional 18 drilling slots as well as power generation, fluid separation, and gas lift compression.
In 2014, the region plans to invest approximately $900 million on drilling, recompletion projects, development projects, equipment upgrades, production enhancement projects, and seismic acquisition, focusing on both the Beryl field and Forties area.
Marketing We have traditionally sold our North Sea crude oil under both term contracts and spot cargoes. The Forties term sales are composed of a market-based index price plus a premium, which reflects the higher market value for term arrangements. The prices received for Beryl spot cargoes are market driven and can trade at a premium to the market-based index.
Natural gas from the Beryl field is processed through the SAGE gas plant operated by Apache. The gas is sold to a third party at the St. Fergus entry point of the national grid on a National Balancing Point index price basis. The condensate mix from the SAGE plant is processed further downstream. The split streams of propane and butane are sold on a monthly entitlement basis, and condensate is sold on a spot basis at the Braefoot Bay terminal using index pricing less transportation.
10 Table of Contents Argentina Overview We have had a continuous presence in Argentina since 2001 and have grown our holdings in the region through an active drilling program and targeted acquisitions. The region has active operations in the provinces of Neuqun, Rio Negro, and Tierra del Fuego. As of year-end 2013, Apache held interests in 31 concessions, exploration permits, and other interests totaling 3.3million gross acres in three of the main Argentine hydrocarbon basins: Neuqun, Austral, and Cuyo. These concessions have varying expiration dates ranging from one year to over 15 years remaining, subject to potential extensions. In 2013, Argentina produced 6 percent of our worldwide consolidated production and held 4 percent of our year-end consolidated proved reserves.
On February12, 2014, Apache announced an agreement to sell all of its operations in Argentina to YPF for cash consideration of $800 million plus the assumption of $52 million of bank debt as of June30, 2013. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014.
Marketing Natural Gas Apache sells its natural gas in Argentina through three different pricing structures:  Gas Plus Program: This program was instituted by the Argentine government in 2008 to encourage investments for new gas supplies through the development of conventional and unconventional (tight sands) reserves. Under this program, Apache is allowed to sell gas from qualifying projects at prices that are above the regulated rates. During 2013, the average Gas Plus volume sold by Apache was 79.9 MMcf/d at an average price of $4.90 per Mcf.
Government-regulated pricing: The volumes we are required to sell at regulated prices are set by the Argentine government and vary based on seasonal factors and category. During 2013, we realized an average price of $0.78 per Mcf on government-regulated sales.
Unregulated market: In 2013, realizations on sales in the unregulated market averaged $3.69 per Mcf.
In 2013, we realized an average price of $2.96 per Mcf in the region.
Crude Oil The crude oil in Argentina is subject to an export tax which effectively limits the prices buyers are willing to pay for domestic sales. In 2013 there was an increase on the price of the crude paid by refiners, a combination of an increase of the sales price of fuels to end-users and the decrease of domestic production. Apaches average sales price in Argentina during 2013 was $79.05 per barrel.
Other Exploration New Ventures Apaches global New Ventures team provides exposure to new growth opportunities by looking outside of the Companys traditional core areas and targeting higher-risk, high-reward exploration opportunities located in frontier basins as well as new plays in more mature basins. During 2014, we plan to invest approximately $75 million to further several projects and continue pursuing additional exploration opportunities.
Major Customers In 2013, 2012, and 2011 purchases by Royal Dutch Shell plc and its subsidiaries accounted for 24 percent, 20 percent, and 11 percent, respectively, of the Companys worldwide oil and gas production revenues. In 2011, purchases by the Vitol Group accounted for 13 percent of the Companys worldwide oil and gas production revenues.
11 Table of Contents Drilling Statistics Worldwide in 2013 we participated in drilling 1,591 gross wells, with 1,520 (96 percent) completed as producers. Historically, our drilling activities in the U.S. have generally concentrated on exploitation and extension of existing producing fields rather than exploration. As a general matter, our operations outside of the U.S. focus on a mix of exploration and development wells. In addition to our completed wells, at year-end a number of wells had not yet reached completion: 160 in the U.S. (115.4 net); 17 in Egypt (17.0 net); and 2 in Argentina (0.3 net).

Additionally, Apache has 2.7million and 1.9million net undeveloped acres set to expire in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We strive to extend the terms of many of these licenses and concession areas through operational or administrative actions, but cannot assure that such extensions can be achieved on an economic basis or otherwise on terms agreeable to both the Company and third parties including governments.
Exploration concessions in our Egypt region comprise a significant portion of our net undeveloped acreage expiring over the next three years. We have 1.5million net acres in Egypt scheduled to expire in 2014, and 1.0million and 0.9million net undeveloped acres set to expire in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Nearly all of the acreage expiring in 2014 was relinquished in January. There were no reserves recorded on this undeveloped acreage. Apache will continue to pursue acreage extensions in areas in which it believes exploration opportunities exist and over the past year has been successful in being awarded six-month extensions on targeted concessions. Longer term extensions are also being finalized with EGPC.
As of December31, 2013, 23 percent of U.S. net undeveloped acreage and 54 percent of Canadian undeveloped acreage was held by production.
Estimated Proved Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations. Estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production-sharing arrangements utilizing the economic interest method, which excludes the host countrys share of reserves.
Estimated reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques are included in the proved classification when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of an active, improved recovery program using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty for the engineering analysis on which the project or program is based. Economically producible means a resource that generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the operation. Reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field-tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In estimating its proved reserves, Apache uses several different traditional methods that can be classified in three general categories: (1)performance-based methods; (2)volumetric-based methods; and (3)analogy with similar properties. Apache will, at times, utilize additional technical analysis, such as computer reservoir models, petrophysical techniques, and proprietary 3-D seismic interpretation methods, to provide additional support for more complex reservoirs. Information from this additional analysis is combined with traditional methods outlined above to enhance the certainty of our reserve estimates.
Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time period.
14 Table of Contents The following table shows proved oil, NGL, and gas reserves as of December31, 2013, based on average commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month in 2013, held flat for the life of the production, except where future oil and gas sales are covered by physical contract terms. This table shows reserves on a boe basis in which natural gas is converted to an equivalent barrel of oil based on a 6:1 energy equivalent ratio. This ratio is not reflective of the current price ratio between the two products.

Combined, these total estimated proved reserves are the energy equivalent of 2.65 billion barrels of oil or 15.9 Tcf of natural gas, of which oil represents 43 percent. As of December31, 2013, the Companys proved developed reserves totaled 1,833 MMboe and estimated PUD reserves totaled 813 MMboe, or approximately 31 percent of worldwide total proved reserves. Apache has elected not to disclose probable or possible reserves in this filing.
The Companys estimates of proved reserves, proved developed reserves and PUD reserves as of December31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three years, and estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are contained in Note 14Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item15 of this Form 10-K. Estimated future net cash flows were calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum, end of period costs, and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves The Companys total estimated PUD reserves of 813 MMboe as of December31, 2013, decreased by 57 MMboe from 870 MMboe of PUD reserves estimated at the end of 2012. During the year, Apache converted 154 MMboe of PUD reserves to proved developed reserves through development drilling activity. In North America, we converted 124 MMboe, with the remaining 30 MMboe in our international areas. We sold 109 MMboe and acquired 1 MMboe of PUD reserves during the year. We added 205 MMboe of new PUD reserves through extensions and discoveries.
15 Table of Contents During the year, a total of approximately $3.7 billion was spent on projects associated with reserves that were carried as PUD reserves at the end of 2012. A portion of our costs incurred each year relate to development projects that will be converted to proved developed reserves in future years. We spent $2.1 billion on PUD reserve development activity in North America and $1.6 billion in the international areas. Other than our Julimar/Brunello development project, which is tied to the construction schedule of the Wheatstone LNG project, with projected first production in 2016, we had no material amounts of PUD reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more after they were initially disclosed as PUD reserves and no material amounts of PUD reserves which are scheduled to be developed beyond five years from December31, 2013.
Preparation of Oil and Gas Reserve Information Apaches reported reserves are reasonably certain estimates which, by their very nature, are subject to revision. These estimates are reviewed throughout the year and revised either upward or downward, as warranted.
Apaches proved reserves are estimated at the property level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized group of experienced reservoir engineers that is independent of the operating groups. These engineers interact with engineering and geoscience personnel in each of Apaches operating areas and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain the necessary data for projecting future production, costs, net revenues, and ultimate recoverable reserves. All relevant data is compiled in a computer database application, to which only authorized personnel are given security access rights consistent with their assigned job function. Reserves are reviewed internally with senior management and presented to Apaches Board of Directors in summary form on a quarterly basis. Annually, each property is reviewed in detail by our corporate and operating region engineers to ensure forecasts of operating expenses, netback prices, production trends, and development timing are reasonable.
Apaches Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir Engineering is the person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our internal reserve estimates and for coordinating any reserves audits conducted by a third-party engineering firm. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering and over 30 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility within Apaches corporate reservoir engineering department. The Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir Engineering reports directly to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
The estimate of reserves disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is prepared by the Companys internal staff, and the Company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of those estimates. However, the Company engages Ryder Scott Company, L.P. Petroleum Consultants (Ryder Scott) to review our processes and the reasonableness of our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves. Apache selects the properties for review by Ryder Scott based primarily on relative reserve value. We also consider other factors such as geographic location, new wells drilled during the year and reserves volume. During 2013, the properties selected for each country ranged from 83 to 100 percent of the total future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent. These properties also accounted for over 86 percent of the reserves value of our international proved reserves and of the new wells drilled in each country. In addition, all fields containing five percent or more of the Companys total proved reserves volume were included in Ryder Scotts review. The review covered 86 percent of total proved reserves, including 89 percent of proved developed reserves and 79 percent of PUD reserves.
During 2013, 2012, and 2011, Ryder Scotts review covered 92, 88, and 81 percent, respectively, of the Companys worldwide estimated proved reserves value and 86, 83, and 70 percent, respectively, of the Companys total proved reserves volume. Ryder Scotts review of 2013 covered 84 percent of U.S., 82 percent of Canada, 63 percent of Argentina, 99 percent of Australia, 88 percent of Egypt, and 88 percent of the U.K.s total proved reserves. Ryder Scotts review of 2012 covered 81 percent of U.S., 78 percent of Canada, 64 percent of Argentina, 99 percent of Australia, 84 percent of Egypt, and 88 percent of the U.K.s total proved reserves. Ryder Scotts review of 2011 covered 68 percent of U.S., 69 percent of Canada, 58 percent of Argentina, 99 percent of Australia, 62 percent of Egypt, and 61 percent of the U.K.s total proved reserves. We have filed Ryder Scotts independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.
16 Table of Contents According to Ryder Scotts opinion, based on their review, including the data, technical processes, and interpretations presented by Apache, the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Apache in determining the proved reserves comply with the current SEC regulations, and the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by Apache are, in aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines as set forth in the Society of Petroleum Engineers auditing standards.
Employees On December31, 2013, we had 5,342 employees.
Offices Our principal executive offices are located at One Post Oak Central, 2000 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 100, Houston, Texas 77056-4400. At year-end 2013, we maintained regional exploration and/or production offices in Midland, Texas; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Houston, Texas; Calgary, Alberta; Cairo, Egypt; Perth, Western Australia; Aberdeen, Scotland; and Buenos Aires, Argentina. Apache leases all of its primary office space. The current lease on our principal executive offices runs through December31, 2018. For information regarding the Companys obligations under its office leases, please see Part II, Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCapital Resources and LiquidityContractual Obligations and Note 8Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item15 of this Form 10-K.
Title to Interests As is customary in our industry, a preliminary review of title records, which may include opinions or reports of appropriate professionals or counsel, is made at the time we acquire properties. We believe that our title to all of the various interests set forth above is satisfactory and consistent with the standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry, subject only to immaterial exceptions that do not detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in our operations. The interests owned by us may be subject to one or more royalty, overriding royalty, or other outstanding interests (including disputes related to such interests) customary in the industry. The interests may additionally be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and orders of arbitral or governmental authorities. In addition, the interests may be subject to burdens such as production payments, net profits interests, liens incident to operating agreements and current taxes, development obligations under oil and gas leases, and other encumbrances, easements, and restrictions, none of which detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in our operations.
Additional Information about Apache In this section, references to we, us, our, and Apache include Apache Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise specifically stated.
Remediation Plans and Procedures Apache and its wholly owned subsidiary, Apache Deepwater LLC (ADW), developed Oil Spill Response Plans (the Plans) for their respective Gulf of Mexico operations to ensure rapid and effective responses to spill events that may occur on such entities operated properties as required by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) 30 CFR 254.30. Annually, drills are conducted to measure and maintain the effectiveness of the Plans. These drills include the participation of spill response contractors, representatives of Clean Gulf Associates (CGA), and representatives of governmental agencies. In the event of a spill, CGA is the primary oil spill response association available to Apache and ADW. Apache and ADW have received approval for the Plans from BSEE. Apache and ADW personnel each review their respective Plan biennially and update where necessary.
17 Table of Contents Both Apache and ADW are members of CGA, a not-for-profit association of producing and pipeline companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico. CGA was created to provide a means of effectively staging response equipment and providing immediate spill response for its member companies operations in the Gulf of Mexico. In the event of a spill, CGAs equipment, which is positioned at various staging points around the Gulf, is ready to be mobilized. In addition, CGA has contracted with Airborne Support Inc. to provide aircraft and dispersant capabilities for CGA member companies. In 2013, Apache incurred charges for CGA of approximately $700,000 based on a per-member fee and annual production.
In the event that CGA resources are already being utilized, other resources are available to Apache. Apache is a member of Oil Spill Response Limited (OSRL), which entitles any Apache entity worldwide to access OSRLs service. OSRL has access to resources from the Global Response Network, a collaboration of seven major oil industry funded spill response organizations worldwide. If necessary, OSRLs resources may be, and have been, deployed to areas across the globe, including the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, in February 2012, ADW became a member of Marine Spill Response Corporation (MSRC) and National Response Corporation (NRC), and their resources are available to ADW for its deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations. Furthermore, the spill response resources of other organizations are also available to both Apache and ADW as non-members, albeit at a higher cost. MSRC has an extensive inventory of oil spill response equipment, independent of and in addition to CGAs equipment. MSRC has contracts in place with over 100 environmental contractors around the country, in addition to hundreds of other companies that provide support services during spill response. In the event of a spill, MSRC will activate these contractors as necessary to provide additional resources or support services requested by its customers. NRC owns a variety of equipment, currently including shallow water portable barges, boom, high capacity skimming systems, inland workboats, vacuum transfer units, and mobile communication centers. NRC has access to hundreds of offshore vessels and supply boats worldwide. The equipment and resources available to MSRC and NRC changes from time to time, and current information is generally available on each companys website. In 2013, Apaches Gulf of Mexico Deepwater region incurred charges for NRC of $12,248 based on annual production and charges for MSRC of approximately $1.4 million based on annual production and total wells spud during the year.
An Apache subsidiary is also a member of the Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC) to help the Company fulfill the governments permit requirements for containment and oil spill response plans in deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations. MWCC is a not-for-profit, stand-alone organization whose goal is to improve capabilities for containing an underwater well control incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Members and their affiliates have access to MWCCs extensive containment network and systems. As of December31, 2013, Apaches investment in MWCC totals approximately $136 million.
Apache also participates in a number of industry-wide task forces that are studying ways to better access and control blowouts in subsea environments and increase containment and recovery methods. Two such task forces are the Subsea Well Control and Containment Task Force and the Offshore Operating Procedures Task Force.
Competitive Conditions The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisitions of reserves, the acquisition of oil and gas leases, equipment and personnel required to find and produce reserves, and in the gathering and marketing of oil, gas, and natural gas liquids. Our competitors include national oil companies, major integrated oil and gas companies, other independent oil and gas companies, and participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.
Certain of our competitors may possess financial or other resources substantially larger than we possess or have established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for leases or drilling rights.
18 Table of Contents However, we believe our diversified portfolio of core assets, which comprises large acreage positions and well-established production bases across six countries, and our balanced production mix between oil and gas, our management and incentive systems, and our experienced personnel give us a strong competitive position relative to many of our competitors who do not possess similar geographic and production diversity. Our global position provides a large inventory of geologic and geographic opportunities in the six countries in which we have producing operations to which we can reallocate capital investments in response to changes in commodity prices, local business environments, and markets. It also reduces the risk that we will be materially impacted by an event in a specific area or country.
Environmental Compliance As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties and facilities, we are subject to numerous federal, provincial, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Although environmental requirements have a substantial impact upon the energy industry, as a whole, we do not believe that these requirements affect us differently, to any material degree, than other companies in our industry.
We have made and will continue to make expenditures in our efforts to comply with these requirements, which we believe are necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry. We have established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including regulations applicable to our operations in all countries in which we do business. We have established operating procedures and training programs designed to limit the environmental impact of our field facilities and identify and comply with changes in existing laws and regulations. The costs incurred under these policies and procedures are inextricably connected to normal operating expenses such that we are unable to separate expenses related to environmental matters; however, we do not believe expenses related to training and compliance with regulations and laws that have been adopted or enacted to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment will have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
19 Table of Contents ITEM1A.
RISK FACTORS Our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant hazards and risks, including those described below. If any of such events should occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity, and/or results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. Additional risks relating to our securities may be included in the prospectuses for securities we issue in the future.
Future economic conditions in the U.S. and certain international markets may materially adversely impact our operating results.
The U.S. and other world economies continue to recover from the global financial crisis and recession that began in 2008. Growth has resumed but is modest and at an unsteady rate. The continuation of current global market conditions, uncertainty or further deterioration, including the economic instability in Europe and certain emerging markets, is likely to have significant long-term effects, including a future global economic growth rate that is slower than in the years leading up to the crisis, and more volatility may occur before any sustainable growth rate is achieved. Global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including fossil fuels. A lower future economic growth rate could result in decreased demand growth for our crude oil and natural gas production as well as lower commodity prices, which would reduce our cash flows from operations and our profitability.
Crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile, and a substantial reduction in these prices could adversely affect our results and the price of our common stock.
Our revenues, operating results, and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production. Historically, the markets for crude oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. For example, the NYMEX daily settlement price for the prompt month oil contract in 2013 ranged from a high of $110.53 per barrel to a low of $86.68 per barrel. The NYMEX daily settlement price for the prompt month natural gas contract in 2013 ranged from a high of $4.46 per MMBtu to a low of $3.11 per MMBtu. The market prices for crude oil and natural gas depend on factors beyond our control. These factors include demand for crude oil and natural gas, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions, and other factors, including:  worldwide and domestic supplies of crude oil and natural gas;  actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations;  political conditions and events (including instability, changes in governments, or armed conflict) in crude oil or natural gas producing regions;  the level of global crude oil and natural gas inventories;  the price and level of imported foreign crude oil and natural gas;  the price and availability of alternative fuels, including coal and biofuels;  the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure;  the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity;  weather conditions;  electricity generation;  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and  the overall economic environment.
Significant declines in crude oil and natural gas prices for an extended period may have the following effects on our business:  limiting our financial condition, liquidity, and/or ability to fund planned capital expenditures and operations; 20 Table of Contents  reducing the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we can produce economically;  causing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects;  reducing our revenues, operating income, and cash flows;  limiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt;  a reduction in the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties; or  a reduction in the carrying value of goodwill.
Our ability to sell natural gas or oil and/or receive market prices for our natural gas or oil may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints and various transportation interruptions.
A portion of our natural gas and oil production in any region may be interrupted, limited, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or capital constraints that limit the ability of third parties to construct gathering systems, processing facilities, or interstate pipelines to transport our production, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flows.
Weather and climate may have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and productivity.
Demand for oil and natural gas are, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impact the price we receive for the commodities we produce. In addition, our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather, such as freezing temperatures, hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, storms in the North Sea, or cyclones offshore Australia, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment. Our planning for normal climatic variation, insurance programs, and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather conditions, and not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated, or insured against.
Our operations involve a high degree of operational risk, particularly risk of personal injury, damage, or loss of equipment, and environmental accidents.
Our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production, and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, including:  well blowouts, explosions, and cratering;  pipeline or other facility ruptures and spills;  fires;  formations with abnormal pressures;  equipment malfunctions;  hurricanes, storms, and/or cyclones, which could affect our operations in areas such as on- and offshore the Gulf Coast, North Sea, and Australia, and other natural disasters and weather conditions; and  surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents, saltwater, or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives.
Failure or loss of equipment as the result of equipment malfunctions, cyber attacks, or natural disasters such as hurricanes, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution and other damages for which we could be liable. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as a well blowout, explosion, or fire at a location where our equipment and services are used, or ground water contamination from hydraulic 21 Table of Contents fracturing chemical additives may result in substantial claims for damages. Ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture, or surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses. If a significant amount of our production is interrupted, our containment efforts prove to be ineffective or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, our cash flows, and, in turn, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
Cyber attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may adversely impact our operations.
Our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development and production activities.We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, and communicate with our employees and third party partners.Unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruptions in our exploration or production operations. Also, computers control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution systems in the United States and abroad, which are necessary to transport our production to market. A cyber attack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions.
While we have experienced cyber attacks, we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future.Further, as cyber attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyber attacks.
The additional deepwater drilling laws and regulations, delays in the processing and approval of permits and other related developments in the Gulf of Mexico as well as our other locations resulting from the Deepwater Horizon incident could adversely affect Apaches business.
In response to the Deepwater Horizon incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in April 2010, and as directed by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) issued new guidelines and regulations regarding safety, environmental matters, drilling equipment, and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. These new regulations have imposed additional requirements with respect to development and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico and have delayed the approval of applications to drill in both deepwater and shallow-water areas.
Further, at this time, we cannot predict with any certainty what further impact, if any, the Deepwater Horizon incident may have on the regulation of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activity, or on the cost or availability of insurance coverage to cover the risks of such operations. The enactment of new or stricter regulations in the United States and other countries and increased liability for companies operating in this sector could adversely affect Apaches operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as well as in our other locations.
Our commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose us to other risks.
To the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines, we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. In addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:  our production falls short of the hedged volumes;  there is a widening of price-basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement; 22 Table of Contents  the counterparties to our hedging or other price risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements; or  an unexpected event materially impacts oil and natural gas prices.
The credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect us.
We have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, other investment funds, and other institutions. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. We have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with our hedges and insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies. In addition, if any lender under our credit facility is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lenders commitment under our credit facility.
We are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our receivables.
We are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, joint interest billing, and other receivables. We sell our crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs to a variety of purchasers. As operator, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. Some of our purchasers and non-operating partners may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations. Nonperformance by a trade creditor or non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses.
A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.
We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the United States. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, and commodity pricing levels and others are also considered by the rating agencies. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require us to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations.
Market conditions may restrict our ability to obtain funds for future development and working capital needs, which may limit our financial flexibility.
The credit markets are subject to fluctuation and are vulnerable to unpredictable shocks. We have a significant development project inventory and an extensive exploration portfolio, which will require substantial future investment. We and/or our partners may need to seek financing in order to fund these or other future activities. Our future access to capital, as well as that of our partners and contractors, could be limited if the debt or equity markets are constrained. This could significantly delay development of our property interests.
Our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations.
The payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which considers, among other factors, our operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations, and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions. Our board of directors is not required to declare dividends on our common stock and may decide not to declare dividends.
Any indentures and other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock, including common stock. In addition, under Delaware law, dividends on capital stock may only be paid from surplus, which is defined as the amount by which our total assets exceeds 23 Table of Contents the sum of our total liabilities, including contingent liabilities, and the amount of our capital; if there is no surplus, cash dividends on capital stock may only be paid from our net profits for the then current and/or the preceding fiscal year. Further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law to pay cash dividends on common stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends in cash on our common stock.
Discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production.
The production rate from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted, while related per-unit production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. Therefore, unless we add reserves through exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones, secondary recovery reserves, or tertiary recovery reserves, or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, our estimated proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced. Future oil and gas production is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. Furthermore, if oil or gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves could also increase.
We may not realize an adequate return on wells that we drill.
Drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. The wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. The costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including, but not limited to:  unexpected drilling conditions;  pressure or irregularities in formations;  equipment failures or accidents;  fires, explosions, blowouts, and surface cratering;  marine risks such as capsizing, collisions, and hurricanes;  other adverse weather conditions; and  increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs and equipment.
Future drilling activities may not be successful, and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. While all drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.
Material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events or costs may affect the completion and commencement of production from development projects.
We are involved in several large development projects and the completion of these projects may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion dates. Our projects may be delayed by project approvals from joint venture partners, timely issuances of permits and licenses by governmental agencies, weather conditions, manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment, and other unforeseen events. Delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may adversely affect our large development projects and our ability to participate in large-scale development projects in the future. In addition, our estimates of future development costs are based on current expectation of prices and other costs of equipment and personell we will need to 24 Table of Contents implement such projects. Our actual future development costs may be significantly higher than we currently estimate. If costs become too high, our development projects may become uneconomic to us and we may be forced to abandon such development projects.
We may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves.
Although we perform a review of properties that we acquire that we believe is consistent with industry practices, such reviews are inherently incomplete. It generally is not feasible to review in-depth every individual property involved in each acquisition. Ordinarily, we will focus our review efforts on the higher-value properties and will sample the remainder. However, even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us as a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully and accurately their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, we often assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. In addition, there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon our operating results, particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into our ongoing operations.
The BP Acquisition and/or our liabilities could be adversely affected in the event one or more of the BP entities become the subject of a bankruptcy case.
In light of the extensive costs and liabilities related to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, there has been public speculation as to whether one or more of the BP entities could become the subject of a case or proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other relevant insolvency law or similar law (which we collectively refer to as Insolvency Laws). In the event that one or more of the BP entities were to become the subject of such a case or proceeding, a court may find that the three definitive purchase and sale agreements (the BP Purchase Agreements) we entered into in connection with our 2010 acquisition of properties from BP (the BP Properties) are executory contracts, in which case such BP entities may, subject to relevant Insolvency Laws, have the right to reject the agreements and refuse to perform their future obligations under them. In this event, our ability to enforce our rights under the BP Purchase Agreements could be adversely affected.
Additionally, in a case or proceeding under relevant Insolvency Laws, a court may find that the sale of the BP Properties constitutes a constructive fraudulent conveyance that should be set aside. While the tests for determining whether a transfer of assets constitutes a constructive fraudulent conveyance vary among jurisdictions, such a determination generally requires that the seller received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer or obligation and the seller was insolvent at the time of the transaction, or was rendered insolvent or left with unreasonably small capital to meet its anticipated business needs as a result of the transaction. The applicable time periods for such a finding also vary among jurisdictions, but generally range from two to six years. If a court were to make such a determination in a proceeding under relevant Insolvency Laws, our rights under the BP Purchase Agreements, and our rights to the BP Properties, could be adversely affected.
Crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates, and actual recoveries may vary significantly.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves and their value. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Because of the high degree of judgment involved, the accuracy of any reserve estimate is inherently imprecise, and a function of the quality of available data and the engineering 25 Table of Contents and geological interpretation. Our reserves estimates are based on 12-month average prices, except where contractual arrangements exist; therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease. In addition, results of drilling, testing, and production may substantially change the reserve estimates for a given reservoir over time. The estimates of our proved reserves and estimated future net revenues also depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including:  historical production from the area compared with production from other areas;  the effects of regulations by governmental agencies, including changes to severance and excise taxes;  future operating costs and capital expenditures; and  workover and remediation costs.
For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. Accordingly, reserves estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment, and actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates.
Additionally, because some of our reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history. Volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. In addition, realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans. A change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved.
Certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.
A sizeable portion of our acreage is currently undeveloped. Unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. If our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. Our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling, and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals.
We may incur significant costs related to environmental matters.
As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to various federal, provincial, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up and other remediation activities resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution and other damages, limit or constrain operations in affected areas, and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Our efforts to limit our exposure to such liability and cost may prove inadequate and result in significant adverse effects to our results of operations. In addition, it is possible that the increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require us to make significant capital expenditures. Such capital expenditures could adversely impact our cash flows and our financial condition.
Our North American operations are subject to governmental risks that may impact our operations.
Our North American operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, 26 Table of Contents changes in taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering rate controls, and environmental protection laws and regulations. New political developments, laws, and regulations may adversely impact our results of operations.
Pending regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact our business.
Several countries where we operate, including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom either tax or assess some form of greenhouse gas (GHG) related fees on our operations. Exposure has not been material to date, although a change in existing regulations could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.
In the event the predictions for rising temperatures and sea levels suggested by reports of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change do transpire, we do not believe those events by themselves are likely to impact our assets or operations. However, any increase in severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our assets and operations.
The proposed U.S. federal budget for fiscal year 2014, when released, is expected to include certain provisions that, if passed, will have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
To date, the Office of Management and Budget has not released a summary of the proposed U.S. federal budget for fiscal year 2014. It is anticipated that the proposed budget may recommend the repeal of many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by U.S. oil and gas companies. These provisions could include the elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred; increases in the taxation of foreign source income; repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and natural gas companies; and an increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers. Should some or all of these provisions become law, our taxes will increase, potentially significantly, which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows. This could also cause us to reduce our drilling activities in the U.S. Since none of these proposals have been voted on or become law, we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business.
Derivatives regulation included in current or proposed financial legislation and rulemaking could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices.
The Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law in July 2010, contains significant derivatives regulation, includinga requirement thatcertain transactionsbe cleared on exchanges anda requirement to post collateral (commonly referred to asmargin) forsuch transactions. The Act provides for a potential exception from these clearing and collateral requirements for commercial end-users and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions andthe parties to those transactions. We expect to qualify as a commercial end-user. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodities Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) has promulgated numerous rules to define these terms. In addition, it is possible that the CFTC, in conjunction with prudential regulators, may mandate that financial counterparties entering into swap transactions with end-users must do so with credit support agreements in place, which could result in negotiated credit thresholds above which an end-user must post collateral.
We use derivative instruments with respect to a portion of our expected crude oil and natural gas production in order to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations and enhance the stability of cash flows to support our capital investment programs and acquisitions. Given our current investment grade status, our current derivative contracts do not require the posting of margin regardless of the size of our liability positions.
Depending on the rules and definitions adopted by the CFTC and prudential regulators, we could be required to post significant amounts of collateral with our dealer counterparties for derivative transactions. Requirements to post cash collateral could result in negative impacts on our liquidity and financial flexibility and 27 Table of Contents also cause us to incur additional debt and/or reduce capital investment.In addition, the final CFTC rules may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to move some of their derivative activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty.
Proposed federal, state, or local regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our operating and capital costs.
Several proposals are before the U.S. Congress that, if implemented, would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Several states are considering legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting, transparency, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. Hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts, including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to earthquakes. In addition, some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing, or are considering doing so. We routinely use fracturing techniques in the U.S. and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the wellbore. It is typically done at substantial depths in very tight formations.
Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the legislation regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal, state, or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the U.S.
A deterioration of conditions in Egypt or changes in the economic and political environment in Egypt could have an adverse impact on our business.
In February 2011, the former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak stepped down, and the Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces took power, announcing that it would remain in power until the presidential and parliamentary elections could be held. In June 2012, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhoods Freedom and Justice Party was elected as Egypts new president. In July 2013, the Egyptian military removed President Morsi from power and installed Egypts Chief Justice, Adly Mansour, as acting president of a temporary government, which is seeking to set a schedule for new parliamentary and presidential elections in 2014. In January 2014, Egyptians voted on and overwhelmingly approved a new constitution, and Mr.Mansour announced that the presidential election will be held prior to the parliamentary elections. While the date of the presidential election has not been announced, it is expected to be held by mid-April 2014. Deterioration in the political, economic, and social conditions or other relevant policies of the Egyptian government, such as changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions, expropriation of our assets or resource nationalization, and/or forced renegotiation or modification of our existing contracts with EGPC could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our operations in Egypt contributed 19 percent of our 2013 production and accounted for 10 percent of our year-end estimated proved reserves. At year-end 2013, 18 percent of our estimated discounted future net cash flows and 8 percent of our net capitalized oil and gas property was attributable to Egypt. These totals reflect our consolidated interests in Egypt including Sinopecs one-third noncontrolling interest.
International operations have uncertain political, economic, and other risks.
Our operations outside North America are based primarily in Egypt, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Argentina. On a barrel equivalent basis, approximately 42 percent of our 2013 production was outside North America, and approximately 32 percent of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves on December31, 2013 were located outside North America. As a result, a significant portion of our production and resources are subject to the increased political and economic risks and other factors associated with international operations including, but not limited to:  general strikes and civil unrest; 28 Table of Contents  the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation and resource nationalization, forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts;  import and export regulations;  taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions;  price control;  transportation regulations and tariffs;  constrained natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area;  exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluation, or other activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of funds;  laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, including trade sanctions;  the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we currently operate;  the possible inability to subject foreign persons, especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies, to the jurisdiction of courts in the United States; and  difficulties in enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations.
Foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes. If a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to us by another country, our interests could decrease in value or be lost. Even our smaller international assets may affect our overall business and results of operations by distracting managements attention from our more significant assets. Certain regions of the world in which we operate have a history of political and economic instability. This instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investments such as ours. In an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of our assets. This could adversely affect our interests and our future profitability.
The impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities may have on the oil and gas industry in general, and on our operations in particular, is not known at this time. Uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, production facilities, processing plants, and refineries, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror or war. We may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities.
Our operations are sensitive to currency rate fluctuations.
Our operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, and the British Pound. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies.
We face strong industry competition that may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.
Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas exploration and production industry. We compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisition of oil and gas leases, properties, and reserves, equipment, and labor required to explore, develop, and operate those properties, and 29 Table of Contents marketing of oil and natural gas production. Crude oil and natural gas prices impact the costs of properties available for acquisition and the number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities. Many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than we possess and have established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as fluctuating worldwide commodity prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels, and the application of government regulations. We also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and other specialists. These competitive pressures may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.
Our insurance policies do not cover all of the risks we face, which could result in significant financial exposure.
Exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other events such as blowouts, cratering, fire and explosion and loss of well control, which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property and the environment. Our international operations are also subject to political risk. The insurance coverage that we maintain against certain losses or liabilities arising from our operations may be inadequate to cover any such resulting liability; moreover, insurance is not available to us against all operational risks.

As of January31, 2014, there were 394,724,983 shares of our common stock outstanding held by approximately 5,000 stockholders of record and 313,000 beneficial owners.
We have paid cash dividends on our common stock for 49 consecutive years through December31, 2013. In the first quarter of 2014 the Board of Directors approved a 25 percent increase to $0.25 per share for the regular quarterly cash dividend on the Companys common shares. This increase will apply to the dividend on common shares payable on May22, 2014, to stockholders of record on April22, 2014, and subsequent dividends paid. When, and if, declared by our Board of Directors, future dividend payments will depend upon our level of earnings, financial requirements, and other relevant factors.
On July28, 2010, Apache issued 25.3million depositary shares, each representing a 1/20th interest in a share of Apaches 6.00-percent Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series D (Preferred Share), or 1.265million Preferred Shares. Upon conversion of the outstanding Preferred Shares on August1, 2013, 14.4million Apache common shares were issued.
In 1995, under our stockholder rights plan, each of our common stockholders received a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right (a Right) for each 2.310 outstanding shares of common stock (adjusted for subsequent stock dividends and a two-for-one stock split) that the stockholder owned. These Rights were originally scheduled to expire on January31, 2006. Effective as of that date, the Rights were reset to one right per share of common stock, and the expiration was extended to January31, 2016.
On February5, 2014, the Companys Board of Directors voted to terminate the Companys stockholder rights plan. As a result of this decision, the Board approved an amendment to the Rights Agreement that will have the effect of terminating the Rights. The amendment will change the expiration date to March7, 2014, and, thereby, accelerate the expiration of the Rights. The Company expects that the amendment will be fully executed on March7, 2014.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. We currently have exploration and production interests in six countries: the U.S., Canada, Egypt, Australia, the U.K. North Sea, and Argentina. Apache also pursues exploration interests in other countries that may over time result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities.
The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in PartIV, Item15, and the risk factors and related information set forth in PartI, Item1A, and Part II, Item7A of this Form10-K.
Executive Overview Strategy Apaches mission is to grow a profitable global exploration and production company in a safe and environmentally responsible manner for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. Our growth strategy focuses on economic growth through exploration and development drilling, supplemented by occasional strategic acquisitions and portfolio high-grading through asset divestitures.
The Companys foundation for future growth is driven by our significant producing asset base and large undeveloped acreage positions. This allows for growth through sustainable lower-risk drilling opportunities, balanced by higher-risk, higher-reward exploration. We closely monitor drilling and acquisition cost trends in each of our core areas relative to product prices and, when appropriate, adjust our capital budgets accordingly and allocate funds to projects based on expected value. We do this through a disciplined and focused process that includes analyzing current economic conditions, projected rate of return on internally generated drilling inventories, and opportunities for tactical acquisitions or leasehold purchases that add substantial drilling prospects or, occasionally, provide access to new core areas that could enhance our portfolio.
Although operating cash flows are the Companys primary source of liquidity, we may also elect to utilize available committed borrowing capacity, access to both debt and equity capital markets, or proceeds from the sale of assets for all other liquidity needs. In May 2013, the Company announced plans to divest approximately $4 billion of assets by year-end 2013 to enhance financial flexibility and rebalance our portfolio to an asset mix we believe will continue to generate strong returns, drive more predictable growth, and deliver value to our shareholders. By year-end, Apache completed more than $7 billion in asset sales, as discussed in Operational Developments below. The Company used the proceeds to pay down nearly $2.6 billion of debt and to repurchase $1 billion of Apache common shares under a 30-million share repurchase program authorized by the Companys Board of Directors, and we exited the year with nearly $2 billion in cash.
We remain steadfast to the business principles that have guided Apaches progress since our inception. Throughout the cycles of our industry, our strategic focus on growing a diverse portfolio has underpinned our ability to deliver production and reserve growth and competitive returns on invested capital for the benefit of our shareholders. Delivering successful results under this strategy is bolstered by Apaches unique culture. A strong sense of urgency, empowerment of our employees, effective incentive systems, and an independent mindset are at the heart of how we build value.
Financial and Operating Results Continued volatility in the commodity price environment reinforces the importance of our asset portfolio. Our 2013 results reflected the benefit of our product balance, as combined crude oil and liquids represented 54 percent of our production but provided 83 percent of our $16.4 billion of oil and gas production revenues. In 34 Table of Contents addition, approximately 65 percent of our 2013 crude oil production is priced relative to Dated Brent crudes and sweet crude from the Gulf Coast, which continue to be priced at a significant premium to WTI-based prices. After the sale of our Gulf of Mexico Shelf assets, less of our U.S. crude oil production is receiving these premium prices, which reduces our overall price realizations.
Results for the year ended December31, 2013 include:  Apache reported annual daily production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids averaging 761 Mboe/d. Excluding the impact of the divested Gulf of Mexico Shelf and Canadian assets, production for the year would have increased 2 percent from 2012.
Liquids production for the year averaged a record 411 Mboe/d, an increase of 4 percent from 396 Mboe/d in 2012. Crude oil accounted for 84 percent of liquids production. North American onshore liquids production increased 34 percent, averaging 179 Mboe/d in 2013 compared to 133 Mboe/d in 2012.
Oil and gas production revenues totaled $16.4 billion, down $545 million from a record $16.9 billion in 2012, reflecting asset sales and lower realized prices compared to the prior year.
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $9.8 billion, an increase of 16 percent compared to 2012.
Apache reported $2.2 billion in income attributable to common stock, or $5.50 per diluted common share, up from $1.9 billion, or $4.92 per share, in 2012. Earnings for 2013 and 2012 reflect the after-tax impact of oil and gas property write-downs totaling $659 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. For additional discussion regarding these write-downs, please refer to Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesProperty and Equipment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item15 of this Form 10-K.
Apaches adjusted earnings, which exclude certain items impacting the comparability of results, were $3.2 billion, or $7.92 per diluted common share, down from $3.8 billion, or $9.48 per share, in 2012. Adjusted earnings is not a financial measure prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). For a description of adjusted earnings and a reconciliation of adjusted earnings to income attributable to common stock, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see Non-GAAP Measures in this Item7.
2014 Outlook As we head into 2014, we remain committed to the Companys mission. At the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013, Apache undertook a strategic review of our portfolio with the ultimate goal of focusing our company around the right mix of assets that can consistently generate strong returns, drive more predictable production growth, and create shareholder value. After completing more than $7 billion of divestitures in 2013 and announcing the agreed sale of our Argentine operations in 2014, our growth portfolio is centered on (i)increasing onshore North American liquids production that provides for predictable and attractive rates of return (ii)generating excess free cash flow from our international operations, and (iii)continuing longer-term growth initiatives which include our Wheatstone and Kitimat LNG projects.
We believe our core inventory of exploration and development projects offers numerous growth opportunities. Recent drilling successes and acquisitions of acreage positions across North America have built a robust drilling inventory for our Permian and Central regions that we intend to aggressively target because they are oil-prone and produce liquids-rich gas. Our plan for 2014 also includes further development of our major oil and gas discoveries and LNG projects in Australia and Canada, which, if completed, would enable us to monetize significant gas resources at prices more closely linked to crude oil.
Our initial 2014 capital budget is approximately $11.6 billion, or $11.1 billion excluding expenditures attributable to a one-third noncontrolling interest in Egypt. Approximately $7.1 billion is expected to be spent on 35 Table of Contents projects in North America, with the remaining amount allocated across our international regions. While funds have been committed for certain 2014 exploration wells, long-lead development projects, and front-end engineering and design (FEED) studies, the majority of our drilling and development projects are discretionary and subject to acceleration, deferral, or cancellation as conditions warrant. Approximately $2.4 billion of our 2014 capital will be invested in our Kitimat and Wheatstone LNG projects, reflecting our current project interests. Apache is actively evaluating ways to right-size its level of participation in the Kitimat LNG project.
We closely monitor commodity prices, service cost levels, regulatory impacts, and numerous other industry factors, and we typically review and revise our exploration and development budgets quarterly based on changes to actual and predicted operating cash flows.
Apaches current capital budget is estimated to deliver an increase in 2014 production between 5 percent and 8 percent from full-year 2013 production levels when excluding the divested assets.
Operational Developments Apache has a significant producing asset base as well as large undeveloped acreage positions that provide a platform for organic growth through sustainable lower-risk drilling opportunities, balanced by higher-risk, higher reward exploration. We are also continuing to advance several longer-term, individually significant development projects.
Exploration, Exploitation, and Development Activities Our internally generated exploration and drilling opportunities and multi-year development projects provide the foundation for our growth. Highlights of our 2013 drilling successes, exploration discoveries, LNG project milestones, and other opportunities for continued growth include: North American Activities Record Drilling Activity in U.S. Onshore Regions During 2013 Apache increased production in the Permian Basin 17 percent relative to 2012 through an active drilling program utilizing an average of 42 rigs. Over half of the regions production is crude oil and 18 percent is natural gas liquids (NGL). Combined, this represents almost a quarter of Apaches total liquids production for 2013.
The Central region increased production almost 50 percent relative to 2012 as a result of our active oil and liquids-rich drilling program across our nearly two million gross acres in the Anadarko basin. During the year we operated an average of 27 drilling rigs, and we drilled or participated in drilling 322 gross wells with 98 percent success.
In 2013, U.S. production represented 44 percent of Apaches total worldwide production, an increase from 40 percent in 2012. Focused drilling programs in the Permian Basin and Anadarko basin continue to provide momentum for Apaches U.S. production growth.
International Activities North Sea Development Apaches North Sea drilling success was highlighted with discoveries in the Tonto field. The Tonto-1 well, completed in April, had initial production of 10.3 Mb/d, and the Tonto-2 well, completed in September, had initial production of 8.3 Mb/d. Apache has a 100 percent working interest in the wells. The Tonto discovery follows Maule and Bacchus as the third new field brought online by Apache in the Forties area over the last three years. All three fields qualify for the U.K.s small field allowance, which provides economic incentives for operators to bring discoveries from small fields on production.
36 Table of Contents Egypt Discoveries In August, Apache announced seven oil and gas discoveries in four different geologic basins in Egypts Western Desert. In particular, the Riviera SW-1X discovery in the Abu Gharadig basin test-flowed 5,800 b/d and 2.8 Mcf/d from a Lower Bahariya sand with 24 feet of net pay. All seven discoveries have been tested and six are already producing.
Egypt Horizontal Drilling In 2013, the Company drilled its first well of a multi-well horizontal drilling program in the Abu Gharadig field. During December, this well produced an average of 1,681 b/d and 3 MMcf/d from a 1,970 foot lateral. The well was one of eight wells initiated during 2013 to test horizontal technology to increase recoveries in a variety of conventional and unconventional reservoirs. Additional horizontal drilling is planned in the Abu Gharadig and surrounding fields in 2014.
Australia Discoveries In July, Apache announced its Bianchi-1 natural gas discovery located 4 miles northeast of the 2011 Zola gas discovery offshore Western Australia in the Carnarvon Basin. The well logged 367 feet of net pay in eight reservoir zones between 15,577 and 17,530 feet subsea. Apache is in the early stages of evaluating the discovery and assessing potential commercial opportunities. Apache operates and owns a 30.25 percent working interest in the well.
Australia Macedon During the third quarter of 2013, Apache, along with operator and co-venturer BHP Billiton, officially commenced operations of the $1.5 billion Macedon natural gas facility, of which Apache owns a 28.57 percent interest. Macedon, Western Australias fourth domestic gas hub, has a production capacity of approximately 200 MMcf of natural gas per day.
Australia Wheatstone LNG Project On October1, 2013, Apache and its Australian partners finalized agreements to sell LNG to Tohoku Electric Power Company, Inc. from the Chevron-operated Wheatstone Project in Western Australia. The Wheatstone partners have agreed to supply 0.9million metric tons per annum of LNG for up to 20 years, which brings the total LNG supplies contracted to approximately 85 percent. Apache owns a 13 percent share in the Wheatstone project.
Acquisition and Divestiture Activity 2014 Activity Argentina Divestiture On February12, 2014, Apache subsidiaries announced an agreement to sell all of its operations in Argentina to Sociedad Annima (YPF) for cash consideration of $800 million plus the assumption of $52 million of bank debt as of June30, 2013. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014.
2013 Activity Egypt Sinopec Partnership On November14, 2013, Apache announced the completion of the sale of a one-third minority participation in its Egypt oil and gas business to Sinopec for cash consideration of $2.95 billion after customary closing adjustments. Apache will continue to operate the Egypt upstream oil and gas business. This noncontrolling interest is recorded separately in the Companys financial statements.
Gulf of Mexico Shelf Divestiture On September30, 2013, Apache completed the sale of its Gulf of Mexico Shelf operations and properties to Fieldwood, an affiliate of Riverstone Holdings. Under the terms of the agreement, Apache received cash consideration of $3.7 billion, and Fieldwood assumed $1.5 billion of discounted asset abandonment liabilities. Additionally, Apache retained 50 percent of its ownership interest in all exploration blocks and in horizons below production in developed blocks. Total region production in 2013 was 71 Mboe/d, reflecting nine months of Shelf production prior to the divestiture.
Canadian Divestitures In September, Apache completed the sale of primarily dry gas assets in Alberta for $214 million. The sale includes 621,000 gross acres (530,000 net acres) and more than 2,700 wells. Additionally in October of 2013, Apache completed two additional sales of Canadian oil and gas production properties for $112 million. The assets comprise approximately 4,000 operated and 1,300 non-operated wells. Combined, our 2013 divestitures totaled 13 percent of the regions production.
37 Table of Contents Kitimat LNG Project In February 2013, Apache completed a transaction with Chevron Canada Limited (Chevron Canada) under which each company became a 50 percent owner of the Kitimat LNG plant, the Pacific Trail Pipelines Limited Partnership (PTP), and 644,000 gross undeveloped acres in the Horn River and Liard basins. Chevron Canada will operate the LNG plant and pipeline while Apache Canada will continue to operate the upstream assets. Apaches net proceeds from the transaction were $396 million after post-closing adjustments.

NMNot meaningful Crude Oil Prices A substantial portion of our oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of the Companys control. Average realized crude oil prices for 2013 were essentially flat compared to 2012, although prices fluctuated throughout the year.
Continued volatility in the commodity price environment reinforces the importance of our diverse portfolio. While the market price received for natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil tends to trade within a tighter global range. With the exception of Argentina, price movements for all types and grades of crude oil 41 Table of Contents generally move in the same direction. Crude oil prices realized in 2013 averaged $101.99 per barrel; however, International Dated Brent crudes and sweet crude from the U.S. Gulf Coast continue to be priced at a premium to WTI-based prices. In 2013 we realized these premium prices on approximately 65 percent of our crude oil production. Our Egypt, Australia, and North Sea regions, which collectively comprised 50 percent of our 2013 worldwide oil production, received International Dated Brent pricing with 2013 oil realizations averaging $108.04 per barrel compared with 2012 oil realizations averaging $110.59 per barrel.
Natural Gas Prices Natural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions. The majority of our gas sales contracts are indexed to prevailing local market prices, highlighting the importance of a geographically balanced portfolio. Our primary markets include North America, Egypt, Australia, the U.K., and Argentina. An overview of the market conditions in our primary gas-producing regions follows.
North America has a common market; most of our gas is sold on a monthly or daily basis at either monthly or daily market prices. Our North American regions averaged $3.61 per Mcf in 2013, unchanged from 2012 levels.
In Egypt, our gas is sold to EGPC, primarily under an industry pricing formula indexed to Dated Brent crude oil with a maximum gas price of $2.65 per MMBtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. Under a legacy oil-indexed contract, which expired at the end of 2012, there was no price cap for our gas up to 100 MMcf/d of gross production. Overall, the region averaged $2.99 per Mcf in 2013, down 23 percent from the prior year.
Australia has historically had a local market with a limited number of buyers and sellers resulting in mostly long-term, fixed-price contracts that are periodically adjusted for changes in the local consumer price index. During 2013, the region averaged $4.43 per Mcf, a 3 percent decrease from 2012 levels.
Natural gas from the North Sea Beryl field is processed through the SAGE gas plant operated by Apache. The gas is sold to a third party at the St. Fergus entry point of the national grid on a National Balancing Point index price basis. The region averaged $10.43 per Mcf in 2013, a 17 percent increase from an average of $8.95 per Mcf in 2012.
During 2013, we realized an average price of $2.96 per Mcf in Argentina, an increase of 3 percent over the 2012 average price of $2.87per Mcf.
NGL Prices Apaches NGL production is sold under contracts with prices at market indices based on local supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.
Crude Oil Revenues 2013 vs. 2012 During 2013 crude oil revenues totaled $12.9billion, $307 million lower than the 2012 total of $13.2 billion, driven by a 2 percent decrease in worldwide production. Average daily production in 2013 was 346.6 Mb/d, with prices averaging $101.99 per barrel. Crude oil represented 79percent of our 2013 oil and gas production revenues and 46percent of our equivalent production, compared to 78 and 45percent, respectively, in the prior year. Lower production volumes reduced revenues $237 million, while slightly lower realized prices reduced revenues an additional $70million.
Worldwide oil production decreased 5.4 Mb/d, however, when excluding the Gulf of Mexico Shelf and Canadian assets that we sold during the year, oil production increased 3.6 Mb/d, driven by growth of 23.7 Mb/d from our North American regions. Our Permian and Central regions increased production by 11.9 Mb/d and 8.6 42 Table of Contents Mb/d, respectively, as a result of drilling and recompletion activity. Production from our remaining property base in Canada increased 1.9 Mb/d, or 12 percent, as a result of our continued focus on liquids-rich drilling targets. These increases were partially offset by a 20.1 Mb/d decrease in production from our international regions. Oil production from Egypt decreased 10.2 Mb/d, of which 7.8 Mb/d was related production used to pay taxes and, under the terms of our production sharing contracts, has no economic impact to Apache. Australias production decreased 9.6 Mb/d as a result of natural decline from our Pyrenees and Van Gogh fields.
2012 vs. 2011 During 2012 crude oil revenues totaled $13.2 billion, $531 million higher than the 2011 total of $12.7 billion, driven by a 4 percent increase in worldwide production. Average daily production in 2012 was 352.0 Mb/d, with prices averaging $102.53 per barrel. Crude oil represented 78 percent of our 2012 oil and gas production revenues and 45 percent of our equivalent production, compared to 75 and 45 percent, respectively, in the prior year. Higher realized prices contributed $43 million to the increase in full-year revenues, while higher production volumes added another $488 million.
Worldwide oil production increased 12.1 Mb/d, driven by a 14.7 Mb/d increase in the U.S. The Permian region increased 9.2 Mb/d on increased drilling and recompletion activity. The Central region increased 7.4 Mb/d on properties added from the Cordillera acquisition and drilling and recompletion activity. North Sea production increased 9.2 Mb/d primarily on volumes from the 2011 Mobil North Sea acquisition. Australia production decreased 9.3 Mb/d as a result of natural decline from our Pyrenees and Van Gogh fields.
Natural Gas Revenues 2013 vs. 2012 Natural gas revenues of $2.8billion for 2013 were $364 million lower than 2012, the result of a 9 percent decrease in production volumes and a 3 percent decrease in realized prices. Worldwide production decreased 196.4 MMcf/d, lowering revenues by $273million. Realized prices in 2013 averaged $3.70 per Mcf, a decrease of $0.10 per Mcf, which reduced revenues by an additional $91 million.
Worldwide gas production decreased 9 percent; however, excluding production from the Gulf of Mexico Shelf and Canadian assets sold during the year, gas production declined only 3 percent, or 60 MMcf/d. Production declined 66 MMcf/d from our remaining properties in Canada, a result of a shift in our drilling and recompletion activity from dry gas to liquids-rich gas properties. Argentina production decreased 26 MMcf/d on lower capital investments pending negotiations of extensions of several of our concessions, and production from our U.S. Deepwater region decreased 26 MMcf/d on natural decline. These decreases were partially offset by production increases of 52.6 MMcf/d in our U.S. onshore regions resulting from drilling activity focusing on liquids-rich targets, 9.4 MMcf/d in Australia on volumes from our Macedon field discovery, which commenced operations in the third quarter, and 2.7 MMcf/d in Egypt.
2012 vs. 2011 Natural gas revenues for 2012 of $3.2 billion were $416 million lower than 2011, the result of a 13 percent decrease in realized prices partially offset by a 1 percent increase in production volumes. Realized prices in 2012 averaged $3.80 per Mcf, a decrease of $0.57 per Mcf, which reduced revenues by $467 million. Worldwide production rose 31.1 MMcf/d, adding $51 million to revenues.
Worldwide gas production rose 1 percent on increases in the North Sea and Australia, partially offset by decreases in North America. North Sea daily production increased 55.2 MMcf/d, primarily as a result of the 2011 Mobil North Sea acquisition. Daily gas production in Australia increased 28.9 MMcf/d on new contracts associated with the recently completed gas processing facilities at Devil Creek. Central region rose 29.6 MMcf/d on production from the Cordillera acquisition. Daily production in Canada and the Gulf of Mexico onshore and offshore regions decreased 31.9 MMcf/d and 47.9 MMcf/d, respectively, as drilling and recompletion activity shifted from dry gas to liquids-rich gas properties.
43 Table of Contents NGL Revenues 2013 vs. 2012 NGL revenues totaled $670 million in 2013, an increase of $126 million from 2012, the result of a 46 percent increase in production volumes partially offset by a 15 percent decrease in realized prices. Worldwide production rose 20.2 Mb/d, adding $208million to revenues. This increase was primarily driven by drilling and recompletion activity in the U.S. Central and Permian regions. Realized prices in 2013 averaged $28.40 per Mcf barrel, a decrease of $5.05 per barrel, which reduced revenues by $82 million.
2012 vs. 2011 NGL revenues totaled $544 million in 2012, an increase of $22 million from 2011, the result of a 43 percent increase in production volumes partially offset by a 27 percent decrease in realized prices. Worldwide production rose 13.3 Mb/d, adding $164million to revenues. This increase was driven by drilling and recompletion activity in the U.S. Central and Permian regions and production from the Cordillera acquisition in the Central region. Realized prices in 2012 averaged $33.45 per Mcf barrel, a decrease of $12.50 per barrel, which reduced revenues by $142 million.
Operating Expenses The table below presents a comparison of our expenses on an absolute dollar basis and an equivalent unit of production (boe) basis. Our discussion may reference expenses on a boe basis, on an absolute dollar basis or both, depending on context. All 2013 operating expenses include costs attributable to a noncontrolling interest in Egypt.
For the Year Ended December31, 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 (Inmillions) (Perboe) Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Oil and gas property and equipment Recurring $ 5,114 $ 4,812 $ 3,814 $ 18.42 $ 16.88 $ 13.97 Additional 1,176 1,926 109 4.24 6.76 0.40 Other assets 410 371 281 1.47 1.30 1.03 Asset retirement obligation accretion 243 232 154 0.88 0.81 0.56 Lease operating costs 3,056 2,968 2,605 11.00 10.41 9.54 Gathering and transportation costs 297 303 296 1.06 1.08 1.08 Taxes other than income 832 862 899 3.00 3.02 3.29 General and administrative expense 503 531 459 1.81 1.86 1.68 Acquisitions, divestitures& transition 33 31 20 0.12 0.11 0.07 Financing costs, net 174 165 158 0.63 0.58 0.58 Total $ 11,838 $ 12,201 $ 8,795 $ 42.63 $ 42.81 $ 32.20 Recurring Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) The following table details the changes in recurring DD&A of oil and gas properties between December31, 2011, and December31, 2013: RecurringDD&A (In millions) 2011 DD&A $ 3,814 Volume change 231 DD&A Rate change 767 2012 DD&A $ 4,812 Volume change (83 ) DD&A Rate change 385 2013 DD&A $ 5,114 44 Table of Contents 2013 vs. 2012 Recurring full-cost depletion expense increased $302 million on an absolute dollar basis: $385 million on rate partially offset by a decrease of $83 million from lower volumes. Our full-cost depletion rate increased $1.54 to $18.42 per boe reflecting acquisition and drilling costs that exceed our historical levels.
2012 vs. 2011 Recurring full-cost depletion expense increased $998 million on an absolute dollar basis: $767 million on higher costs and $231 million from additional production. Our full-cost depletion rate increased $2.91 to $16.88 per boe as costs to acquire, find, and develop reserves, which were significantly impacted by higher oil prices, exceeded our historical cost basis. Price related reserve revisions in North America also had a negative impact on the rate.
Additional DD&A Under the full-cost method of accounting, the Company is required to review the carrying value of its proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country-by-country basis. Under these rules, capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, net of accumulated DD&A and deferred income taxes, may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, net of related tax effects and discounted 10 percent per annum and adjusted for cash flow hedges. Estimated future net cash flows are calculated using end-of-period costs and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements.
In 2013 we recorded non-cash write-downs of the carrying value of the Companys proved oil and gas properties totaling $1.1 billion. The after-tax impact of these write-downs was $356 million in the U.S., $139 million in the North Sea, and $118 million in Argentina. During the year, the Company also exited operations in Kenya and recorded $46 million net of tax to additional DD&A related to the impairment of the carrying value of the Kenyan oil and gas property leases.
In 2012 we recorded a non-cash write-down on the carrying value of our proved oil and gas property balances in Canada of $1.9 billion ($1.4 billion net of tax). The Company also recorded $28 million of additional DD&A related to the write-off of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties in New Zealand upon exiting the country and $15 million of seismic costs incurred in countries where Apache is pursuing exploration opportunities but has not yet established a presence.
Lease Operating Expenses Lease operating expenses (LOE) include several key components, such as direct operating costs, repair and maintenance, and workover costs.
Direct operating costs generally trend with commodity prices and are impacted by the type of commodity produced and the location of properties (i.e., offshore, onshore, remote locations, etc.). Fluctuations in commodity prices impact operating cost elements both directly and indirectly. They directly impact costs such as power, fuel, and chemicals, which are commodity price based. Commodity prices also affect industry activity and demand, thus indirectly impacting the cost of items such as rig rates, labor, boats, helicopters, materials, and supplies. Oil, which contributed nearly half of our 2013 production, is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Repair and maintenance costs are typically higher on offshore properties in Australia, the North Sea and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico regions.
45 Table of Contents The following table identifies changes in Apaches LOE rate from 2011 to 2013: For the Year Ended December31, 2013 For the Year Ended December31, 2012 Per boe Per boe 2012 LOE $ 10.41 2011 LOE $ 9.54 Divestitures (1) (0.12 ) Repairs and maintenance 0.39 Power and fuel costs 0.19 Labor and pumper costs 0.31 Labor and overhead costs 0.17 Non-operated property costs 0.12 Non-operated property costs 0.13 Workover costs 0.06 Transportation 0.12 Other 0.10 Workover costs 0.07 Other decreased production 0.01 Repairs and maintenance 0.07 Acquisitions (1) (0.12 ) Other 0.11 Other increased production (0.15 ) 2013 LOE $ 11.00 2012 LOE $ 10.41 (1) Per-unit impact of acquisitions and divestitures is shown net of associated production.
Gathering and Transportation We generally sell oil and natural gas under two common types of agreements, both of which include a transportation charge. One is a netback arrangement, under which we sell oil or natural gas at the wellhead and collect a lower relative price to reflect transportation costs to be incurred by the purchaser. In this case, we record sales at the netback price received from the purchaser. Alternatively, we sell oil or natural gas at a specific delivery point, pay our own transportation to a third-party carrier, and receive a price with no transportation deduction. In this case, we record the separate transportation cost as gathering and transportation costs.
In the U.S., Canada, and Argentina, we sell oil and natural gas under both types of arrangements. In the North Sea, we pay transportation charges to a third-party carrier. In Australia, oil and natural gas are sold under netback arrangements. In Egypt, our oil and natural gas production is primarily sold to EGPC under netback arrangements; however, we also export crude oil under both types of arrangements.
The following table presents gathering and transportation costs we paid directly to third-party carriers for each of the periods presented: FortheYearEndedDecember31, 2013 2012 2011 (Inmillions) Canada $ 155 $ 163 $ 166 U.S.
84 69 64 Egypt 42 39 34 North Sea 7 24 25 Argentina 9 8 7 Total Gathering and transportation $ 297 $ 303 $ 296 2013 vs. 2012 Gathering and transportation costs decreased $6 million from 2012. The U.S. costs for 2013 increased $15 million as compared to 2012 primarily as a result of increased production in the Permian and Central region from increased drilling activity. Egypt costs were up $3 million from increases in the world scale freight rates. North Sea costs decreased $17 million. Canadas costs decreased $8 million from a decline in activity.
46 Table of Contents 2012 vs. 2011 Gathering and transportation costs increased $7 million from 2011. The U.S. costs for 2012 increased $5 million as compared to 2011 on increased production in the Central region, primarily resulting from our acquisition of Cordillera. Egypts costs were up $5 million on a higher number of sales cargoes, increased terminal fees, and higher vessel freight costs. Canadas costs decreased $3 million from a decline in activity in the region.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes other than income primarily consist of U.K. Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT), severance taxes on properties onshore and in state or provincial waters off the coast of the U.S., Australia, and Argentina, and ad valorem taxes on properties in the U.S. and Canada. Severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues, while the U.K. PRT is assessed on net receipts from qualifying fields in the U.K. North Sea. We are subject to a variety of other taxes including U.S. franchise taxes, Australian Petroleum Resources Rent Tax, and various Canadian taxes, including the Freehold Mineral tax and Saskatchewan Resources surtax. The table below presents a comparison of these expenses: FortheYearEndedDecember31, 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) U.K. PRT $ 382 $ 451 $ 538 Severance taxes 254 220 212 Ad valorem taxes 113 104 94 Other 83 87 55 Total Taxes other than income $ 832 $ 862 $ 899 2013 vs. 2012 Taxes other than income were $30 million lower than 2012. U.K. PRT decreased $69 million over the comparable 2012 period based on a decrease in production revenues from qualifying fields during the year. Prior-year property acquisitions and higher drilling activity resulted in increases of $34 million and $9 million to severance and ad valorem tax expense, respectively.
2012 vs. 2011 Taxes other than income were $37 million lower than 2011. U.K. PRT decreased $87 million over the comparable 2011 period as a result of a decrease in net receipts, primarily driven by lower revenues on qualifying fields during the year. Property acquisitions in 2011 and 2012 resulted in increases of $8 million and $10 million to severance and ad valorem tax expense, respectively.
General and Administrative Expenses 2013 vs. 2012 General and administrative (G&A) expenses decreased $28 million, or 5 percent, from 2012. On a per-unit basis, G&A expenses were down $0.05 to $1.86 per boe, with the benefit of lower costs partially offset by the impact of lower production.
2012 vs. 2011 G&A expenses increased $72 million, or 16 percent, from 2011. On a per-unit basis, G&A expenses increased 11 percent, or $0.18 per boe: $0.12 per boe primarily relates to stock-based performance plan charges and $0.14 per boe relates to growth-related increases, less $0.08 on increased production.
Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Transition Costs In 2013, the Company recognized $33 million in acquisitions, divestitures, and transition costs related to the sale of our Gulf of Mexico Shelf assets to Fieldwood and our partnership with Sinopec in Egypt.
In 2012, the Company recognized $31 million in acquisitions, divestitures, and transition costs, reflecting expenses related to our 2011 acquisition of Mobil North Sea Limited and our 2012 acquisition of Cordillera.
47 Table of Contents In 2011, the Company recognized $20 million in acquisitions, divestitures, and transition costs, reflecting additional expenses related to our 2010 BP asset acquisitions and the Mariner merger as well as costs arising from our 2011 acquisition of Mobil North Sea Limited.
Financing Costs, Net Financing costs incurred during the period comprised the following: FortheYearEndedDecember31, 2013 2012 2011 (Inmillions) Interest expense $ 571 $ 509 $ 433 Amortization of deferred loan costs 8 7 5 Capitalized interest (374 ) (334 ) (263 ) Gain on extinguishment of debt (16 )   Interest income (15 ) (17 ) (17 ) Total Financing costs, net $ 174 $ 165 $ 158 2013 vs. 2012 Net financing costs increased $9 million from 2012. The increase is primarily related to a $62 million increase in interest expense from debt issuances during 2012, partially offset by a $40 million increase in capitalized interest resulting from additional unproved property balances in the Central and Permian regions. Additionally, Apache realized a gain of $16 million related to debt extinguished during 2013.
2012 vs. 2011 Net financing costs increased $7 million from 2011. The increase is primarily related to a $76 million increase in interest expense from debt issuances during 2012, partially offset by a $71 million increase in capitalized interest resulting from additional unproved property balances associated with the significant undeveloped acreage from the Cordillera acquisition and the U.S. New Ventures program.
Provision for Income Taxes The 2013 provision for income taxes totaled $1.9 billion, representing an effective tax rate of 45.7 percent. The 2013 effective rate reflects the tax benefit from the $1.2 billion non-cash write-downs in the U.S., North Sea, Argentina, and Kenya, impacts from foreign currency fluctuations and a $225 million charge related to distributed foreign earnings and other adjustments. Excluding these items, the 2013 effective tax rate would have been 42 percent.
The 2012 provision for income taxes totaled $2.9 billion, representing an effective tax rate of 59.0 percent. The 2012 effective rate reflects the tax impact from the $1.9 billion Canadian non-cash write-down, a $118 million charge for a North Sea decommissioning tax rate change and other tax adjustments primarily associated with valuation allowances in Canada and Argentina. Excluding these items, the 2012 effective tax rate would have been 44 percent, approximately comparable with the current year rate and the 2011 effective rate of 43 percent.
For additional information regarding income taxes, please refer to Note 7Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item15 of this Form 10-K.
Capital Resources and Liquidity Operating cash flows are the Companys primary source of liquidity. We may also elect to utilize available committed borrowing capacity, access to both debt and equity capital markets, or proceeds from the occasional sale of nonstrategic assets for all other liquidity and capital resource needs.
48 Table of Contents Apaches operating cash flows, both in the short-term and the long-term, are impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices. Significant deterioration in commodity prices negatively impacts our revenues, earnings and cash flows, and potentially our liquidity if spending does not trend downward as well. Sales volumes and costs also impact cash flows; however, these historically have not been as volatile and have less impact than commodity prices in the short-term.
Apaches long-term operating cash flows are dependent on reserve replacement and the level of costs required for ongoing operations. Cash investments are required to fund activity necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. Future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production is highly dependent on the success of our exploration and development activities and our ability to acquire additional reserves at reasonable costs.
We believe the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to Apache, combined with internally generated cash flows, will be adequate to fund short-term and long-term operations, including our capital spending program, repayment of debt maturities, and any amount that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.
In May 2013, Apache announced that it would divest approximately $4 billion in assets to enhance financial flexibility and rebalance our portfolio to an asset mix we believe will continue to generate strong returns, drive predictable growth, and deliver value to our shareholders. As of year-end 2013, Apache completed more than $7 billion in asset sales and used the proceeds to pay down nearly $2.6 billion in debt and to repurchase $1 billion in Apache common shares under a 30-million share repurchase program authorized by the Companys Board of Directors. The Company ended the year with nearly $2 billion of cash on hand.

49 Table of Contents Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents the sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents for the years presented: For the Year Ended December31, 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) Sources of Cash and Cash Equivalents: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 9,835 $ 8,504 $ 9,953 Commercial paper and bank loan borrowings, net  549  Sale of Gulf of Mexico Shelf properties 3,702   Proceeds from sale of Egypt noncontrolling interest 2,948   Proceeds from Kitimat LNG transaction, net 396   Proceeds from sale of oil and gas properties, other 307 27 422 Fixed-rate debt borrowings  4,978  Other 21  84 17,209 14,058 10,459 Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents: Capital expenditures (1) $ 11,220 $ 9,531 $ 7,078 Acquisitions 215 2,918 1,813 Equity investment in Yara Pilbara Holdings Pty Limited (YPHPL)  439  Commercial paper, credit facility and bank loan repayments, net 513  925 Dividends paid 360 332 306 Shares repurchased 997   Payments on fixed-rate debt 2,072 400  Other 86 573 176 15,463 14,193 10,298 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,746 $ (135 ) $ 161 (1) The table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis; therefore, the amounts differ from those discussed elsewhere in this document, which include accruals.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Operating cash flows are our primary source of capital and liquidity and are impacted, both in the short-term and the long-term, by volatile oil and natural gas prices. The factors that determine operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, with the exception of non-cash expenses such as DD&A, asset retirement obligation (ARO) accretion, and deferred income tax expense, which affect earnings but do not affect cash flows.
Net cash provided by operating activities for 2013 totaled $9.8 billion, up $1.3 billion from 2012. The increase reflects comparative changes in working capital during the periods.
For a detailed discussion of commodity prices, production, and expenses, please see Results of Operations in this Item7. For additional detail on the changes in operating assets and liabilities and the non-cash expenses which do not impact net cash provided by operating activities, please see the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item15 of this Form 10-K.
50 Table of Contents Proceeds from Sale of Oil and Gas Properties and Noncontrolling Interest in Egypt During 2013 Apache completed the sale of certain properties in Canada and the U.S. for $4.4 billion. Apache also completed the sale of a one-third minority participation in its Egypt oil and gas business to Sinopec for $2.95 billion. For information regarding our acquisitions and divestitures, please see Note 2Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item15 of this Form10-K.
Capital Investments We fund exploration and development (E&D) activities primarily through operating cash flows and budget capital expenditures based on projected operating cash flows. Our operating cash flows, both in the short and long term are impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices, production levels, industry trends impacting operating expenses and our ability to continue to acquire and find high-margin reserves at competitive prices. As a majority of our exploration and development activity is discretionary, we routinely adjust our capital budget on a quarterly basis in response to changing market conditions and operating cash flow forecasts.
We have used a combination of operating cash flows, borrowings under lines of credit and our commercial paper program, and occasionally, issues of public debt or common stock to fund other significant capital investments.
The following table details capital investments for each country in which we do business.
FortheYearEndedDecember31, 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) Exploration and Development: United States $ 5,473 $ 5,151 $ 2,768 Canada 720 590 817 North America 6,193 5,741 3,585 Egypt (1) 1,166 1,074 896 Australia 1,179 873 576 North Sea 874 886 823 Argentina 182 289 346 Other International 22 98 61 International (1) 3,423 3,220 2,702 Worldwide E&D Costs (1) 9,616 8,961 6,287 Gathering, Transmission, and Processing Facilities (GTP): United States 169 75 27 Canada 135 172 148 Egypt (1) 82 33 111 Australia 745 441 345 Argentina 11 16 12 North Sea 1 1  Total GTP Costs (1) 1,143 738 643 Asset Retirement Costs 484 948 819 Capitalized Interest 374 334 263 Capital Expenditures $ 11,617 $ 10,981 $ 8,012 Acquisitions, including GTP $ 377 $ 3,543 $ 3,189 Asset Retirement CostsAcquired 53 84 592 Total Acquisitions $ 430 $ 3,627 $ 3,781 (1) Includes 2013 capital costs attributable to a noncontrolling interest in Egypt.
51 Table of Contents Exploration and Development Worldwide E&D expenditures for 2013 totaled $9.6 billion, or 7 percent above 2012. E&D spending in North America was up 8 percent from the prior year and totaled 64 percent of worldwide E&D spending. Expenditures in the U.S. reflect increased drilling activity in the Anadarko basin and Permian Basin, where we continue to shift to more horizontal drilling. In the Permian Basin, we averaged operating 42 rigs during the year. Our recent drilling successes in the Permian has led the region to increase the number of horizontal drilling rigs being utilized throughout 2013, and now approximately half of our rigs are drilling horizontal wells that, given their nature, are more costly than vertical wells. In our Central region we have increased our activity in the Whittenburg and Anadarko basins where our active drilling programs continued to expand. E&D spending in Canada increased 22 percent from the prior-year period as the region has continued to target oil and liquids-rich gas plays across its acreage and drilling more horizontal wells.
E&D expenditures outside of North America increased 6 percent over 2012. Australian expenditures were up $306 million as both exploration and development drilling continued with high activity levels. Egypt was $92 million higher than the prior year on continued drilling activity across all major basins. E&D spending in the North Sea was up $12 million on Beryl field development activity, following the fields acquisition at the end of 2011. Argentina expenditures were down $107 million on decreased drilling activity.
Gathering, Transmission and Processing Facilities We invested $1.1 billion in GTP in 2013 compared to $738 million in 2012, primarily related to activities associated with the Wheatstone LNG project in Australia.
Acquisitions We acquired $377 million of oil and gas properties and GTP in 2013 compared to $3.5 billion in 2012. Acquisition capital expenditures occur as attractive opportunities arise and, therefore, vary from year to year. For information regarding our acquisitions and divestitures, please see Note 2Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item15 of this Form 10-K.
Payments on Fixed-Rate Debt During 2013, Apache repaid the $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.25 percent notes that matured on April15, 2013 and the $400 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.00 percent notes that matured on September15, 2013 by borrowing under our commercial paper program.
In November 2013 the Company announced a cash tender offer to purchase up to $850 million aggregate principal amount of five series of its outstanding notes. On December20, 2013, the Company accepted for purchase $669 million principal amount of its 2.625 percent notes due 2023 and $181 million principal amount of its 3.25 percent notes due 2022. Apache paid the holders an aggregate of approximately $811 million in cash reflecting principal, the discount to par, and accrued and unpaid interest.
In December 2013, Apache Finance Canada Corporation (Apache Finance Canada) fully redeemed $350 million principal amount of its 4.375 percent notes due in 2015. The notes were redeemed pursuant to the provisions of the notes indenture. Apache paid the holders an aggregate of approximately $371 million in cash reflecting principal, the premium to par, and accrued and unpaid interest.
Dividends The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 49 consecutive years through 2013. Future dividend payments will depend on the Companys level of earnings, financial requirements, and other relevant factors. Common stock dividends paid during 2013 totaled $303 million, compared with $256 million in 2012 and $230 million in 2011. The Company paid dividends on its Series D Preferred Stock totaling $57 million in 2013, compared with $76 million in each 2012 and 2011. The preferred stock was converted to common stock in August 2013.
In the first quarter of 2013 the Board of Directors approved an 18 percent increase to $0.20 per share for the regular quarterly cash dividend on the Companys common shares. This increase first applied to the dividend on common shares payable on May22, 2013, to stockholders of record on April22, 2013, and subsequent dividends paid.
52 Table of Contents In the first quarter of 2014 the Board of Directors approved a 25 percent increase to $0.25 per share for the regular quarterly cash dividend on the Companys common shares. This increase will apply to the dividend on common shares payable on May22, 2014, to stockholders of record on April22, 2014, and subsequent dividends paid.
Shares Repurchased In May 2013, Apaches Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 30million shares of the Companys common stock, valued at approximately $2 billion when first announced. Shares may be purchased either in the open market or through privately held negotiated transactions. The Company initiated the buyback program on June10, 2013, with the repurchase of 2,924,271 shares at an average price of $85.47 during the month of June. During the fourth quarter of 2013, 8,297,648 shares were repurchased at an average price of $90.08. An additional 2,393,917 shares were purchased subsequent to December31, 2013 at an average cost of $84.67. The Company anticipates that further purchases will primarily be made with proceeds from asset dispositions, but the Company is not obligated to acquire any specific number of shares.
Liquidity At December31, 2013 2012 (Inmillions,exceptpercentages) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,906 $ 160 Total debt 9,725 12,345 Equity 35,393 31,331 Available committed borrowing capacity 3,300 2,811 Floating-rate debt/total debt 1 % 5 % Percent of total debt-to-capitalization 22 % 28 % Cash and Cash Equivalents At December31, 2013, we had $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which $1.7 billion of cash was held by foreign subsidiaries, and approximately $158 million was held by Apache Corporation and U.S. subsidiaries. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries is subject to additional U.S. income taxes if repatriated. Almost all of the cash is denominated in U.S. dollars and, at times, is invested in highly liquid, investment-grade securities with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. We intend to use cash from our international subsidiaries to fund international projects.
Debt At December31, 2013, outstanding debt, which consisted of notes, debentures, and uncommitted bank lines, totaled $9.7 billion. Current debt consists of $53 million borrowed under uncommitted money market and overdraft lines of credit in Argentina and Canada. We have $900 million of debt maturing in 2017, $550 million maturing in 2018 and the remaining $8.3 billion maturing intermittently in years 2019 through 2096.
Available Credit Facilities As of December31, 2013, the Company had unsecured committed revolving syndicated bank credit facilities totaling $3.3 billion, of which $1.0billion matures in August2016 and $2.3 billion matures in June 2017. The facilities consist of a $1.7billion facility and a $1.0 billion facility in the U.S., a $300million facility in Australia, and a $300million facility in Canada. In July 2013, we amended our $1.0 billion U.S. credit facility to conform certain representations, covenants, and events of default to those in our $1.7 billion U.S. credit 53 Table of Contents facility. The amendments did not affect the amount or repayment terms of the $1.0 billion U.S. facility. As of December31, 2013, aggregate available borrowing capacity under the Companys credit facilities was $3.3 billion. The Companys committed credit facilities are used to support Apaches commercial paper program.
At the Companys option, the interest rate for the facilities is based on a base rate, as defined, or the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin determined by the Companys senior long-term debt rating. The $1.7 billion credit facility also allows the Company to borrow under competitive auctions.
At December31, 2013, the margin over LIBOR for committed loans was 0.875percent on the $1.0billion U.S. credit facility and 0.90percent on each of the $1.7 billion U.S. credit facility, the $300million Australian credit facility, and the $300 million Canadian credit facility. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees of 0.125percent on the total amount of the $1.0billion facility and 0.10percent on the total amount of the other three facilities. The facility fees vary based upon the Companys senior long-term debt rating.
The financial covenants of the credit facilities require the Company to maintain a debt-to-capitalization ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. At December31, 2013, the Companys debt-to-capitalization ratio was 22 percent.
The negative covenants include restrictions on the Companys ability to create liens and security interests on its assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens, and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics liens. The Company may incur liens on assets located in the U.S. and Canada of up to 5 percent of the Companys consolidated assets, or approximately $3.1 billion as of December31, 2013. There are no restrictions on incurring liens in countries other than the U.S. and Canada. There are also restrictions on Apaches ability to merge with another entity, unless the Company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on its ability to guarantee debt of entities not within its consolidated group.
There are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes. The credit facility agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments and terminate lending commitments if Apache Corporation, or any of its U.S. or Canadian subsidiaries, defaults on any direct payment obligation in excess of the stated thresholds noted in the agreements or has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it in excess of the stated thresholds noted in the agreements. The Company was in compliance with the terms of the credit facilities as of December31, 2013.
There is no assurance that the financial condition of banks with lending commitments to the Company will not deteriorate. We closely monitor the ratings of the 25 banks in our bank group. Having a large bank group allows the Company to mitigate the potential impact of any banks failure to honor its lending commitment.
Commercial Paper Program The Company has available a $3.0billion commercial paper program, which generally enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270days at competitive interest rates. The commercial paper program is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under committed credit facilities. Our 2013 weighted-average interest rate for commercial paper was 0.38 percent. If the Company is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, the Companys committed credit facilities, which expire in 2016 and 2017, are available as a 100 percent backstop. As of December31, 2013, the Company had no outstanding commercial paper. At December31, 2012, the Company had $489 million in commercial paper outstanding.
Letter of Credit Collateral In the event Apaches credit rating is downgraded by Moodys and S&P, Apache will need to provide a letter of credit as collateral to secure certain abandonment obligations. In conjunction with the Forties field and Mobil North Sea Limited acquisitions in 2003 and 2012, respectively, Apache assumed the abandonment 54 Table of Contents obligation of each seller for those properties. Although not currently required, to ensure Apaches payment of these costs, Apache agreed to deliver a letter of credit to the applicable seller if the rating of Apaches senior unsecured debt is lowered by both Moodys and Standard and Poors to ratings specified in the agreement with such seller.
Total Debt-to-Capitalization The Companys debt-to-capitalization ratio as of December31, 2013, was 22 percent as compared to 28 percent at December31, 2012. The decrease in our debt-to-capitalization ratio is directly related to the 2013 payment of fixed and floating debt and repurchase of shares. Apache has historically utilized available committed borrowing capacity, access to both debt and equity capital markets, and proceeds from the occasional sale of nonstrategic assets for liquidity and capital resources needs.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Apache enters into customary agreements in the oil and gas industry for drilling rig commitments, firm transportation agreements, and other obligations as described below in Contractual Obligations in this Item7.Other than the off-balance sheet arrangements described herein, Apache does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or capital resource positions.
We believe the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to Apache, combined with internally-generated cash flows, will be adequate to fund short-term and long-term operations, including our capital spending program, repayment of debt maturities, and any amount that may ultimately be paid in connection with commitments or contingencies.
Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations as of December31, 2013. For additional information regarding these obligations, please see Note 6Debt and Note 8Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item15 of this Form 10-K.
Contractual Obligations (1) Note Reference Total 2014 2015-2016 2017-2018 2019& Beyond (In millions) Debt, at face value Note6 $ 9,784 $ 53 $ 1 $ 1,450 $ 8,280 Interest payments Note6 10,234 482 965 907 7,880 Drilling rig commitments (2) Note8 974 376 429 157 12 Purchase obligations (3) Note8 1,759 1,002 533 204 20 Firm transportation agreements Note8 683 158 223 129 173 Office and related equipment Note8 391 46 101 95 149 Other operating lease obligations (4) Note8 686 190 295 193 8 Total Contractual Obligations $ 24,511 $ 2,307 $ 2,547 $ 3,135 $ 16,522 (1) This table does not include the Companys liability for dismantlement, abandonment, and restoration costs of oil and gas properties, derivative liabilities, pension or postretirement benefit obligations, or tax reserves. For additional information regarding these liabilities, please see Notes 5, 3, 9, and 7, respectively, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item15 of this Form 10-K.
(2) This represents minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. Apaches expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent Apache utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract.
(3) Purchase obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding, and specify all significant terms, including fixed and minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, 55 Table of Contents minimum or variable price provisions; and the appropriate timing of the transaction. These include minimum commitments associated with take-or-pay contracts, hydraulic fracturing service agreements, obtaining and processing seismic data, and contractual obligations to buy or build oil and gas plants and facilities, including LNG facilities.
(4) Other operating lease obligations pertain to other long-term exploration, development, and production activities. The Company has work-related commitments for oil and gas operations equipment, acreage maintenance commitments, FPSOs, and aircraft, among other things.
Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess settlements resulting from litigation. Apaches management feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations, including approximately $93 million for environmental remediation and approximately $10 million for various contingent legal liabilities. For a detailed discussion of the Companys environmental and legal contingencies, please see Note 8Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item15 of this Form 10-K.
The Company also had approximately $79 million accrued as of December31, 2013, for an insurance contingency as a member of Oil Insurance Limited (OIL). This insurance co-op insures specific property, pollution liability, and other catastrophic risks of the Company. As part of its membership, the Company is contractually committed to pay a withdrawal premium if we elect to withdraw from OIL. Apache does not anticipate withdrawal from the insurance pool; however, the potential withdrawal premium is calculated annually based on past losses and the nature of our asset base.
Insurance Program We maintain insurance policies that include coverage for physical damage to our assets, third party liability, workers compensation, employers liability, sudden pollution, and other risks. Our insurance coverage includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages.
Our current insurance policies covering physical damage to our assets provide $1 billion in coverage per occurrence. These policies also provide sudden pollution coverage. Coverage for damage to our U.S. Gulf of Mexico assets specifically resulting from a named windstorm, however, is subject to a maximum of $250 million per named windstorm, which includes a self-insured retention of 40 percent of the losses above a $100 million deductible and is limited to an annual aggregate of $300 million.
Our current insurance policies covering general liabilities provide coverage of $660 million subject to Apaches interest. This coverage is in excess of existing policies, including, but not limited to, aircraft liability, employers liability, and automobile liability. Our service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify Apache for injuries and death of the service providers employees as well as subcontractors hired by the service provider.
Our insurance policies generally renew in January and June of each year. Future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable.
Apache purchases multi-year political risk insurance from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and other highly rated international insurers covering its investments in Egypt. In the aggregate, these insurance policies, subject to the policy terms and conditions, provide approximately $856 million of coverage to Apache for losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks, with a $149 million sub-limit for currency inconvertibility.
56 Table of Contents In addition, the Company has a separate policy with OPIC, which provides $300 million of coverage for losses arising from (1)non-payment by EGPC of arbitral awards covering amounts owed Apache on past due invoices and (2)expropriation of exportable petroleum in the event that actions taken by the government of Egypt prevent Apache from exporting our share of production.In October 2012, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), a member of the World Bank Group, announced that it was providing $150 million in reinsurance to OPIC for the remainder of the policy term. This provision of long-term reinsurance to OPIC will allow Apache to maintain the $300 million of insurance coverage through 2024.
Non-GAAP Measures The Company makes reference to some measures in discussion of its financial and operating highlights that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. Management uses these measures in assessing operating results and believes the presentation of these measures provides information useful in assessing the Companys financial condition and results of operations. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measures and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used at other companies.
Adjusted Earnings To assess the Companys operating trends and performance, management uses Adjusted Earnings, which is net income excluding certain items that management believes affect the comparability of operating results. Management believes this presentation may be useful to investors who follow the practice of some industry analysts who adjust reported company earnings for items that may obscure underlying fundamentals and trends. The reconciling items below are the types of items management excludes and believes are frequently excluded by analysts when evaluating the operating trends and comparability of the Companys results.

Separately, a $75 million non-cash write-down was recorded related to the Companys exit of operations in Kenya, for which a tax benefit of $29 million was recognized. A non-cash write-down on the carrying value of our proved oil and gas property balances in Canada of $1.9 billion was recorded during 2012, for which a tax benefit of $474 million was recognized. The tax effect was calculated utilizing the Canadian statutory rate currently in effect.

(3) Acquisitions, divestitures, and transition costs recorded in 2013, 2012, and 2011, totaled $33 million, $31 million, and $20 million, respectively, for which tax benefits of $12 million, $12 million, and $7 million, respectively, were recognized. The tax effect was calculated utilizing the statutory rates in effect in each country where costs were incurred.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Apache prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Apache identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of Apaches financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity, and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection, and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. The following is a discussion of Apaches most critical accounting policies.
Reserves Estimates Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations.
Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time.
Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For example, since we use the units-of-production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our DD&A expense. Our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves. Finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures.
Reserves are calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements.
Apache has elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing.
58 Table of Contents Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Apaches removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety, and public relations considerations.
ARO associated with retiring tangible long-lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. The liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset. The ARO liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with Apaches oil and gas properties. The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental, and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value.
Income Taxes Our oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to taxation on income in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices).
The Company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes accruals for tax contingencies that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the Company operates. Tax reserves have been established and include any related interest, despite the belief by the Company that certain tax positions meet certain legislative, judicial, and regulatory requirements. These reserves are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law, and any new legislation. The Company believes that the reserves established are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments.
Purchase Price Allocation Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
The purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value. Estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired companys assets and liabilities and tax-related carryforwards at the merger date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known. The amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost.
In estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we made various assumptions. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved crude oil and 59 Table of Contents natural gas properties. To estimate the fair values of these properties, we prepared estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves as described above in Reserve Estimates of this Item7. Estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future.
ITEM7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our exposure to market risk. The term market risk relates to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, gas, and NGL prices, interest rates, or foreign currency and adverse governmental actions. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. The forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures.
Commodity Risk The Companys revenues, earnings, cash flow, capital investments and, ultimately, future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, which have historically been very volatile because of unpredictable events such as economic growth or retraction, weather and political climate. In 2013, our average crude oil realizations have remained flat at $101.99 per barrel compared to $102.53 per barrel in 2012. Our average natural gas price realizations decreased 3 percent in 2013 to $3.70 per Mcf from $3.80 per Mcf in 2012.
We periodically enter into derivative positions on a portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity prices. Apache typically uses futures contracts, swaps, and options to mitigate commodity price risk. In 2013 approximately 8 percent of our natural gas production and approximately 42 percent of our crude oil production was subject to financial derivative hedges, compared with 13 percent and 13 percent, respectively, in 2012.
On December31, 2013, the Company had open natural gas derivatives in an asset position with a fair value of $3 million. A 10 percent movement in natural gas prices would move the fair value by approximately $463,000. The Company also had open oil derivatives in a liability position with a fair value of $301 million. A 10 percent increase in oil prices would increase the liability by approximately $476 million, while a 10 percent decrease in prices would move the derivatives to an asset position of $175 million. These fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters at December31, 2013. See Note 3Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item15 of this Form 10-K.
Interest Rate Risk The Company considers its interest rate risk exposure to be minimal as a result of fixing interest rates on approximately 99.5 percent of the Companys debt. At December31, 2013, total debt included $53 million of floating-rate debt. As a result, Apaches annual interest costs in 2013 will fluctuate based on short-term interest rates on approximately 0.5 percent of our total debt outstanding at December31, 2013. A 10 percent change in floating interest rates on year-end floating debt balances would change annual interest expense by approximately $1.6 million.
Foreign Currency Risk The Companys cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. In Australia, oil production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and gas production is sold under a mixture of fixed-price U.S. dollar and Australian dollar contracts. Approximately 40 percent of the costs incurred for Australian operations are paid in U.S. dollars. In Canada, oil 60 Table of Contents and gas prices and costs, such as equipment rentals and services, are generally denominated in Canadian dollars but are heavily influenced by U.S. markets. Our North Sea production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of costs incurred are paid in British pounds. In Egypt, all oil and gas production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of the costs incurred are denominated in U.S. dollars. Argentine revenues and expenditures are largely denominated in U.S. dollars, but are converted into Argentine pesos at the time of payment. Revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds, and Argentine pesos are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the average exchange rates during the period.
Foreign currency gains and losses also arise when monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the end of each month. Currency gains and losses are included as either a component of Other under Revenues and Other or, as is the case when we re-measure our foreign tax liabilities, as a component of the Companys provision for income tax expense on the statement of consolidated operations. A 10 percent strengthening or weakening of the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Argentine peso against the U.S. dollar as of December31, 2013, would result in a foreign currency net loss or gain, respectively, of approximately $186 million.

The financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include amounts that are based on managements best estimates and judgments.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a written code of business conduct adopted by our Companys board of directors, applicable to all Company directors and all officers and employees of our Company and subsidiaries.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (1992).
Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013.
The Companys independent auditors, Ernst& Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit Committee of the Companys board of directors. Ernst& Young LLP have audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries, and the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. The reports of the independent auditors follow this report on pages F-2 and F-3.
/s/ G. Steven Farris Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and President (principal executive officer) /s/ Thomas P. Chambers Senior Vice President, Finance (principal financial officer) /s/ Rebecca A. Hoyt Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller (principal accounting officer) Houston, Texas February28, 2014 F-1 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apache Corporation: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries at December31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2013, in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Apache Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) and our report dated February28, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
/s/ ERNST& YOUNG LLP Houston, Texas February28, 2014 F-2 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apache Corporation: We have audited Apache Corporation and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (the COSO criteria). Apache Corporation and subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Apache Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2013 of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries, and our report dated February28, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

F-8 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Nature of Operations Apache Corporation (Apache or the Company) is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. The Company has exploration and production interests in six countries: the United States (U.S.), Canada, Egypt, Australia, the United Kingdom (U.K.) North Sea (North Sea), and Argentina. Apache also pursues exploration interests in other countries that may over time result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities.
1.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting policies used by Apache and its subsidiaries reflect industry practices and conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The Companys financial statements for prior periods may include reclassifications that were made to conform to the current-year presentation. Significant policies are discussed below.
Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apache and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. The Companys undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures and partnerships are proportionately consolidated. The Company consolidates all other investments in which, either through direct or indirect ownership, Apache has more than a 50 percent voting interest or controls the financial and operating decisions. Noncontrolling interests represent third-party ownership in the net assets of a consolidated Apache subsidiary and are reflected separately in the Companys financial statements. For further information, please refer to Note 2  Acquisitions and Divestitures. Investments in which Apache holds less than 50 percent of the voting interest are typically accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with the balance recorded as a component of Deferred charges and other in Apaches consolidated balance sheet and results of operations recorded as a component of Other under Revenues and Other in the Companys statement of consolidated operations.
Use of Estimates Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Apache evaluates its estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of its financial statements and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. Significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include the fair value determination of acquired assets and liabilities (see Note 2  Acquisitions and Divestitures), the estimate of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom (see Note 14  Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures), the assessment of asset retirement obligations (see Note 5  Asset Retirement Obligation), and the estimate of income taxes (see Note 7  Income Taxes).
Fair Value Measurements Certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on a recurring basis in Apaches consolidated balance sheet. Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820-10-35 provides a hierarchy that prioritizes and defines the types of inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs, F-9 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) which consist of unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 2 inputs consist of quoted prices for similar instruments. Level 3 valuations are derived from inputs that are significant and unobservable; hence, these valuations have the lowest priority.
The valuation techniques that may be used to measure fair value include a market approach, an income approach, and a cost approach. A market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. An income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on current market expectations, including present value techniques, option-pricing models, and the excess earnings method. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost).
Fair value measurements are presented in further detail in Note 3  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, Note 6  Debt, and Note 9  Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans.
Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, Apache had $1.9 billion and $160 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are stated at the historical carrying amount net of write-offs and an allowance for uncollectible accounts.The carrying amount of Apaches accounts receivable approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of the instruments.The Company routinely assesses the collectability of all material trade and other receivables. Many of Apaches receivables are from joint interest owners on properties Apache operates. The Company may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of these joint interest billings. The Company accrues a reserve on a receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of any reserve may be reasonably estimated. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $96 million and $82 million, respectively.
Inventories Inventories consist principally of tubular goods and equipment, stated at weighted-average cost, and oil produced but not sold, stated at the lower of cost or market.
Property and Equipment The carrying value of Apaches property and equipment represents the cost incurred to acquire the property and equipment, including capitalized interest. Interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized in concurrence with the related assets. For business combinations, property and equipment cost is based on the fair values at the acquisition date.
Oil and Gas Property The Company follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil and gas property. Under this method of accounting, all costs incurred for both successful and unsuccessful exploration and development activities, including salaries, benefits, and other internal costs directly identified with these activities, and oil and gas F-10 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) property acquisitions are capitalized. All costs related to production, general corporate overhead, and similar activities are expensed as incurred. Apache capitalized $401 million, $402 million, and $335 million of internal costs in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
Proved properties are amortized on a country-by-country basis using the units of production method (UOP). The UOP calculation multiplies the percentage of estimated proved reserves produced each quarter by the cost of those reserves. The amortization base in the UOP calculation includes the sum of proved property, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A), estimated future development costs (future costs to access and develop proved reserves), and asset retirement costs, less related salvage value.
The cost of unproved properties and properties under development are excluded from the amortization calculation until it is determined whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to such properties or until development projects are placed in service. Geological and geophysical costs not associated with specific prospects are recorded to proved property immediately. Unproved properties and properties under development are reviewed for impairment at least quarterly. In countries where proved reserves exist, exploratory drilling costs associated with dry holes are transferred to proved properties immediately upon determination that a well is dry and amortized accordingly. In countries where a reserve base has not yet been established, impairments are charged to earnings and are determined through an evaluation considering, among other factors, seismic data, requirements to relinquish acreage, drilling results, remaining time in the commitment period, remaining capital plan, and political, economic, and market conditions. In 2013, Apaches statement of consolidated operations includes additional DD&A of $75 million related to exiting operations in Kenya. In 2012, Apache recorded additional DD&A of $28 million related to exiting operations in New Zealand and $15 million of seismic costs incurred in countries where it has no established presence. In 2011, Apache recorded additional DD&A of $60 million related to exiting operations in Chile and $49 million of seismic costs incurred in countries where it has no established presence.
Under the full-cost method of accounting, the net book value of oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, may not exceed a calculated ceiling. The ceiling limitation is the estimated after-tax future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted at 10 percent per annum and adjusted for designated cash flow hedges. Future cash outflows associated with settling accrued asset retirement obligations are excluded from the calculation. Estimated future net cash flows are calculated using end-of-period costs and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. See Note 14  Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures for a discussion of the calculation of estimated future net cash flows.
Any excess of the net book value of proved oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, over the ceiling is charged to expense and reflected as additional DD&A in the accompanying statement of consolidated operations. Such limitations are imposed separately on a country-by-country basis and are tested quarterly. During 2013, Apache recorded non-cash write-downs of the carrying value of the Companys proved oil and gas properties totaling $1.1 billion. The after-tax impact of these write-downs was $356 million in the U.S., $139 million in the North Sea, and $118 million in Argentina. Cash flow hedges did not materially affect the 2013 calculations. During 2012, the Company recorded a $1.9 billion ($1.4 billion net of tax) non-cash write-down of the carrying value of the Companys Canadian proved oil and gas properties. Excluding the effects of cash flow hedges in calculating the ceiling limitation, the write-down for the full year would have been higher by $135 million ($101 million net of tax).
Proceeds from the sale or disposition of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a reduction to capitalized costs unless a significant portion (greater than 25 percent) of the Companys reserve quantities in a particular country are sold, in which case a gain or loss is recognized in income. No gain or loss was recorded on the Companys divestitures in 2013, 2012, or 2011.
F-11 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Gathering, Transmission, and Processing Facilities Gathering, transmission, and processing facilities totaled $7.0 billion and $6.0 billion at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company assesses the carrying amount of its gathering, transmission, and processing facilities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of these facilities is less than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over its fair value. No impairment of gathering, transmission, and processing facilities was recognized during 2013, 2012, or 2011.
Gathering, transmission, and processing facilities, buildings, and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to 25 years. Accumulated depreciation for these assets totaled $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Asset Retirement Costs and Obligations The initial estimated asset retirement obligation related to property and equipment is recorded as a liability at its fair value, with an offsetting asset retirement cost recorded as an increase to the associated property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. If the fair value of the recorded asset retirement obligation changes, a revision is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement cost. Revisions in estimated liabilities can result from changes in estimated inflation rates, changes in service and equipment costs and changes in the estimated timing of an assets retirement. Asset retirement costs are depreciated using a systematic and rational method similar to that used for the associated property and equipment. Accretion expense on the liability is recognized over the estimated productive life of the related assets.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an entity over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company assesses the carrying amount of goodwill by testing for impairment annually and when impairment indicators arise. Goodwill totaled $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, goodwill of $163 million and $84 million, respectively, was recorded in the North Sea. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, goodwill of $1.0 billion, $103 million, and $86 million was recorded in the U.S., Canada, and Egypt, respectively. Each country was assessed as a reporting unit, and no impairment of goodwill was recognized during 2013, 2012, or 2011.
Accounts Payable Included in accounts payable at December31, 2013 and 2012, are liabilities of approximately $271 million and $255 million, respectively, representing the amount by which checks issued but not presented to the Companys banks for collection exceeded balances in applicable bank accounts.
Commitments and Contingencies Accruals for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, environmental and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted as additional information becomes available or circumstances change.
Revenue Recognition and Imbalances Oil and gas revenues are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, when delivery has occurred and title has transferred, and if collectability of the revenue is probable. Cash received relating to future revenues is deferred and recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met.
F-12 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Apache uses the sales method of accounting for gas production imbalances. The volumes of gas sold may differ from the volumes to which Apache is entitled based on its interests in the properties. These differences create imbalances that are recognized as a liability only when the properties estimated remaining reserves net to Apache will not be sufficient to enable the under-produced owner to recoup its entitled share through production. The Companys recorded liability is generally reflected in other non-current liabilities. No receivables are recorded for those wells where Apache has taken less than its share of production. Gas imbalances are reflected as adjustments to estimates of proved gas reserves and future cash flows in the unaudited supplemental oil and gas disclosures.
Apache markets its own U.S. natural gas production. Since the Companys production fluctuates because of operational issues, it is occasionally necessary to purchase third-party gas to fulfill sales obligations and commitments. Both the costs and sales proceeds of this third-party gas are reported on a net basis in oil and gas production revenues. The costs of third-party gas netted against the related sales proceeds totaled $34 million, $27 million, and $28 million, for 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
The Companys Egyptian operations are conducted pursuant to production sharing contracts under which contractor partners pay all operating and capital costs for exploring and developing the concessions. A percentage of the production, generally up to 40 percent, is available to contractor partners to recover these operating and capital costs over contractually defined periods. Cost recovery is reflected in revenue. The balance of the production is split among the contractor partners and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on a contractually defined basis.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Apache periodically enters into derivative contracts to manage its exposure to commodity price risk. These derivative contracts, which are generally placed with major financial institutions, may take the form of forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps, or options. The oil and gas reference prices upon which the commodity derivative contracts are based reflect various market indices that have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices received by the Company for its oil and gas production.
Apache records all derivative instruments, other than those that meet the normal purchases and sales exception, on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in current-period income as Derivative instrument gains (losses), net under Revenues and Other in the statement of consolidated operations. Hedge accounting treatment allows unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges to be deferred in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses from the Companys oil and gas cash flow hedges, including terminated contracts, are generally recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the forecasted transaction occurs. If at any time the likelihood of occurrence of a hedged forecasted transaction ceases to be probable, hedge accounting treatment will cease on a prospective basis, and all future changes in the fair value of the derivative will be recognized directly in earnings. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income prior to the change in the likelihood of occurrence of the forecasted transaction will remain in other comprehensive income until such time as the forecasted transaction impacts earnings. If it becomes probable that the original forecasted production will not occur, then the derivative gain or loss would be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings immediately. Hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time, and any ineffectiveness is immediately reported as Other under Revenues and Other in the statement of consolidated operations.
F-13 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses are reported net of recoveries from owners in properties operated by Apache and net of amounts related to lease operating activities or capitalized pursuant to the full-cost method of accounting.
Income Taxes Apache records deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements and tax returns. The Company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices) and changing tax laws.
Apache does not recognize U.S. deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries that are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. When such earnings are no longer deemed permanently reinvested, Apache recognizes the appropriate deferred or current income tax liabilities.
Foreign Currency Transaction Gains and Losses The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for each of Apaches international operations. The functional currency is determined country-by-country based on relevant facts and circumstances of the cash flows, commodity pricing environment and financing arrangements in each country. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses arise when monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured to their U.S. dollar equivalent at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting period. Foreign currency gains and losses also arise when revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in a countrys local currency are converted to a U.S. dollar equivalent based on the average exchange rates during the reporting period.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to current taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded as components of the provision for income taxes. In 2013, Apache recorded a tax benefit of $154 million, including current and deferred taxes. In 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded tax expense of $16 million and a tax benefit of $66 million, respectively. For further discussion, please refer to Note 7  Income Taxes. All other foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reflected in Other under Revenues and Other in the statement of consolidated operations. The Companys other foreign currency gains and losses netted to a loss in 2013 of $30 million and gains in 2012 and 2011 of $24 million and $4 million, respectively.
Insurance Coverage The Company recognizes an insurance receivable when collection of the receivable is deemed probable. Any recognition of an insurance receivable is recorded by crediting and offsetting the original charge. Any differential arising between insurance recoveries and insurance receivables is recorded as a capitalized cost or as an expense, consistent with its original treatment.
Earnings Per Share The Companys basic earnings per share (EPS) amounts have been computed based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution, using the treasury stock method, which assumes that options were exercised and restricted stock was F-14 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) fully vested. The diluted EPS calculations for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2013, includes weighted-average shares of common stock from the assumed conversion of Apaches convertible preferred stock. For the year ended December31, 2012, the diluted EPS calculation excludes shares related to the assumed conversion of the convertible preferred stock as such conversion would have been anti-dilutive.
Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation  Stock Compensation. The Company grants various types of stock-based awards including stock options, nonvested restricted stock units, and performance-based awards. Additionally, the Company also grants cash-based stock appreciation rights. These plans and related accounting policies are defined and described more fully in Note 10  Capital Stock. Stock compensation awards granted are valued on the date of grant and are expensed, net of estimated forfeitures, over the required service period.
ASC Topic 718 also requires that benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as financing cash flows rather than as operating cash flows. The Company classified $1 million, $4 million, and $32 million as financing cash inflows in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
Treasury Stock The Company follows the weighted-average-cost method of accounting for treasury stock transactions.
New Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No.2013-11, which requires entities to present unrecognized tax benefits as a decrease in a net operating loss, similar tax loss, or tax credit carryforward if certain criteria are met. The guidance will eliminate the diversity in practice in the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits but will not alter the way in which entities assess deferred tax assets for realizability. ASU No.2013-11 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December15, 2013. The Company will apply all changes prospectively and does not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.2013-04, which increases disclosures for certain liability arrangements. The guidance requires an entity that is joint and severally liable to measure the obligation as the sum of the amount the entity has agreed with co-obligors to pay and any additional amount it expects to pay on behalf of one or more co-obligors. Required disclosures include a description of the nature of the arrangement, how the liability arose, the relationship with co-obligors and the terms and conditions of the arrangement. ASU No.2013-04 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December15, 2013. The Company does not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
2. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 2014 Activity Argentina Divestiture On February12, 2014, Apache Corporation and its subsidiaries announced an agreement to sell all of its operations in Argentina to YPF Sociedad Annima for cash consideration of $800 million plus the assumption of $52 million of bank debt as of June30, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, Apaches net assets in Argentina totaled approximately $1.3 billion, and the Company expects to recognize a loss associated with this transaction upon closing. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014.
F-15 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 2013 Activity Egypt Partnership On November14, 2013, Apache completed the sale of aone-thirdminority participation in itsEgyptoil and gas business toa subsidiary of Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec). Apache received cash consideration of $2.95 billion after customary closing adjustments. Apache continues to operate its Egypt upstream oil and gas business. The effective date of the agreement is January1, 2013.
Apache recorded $1.9 billion of the proceeds as a non-controlling interest, which is reflected as a separate component of equity in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. This represents one-third of Apaches net book value of its Egypt holdings at the time of the transaction. The remaining proceeds were recorded as additional paid-in capital. Included in Net income including noncontrolling interest for the year ended December31, 2013, is net income attributable to Sinopecs interest totaling $56 million.
Gulf of Mexico Shelf Divestiture On September30, 2013, Apache completed the sale of its Gulf of Mexico Shelf operations and properties to Fieldwood Energy LLC (Fieldwood), an affiliate of Riverstone Holdings. Under the terms of the agreement, Apache received cash consideration of $3.7 billion, and Fieldwood assumed $1.5 billion of discounted asset abandonment liabilities. Additionally, Apache retained 50 percent of its ownership interest in all exploration blocks and in horizons below production in developed blocks. The effective date of the agreement is July1, 2013. Apaches net book value of oil and gas properties was reduced by approximately $4.6 billion of proved property costs and $473 million of unproved property costs as a result of the transaction.
Canada LNG Project In February 2013, Apache completed a transaction with Chevron Canada Limited (Chevron Canada) under which each company became a 50 percent owner of the Kitimat LNG plant, the Pacific Trail Pipelines Limited Partnership (PTP), and 644,000 gross undeveloped acres in the Horn River and Liard basins. Chevron Canada will operate the LNG plant and pipeline while Apache Canada will continue to operate the upstream assets. Apaches net proceeds from the transaction were $396 million after post-closing adjustments, and no gain or loss was recorded.
Other Activity During 2013 Apache completed $307 million of other oil and gas property sales and $215 million of oil and gas property acquisitions.
2012 Activity Cordillera Energy Partners III, LLC Acquisition On April30, 2012, Apache completed the acquisition of Cordillera Energy Partners III, LLC (Cordillera), a privately-held exploration and production company, in a stock and cash transaction. Cordilleras properties included approximately 312,000 net acres in the Granite Wash, Tonkawa, Cleveland, and Marmaton plays in western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle.
Apache issued 6,272,667 shares of common stock and paid approximately $2.7 billion of cash to the sellers as consideration for the transaction. The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of F-16 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) accounting, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The following table summarizes the final estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition.

Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.
Yara Pilbara Holdings Pty Limited Acquisition On January31, 2012, a subsidiary of Apache Energy Limited completed the acquisition of a 49 percent interest in Yara Pilbara Holdings Pty Limited (YPHPL, formerly Burrup Holdings Limited) for $439 million, including working capital adjustments. The transaction was funded with debt. Yara Australia Pty Ltd (Yara) owns the remaining 51 percent of YPHPL and operates the plant. The investment in YPHPL is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with the balance recorded as a component of Deferred charges and other in Apaches consolidated balance sheet and results of operations recorded as a component of Other under Revenues and other in the Companys statement of consolidated operations.
2011 Activity Mobil North Sea Limited Acquisition On December30, 2011, Apache completed the acquisition of Mobil North Sea Limited (Mobil North Sea). The assets acquired include: operated interests in the Beryl, Nevis, Nevis South, Skene, and Buckland fields; operated interest in the Beryl/Brae gas pipeline and the SAGE gas plant; non-operated interests in the Maclure, Scott, and Telford fields; and Benbecula (west of Shetlands) exploration acreage. This acquisition was funded with existing cash on hand.

Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Transition Expenses In 2013, Apache recorded $33 million of investment banking fees and other costs associated with divestitures during the year. In 2012, the Company recorded $31 million of expenses reflecting costs related to our 2011 acquisition of Mobil North Sea and our 2012 acquisition of Cordillera. In 2011, Apache recorded $20 million of expenses primarily for separation and other costs related to the merger with Mariner Energy, Inc. (Mariner) and the acquisition of Mobil North Sea.
3. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Objectives and Strategies The Company is exposed to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on the majority of its worldwide production. Apache manages the variability in its cash flows by occasionally entering into derivative transactions on a portion of its crude oil and natural gas production. The Company utilizes various types of derivative financial instruments, including swaps and options, to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity prices.
Counterparty Risk The use of derivative instruments exposes the Company to counterparty credit risk, or the risk that a counterparty will be unable to meet its commitments. To reduce the concentration of exposure to any individual counterparty, Apache utilizes a diversified group of investment-grade rated counterparties, primarily financial institutions, for its derivative transactions. As of December31, 2013, Apache had derivative positions with 14 counterparties. The Company monitors counterparty creditworthiness on an ongoing basis; however, it cannot predict sudden changes in counterparties creditworthiness. In addition, even if such changes are not sudden, the Company may be limited in its ability to mitigate an increase in counterparty credit risk. Should one of these counterparties not perform, Apache may not realize the benefit of some of its derivative instruments resulting from lower commodity prices.
F-18 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The Company executes commodity derivative transactions under master agreements that have netting provisions that provide for offsetting payables against receivables. In general, if a party to a derivative transaction incurs a material deterioration in its credit ratings, as defined in the applicable agreement, the other party has the right to demand the posting of collateral, demand a transfer, or terminate the arrangement. The Companys net derivative liability position at December31, 2013, represents the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position. The Company has not provided any collateral to any of its counterparties as of December31, 2013.
Derivative Instruments As of December31, 2013, Apache had the following open crude oil derivative positions which have not been designated as cash flow hedges: Fixed-Price Swaps Production Period Settlement Index Mbbls Weighted Average FixedPrice 2014 NYMEX WTI 22,889 $ 90.77 2014 Dated Brent 22,812 100.05 As of December31, 2013, Apache had the following open natural gas derivative positions which have been designated as cash flow hedges: Fixed-Price Swaps Production Period Settlement Index MMBtu (in000s) Weighted Average FixedPrice 2014 NYMEX Henry Hub 1,295 $ 6.72 Subsequent to December31, 2013, Apache entered into additional natural gas derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges totaling 55.9million MMBtu for 2014. These contracts are settled against NYMEX Henry Hub and various Inside FERC indices, with a weighted average fixed price of $4.35.
Fair Value Measurements Apaches commodity derivative instruments consist of variable-to-fixed price commodity swaps and options. The fair values of the Companys derivative instruments are not actively quoted in the open market. The Company uses a market approach to estimate the fair values of its derivative instruments, utilizing commodity futures price strips for the underlying commodities provided by a reputable third party. These valuations are Level 2 inputs.
F-19 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The following table presents the Companys derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: Fair Value Measurements Using QuotedPrice in Active Markets (Level1) Significant Other Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level3) Total Fair Value Netting(1) Carrying Amount (In millions) December31, 2013 Assets: Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges $  $ 3 $  $ 3 $ (2 ) $ 1 Liabilities: Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges $  $ 1 $  $ 1 Derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges  300  300 Total Derivative liabilities $  $ 301 $  $ 301 $ (2 ) $ 299 December31, 2012 Assets: Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges $  $ 48 $  $ 48 $ (15 ) $ 33 Liabilities: Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges $  $ 51 $  $ 51 Derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges  80  80 Total Derivative liabilities $  $ 131 $  $ 131 $ (15 ) $ 116 (1) The derivative fair values are based on analysis of each contract on a gross basis, even where the legal right of offset exists.
All derivative instruments are reflected as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet. These fair values are recorded by netting asset and liability positions where counterparty master netting arrangements contain provisions for net settlement.

OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES The following table provides detail of the Companys other current liabilities at December31, 2013 and 2012: December31, December31, 2013 2012 (In millions) Accrued operating expenses $ 190 $ 211 Accrued exploration and development 1,582 1,792 Accrued compensation and benefits 242 198 Accrued interest 161 160 Accrued income taxes 248 297 Accrued U.K. Petroleum Revenue Tax 9 53 Other 179 149 Total Other current liabilities $ 2,611 $ 2,860 5. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION The following table describes changes to the Companys asset retirement obligation (ARO) liability for the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012: 2013 2012 (In millions) Asset retirement obligation at beginning of year $ 4,578 $ 3,887 Liabilities incurred 481 592 Liabilities acquired 53 72 Liabilities divested (1,692 )  Liabilities settled (497 ) (550 ) Accretion expense 243 232 Revisions in estimated liabilities 56 345 Asset retirement obligation at end of year 3,222 4,578 Less current portion (121 ) (478 ) Asset retirement obligation, long-term $ 3,101 $ 4,100 The ARO liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with Apaches oil and gas properties. The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. The Company estimates the ultimate productive life of the properties, a risk-adjusted discount rate, and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance.
During 2013 and 2012, the Company recorded $481 million and $592 million, respectively, in abandonment liabilities resulting from Apaches active exploration and development capital program. Liabilities settled primarily relate to individual properties, platforms, and facilities plugged and abandoned during the period.
F-22 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 6. DEBT Overview All of the Companys debt is senior unsecured debt and has equal priority with respect to the payment of both principal and interest. The indentures for the notes described below place certain restrictions on the Company, including limits on Apaches ability to incur debt secured by certain liens and its ability to enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. Upon certain changes in control, all of these debt instruments would be subject to mandatory repurchase, at the option of the holders. None of the indentures for the notes contain prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.
During 2013, Apache repaid the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25 percent notes that matured on April15, 2013 and the $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00 percent notes that matured on September15, 2013 by borrowing under our commercial paper program.
In November 2013 the Company announced a cash tender offer to purchase up to $850 million aggregate principal amount of five series of its outstanding notes. On December20, 2013, the Company accepted for purchase $669 million principal amount of its 2.625 percent notes due 2023 and $181 million principal amount of its 3.25 percent notes due 2022. Apache paid the holders an aggregate of approximately $811 million in cash reflecting principal, the discount to par, and accrued and unpaid interest.
In December 2013, Apache Finance Canada Corporation (Apache Finance Canada) fully redeemed $350 million principal amount of its 4.375 percent notes due in 2015. The notes were redeemed pursuant to the provisions of the notes indenture. Apache paid the holders an aggregate of approximately $371 million in cash reflecting principal, the premium to par, and accrued and unpaid interest.
The Company recorded a net gain on extinguishment of debt totaling $16 million in connection with the cash tender offer and redemption of Apache Finance Canada notes.

The carrying amount of the Companys commercial paper and uncommitted credit facilities and overdraft lines approximate fair value because the interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates. Apache uses a market approach to determine the fair value of its fixed-rate debt using estimates provided by an independent investment financial data services firm (a Level 2 fair value measurement).

As of December31, 2013, a total of $53 million was drawn on facilities in Argentina and Canada. As of December31, 2012, a total of $91 million was drawn on facilities in the U.S., Argentina, and Canada.
Unsecured Committed Bank Credit Facilities As of December31, 2013, the Company had unsecured committed revolving syndicated bank credit facilities totaling $3.3billion, of which $1.0billion matures in August2016 and $2.3 billion matures in June 2017. The facilities consist of a $1.7billion facility and a $1.0 billion facility for the U.S., a $300million facility in Australia, and a $300million facility in Canada. In July 2013, we amended our $1.0 billion U.S. credit facility to conform certain representations, covenants, and events of default to those in our $1.7 billion U.S. credit facility. The amendments did not affect the amount or repayment terms of the $1.0 billion U.S. facility. As of December31, 2013, aggregate available borrowing capacity under the Companys credit facilities was $3.3billion. The committed credit facilities are used to support Apaches commercial paper program.
At the Companys option, the interest rate for the facilities is based on a base rate, as defined, or the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin determined by the Companys senior long-term debt rating. The $1.7 billion credit facility also allows the Company to borrow under competitive auctions.
F-25 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) At December31, 2013, the margin over LIBOR for committed loans was 0.875percent on the $1.0billion U.S. credit facility and 0.90percent on each of the $1.7 billion U.S. credit facility, the $300million Australian credit facility, and the $300 million Canadian credit facility. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees of 0.125percent on the total amount of the $1.0billion U.S. facility and 0.10percent on the total amount of the other three facilities. The facility fees vary based upon the Companys senior long-term debt rating.
The financial covenants of the credit facilities require the Company to maintain a debt-to-capitalization ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. At December31, 2013, the Companys debt-to-capitalization ratio was 22 percent.
The negative covenants include restrictions on the Companys ability to create liens and security interests on its assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens, and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics liens. The Company may incur liens on assets located in the U.S. and Canada of up to 5 percent of the Companys consolidated assets, or approximately $3.1 billion as of December31, 2013. There are no restrictions on incurring liens in countries other than the U.S. and Canada. There are also restrictions on Apaches ability to merge with another entity, unless the Company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on its ability to guarantee debt of entities not within its consolidated group.
The facilities do not permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes. The credit facility agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments and terminate lending commitments if Apache, or any of its U.S. or Canadian subsidiaries, defaults on any direct payment obligation in excess of the stated thresholds noted in the agreements or has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it in excess of the stated thresholds noted in the agreements.
The Company was in compliance with the terms of the credit facilities as of December31, 2013.
Commercial Paper Program The Company has available a $3.0billion commercial paper program, which generally enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270days at competitive interest rates. The commercial paper program is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under committed credit facilities. Our 2013 weighted-average interest rate for commercial paper was 0.38 percent. If the Company is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, the Companys committed credit facilities, which expire in 2016 and 2017, are available as a 100 percent backstop. The Company used proceeds from divestitures to repay commercial paper and at year end had no outstanding balance. At December31, 2012, the Company had $489 million in commercial paper outstanding.
Subsidiary Notes  Apache Finance Canada Apache Finance Canada has approximately $300 million of publicly-traded notes due in 2029 that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Apache. For further discussion of subsidiary debt, please see Note 16  Supplemental Guarantor Information.

Discount amortization of $3 million, $3 million, and $2 million were recorded as interest expense in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
As of December31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had approximately $73 million and $70 million, respectively, of unamortized deferred loan costs associated with its various debt obligations. These costs are included in deferred charges and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and are being charged to financing costs and expensed over the life of the related debt issuances.

The Company has assessed the future potential realization of these deferred tax assets and has concluded that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized based on current economic conditions. In 2013, 2012, and 2011, the Company increased its valuation allowance by $232 million, $359 million, and $7 million, respectively.
On November14, 2013, the Company completed the formation of its strategic partnership with Sinopec, whereby the Company received $2.95 billion in exchange for a one-third minority participation interest in F-28 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Apaches Egypt oil and gas business. As a result of the transaction, the Company reassessed its position with respect to certain current year untaxed foreign earnings to treat the reinvestment of these earnings as not permanent in duration. As such, the Company recorded a $225 million deferred tax charge on current year foreign earnings deemed not permanently reinvested. The Company repatriated approximately $643 million of cash from foreign subsidiaries and utilized net operating losses to offset any U.S. current income tax expense.
The Company considers the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested, as it has no current intention to repatriate these earnings. As such, deferred income taxes are not provided for temporary differences of approximately $17 billion at December31, 2013, representing unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside the United States intended to be permanently reinvested. Upon an actual or deemed distribution of these earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. It is not practicable, however, to estimate the amount of taxes that may be payable on the eventual remittance of these earnings after consideration of available foreign tax credits. Presently, limited foreign tax credits are available to reduce the U.S. taxes on such amounts if repatriated.
On December31, 2013, the Company had net operating losses as follows: December31, 2013 Amount Expiration (Inmillions) Net operating losses: U.S.  Federal $ 1,558 2032-2034 U.S.  Federal (Mariner IRC 382 limited) 520 2018 -2030 U.S.  Federal (Cordillera IRC 382 limited) 183 2026 -2032 U.S.  State 2,242 Various Canada 5 2014 Australia 59 Indefinite Argentina 299 2014 The Company has a federal net operating loss carryforward of $2.3 billion. Included in the federal net operating loss carryforward is $520 million of federal net operating losses related to the 2010 merger with Mariner and $183 million of federal net operating losses related to the Cordillera acquisition. The Mariner and Cordillera net operating loss carryforwards are subject to annual limitations under Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company also has $186 million of capital loss carryforwards in Canada, which have an indefinite carryover period.
The tax benefits of carryforwards are recorded as assets to the extent that management assesses the utilization of such carryforwards to be more likely than not. When the future utilization of some portion of the carryforwards is determined to not meet the more likely than not standard, a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the tax benefits from such assets. As discussed above, the Company does not believe the utilization of the Argentine net operating losses, Canadian capital losses, and certain state net operating losses to be more likely than not. As such, a valuation allowance was provided against these deferred tax assets.
F-29 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet before being recognized in the financial statements. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) Balance at beginning of year $ 3 $ 97 $ 110 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year  4 13 Reductions for tax positions of prior years  (33 ) (4 ) Settlements  (65 ) (22 ) Balance at end of year $ 3 $ 3 $ 97 The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Each quarter the Company assesses the amounts provided for and, as a result, may increase (expense) or reduce (benefit) the amount of interest and penalties. During the years ended December31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 the Company recorded tax expense of $1 million, $5 million, and $6 million, respectively, for interest and penalties. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had approximately $1 million and $5 million, respectively, accrued for payment of interest and penalties.
The Company is under IRS audit for 2011 and 2012 and under audit in various states as well as in most of the Companys foreign jurisdictions as part of its normal course of business. In 2013, the Company reached an agreement with the IRS regarding an audit of the 2009 and 2010 tax years. There was no change in the Companys unrecognized tax benefit as a result of the 2009 and 2010 IRS settlement. In 2012, the Company reached an agreement with the IRS Administrative Appeals office regarding the audits of tax years 2004 through 2008. As a result of this agreement, the Company reduced its 2012 unrecognized tax benefit by $65 million. The resolution of unagreed tax issues in the Companys open tax years cannot be predicted with absolute certainty, and differences between what has been recorded and the eventual outcomes may occur. The Company believes that it has adequately provided for income taxes and any related interest and penalties for all open tax years.
Apache and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Companys uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that may be subject to examination by the relevant taxing authority. Apaches earliest open tax years in its key jurisdictions are as follows: Jurisdiction U.S.
2010 Canada 2009 Egypt 1998 Australia 2009 U.K.
2011 Argentina 2006 8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Legal Matters Apache is party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, including litigation and governmental and regulatory controls. The Company has an accrued liability of approximately $10 million for all F-30 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) legal contingencies that are deemed to be probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated. Apaches estimates are based on information known about the matters and its experience in contesting, litigating, and settling similar matters. Although actual amounts could differ from managements estimate, none of the actions are believed by management to involve future amounts that would be material to Apaches financial position, results of operations, or liquidity after consideration of recorded accruals. For material matters that Apache believes an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, the Company has disclosed the nature of the matter and a range of potential exposure, unless an estimate cannot be made at this time. It is managements opinion that the loss for any other litigation matters and claims that are reasonably possible to occur will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
Argentine Environmental Claims In connection with the acquisition from Pioneer Natural Resources (Pioneer) in 2006, the Company acquired a subsidiary of Pioneer in Argentina (PNRA) that is involved in various administrative proceedings with environmental authorities in the Neuqun Province relating to permits for and discharges from operations in that province. In addition, PNRA was named in a lawsuit initiated against oil companies operating in the Neuqun basin entitled Asociacin de Superficiarios de la Patagonia v YPF S.A., et. al.
, originally filed on August21, 2003, in the Argentine National Supreme Court of Justice. The plaintiffs, a private group of landowners known as ASSUPA, have also named the national government and several provinces as third parties. The lawsuit alleges injury to the environment generally by the oil and gas industry. The plaintiffs principally seek from all defendants, jointly, (i)the remediation of contaminated sites, of the superficial and underground waters, and of soil that allegedly was degraded as a result of deforestation, (ii)if the remediation is not possible, payment of an indemnification for the material and moral damages claimed from defendants operating in the Neuqun basin, of which PNRA is a small portion, (iii)adoption of all the necessary measures to prevent future environmental damages, and (iv)the creation of a private restoration fund to provide coverage for remediation of potential future environmental damages. Much of the alleged damage relates to operations by the Argentine state oil company, which conducted oil and gas operations throughout Argentina prior to its privatization, which began in 1990. ASSUPA in 2012 asserted similar lawsuits and claims against numerous oil and gas producers relating to other geographic areas of Argentina, including claims against a Company subsidiary relating to the Austral basin.While the plaintiffs will seek to make all oil and gas companies jointly liable for each others actions in each of these lawsuits, Company subsidiaries will defend on an individual basis and attempt to require the plaintiffs to delineate damages by company. Company subsidiaries intend to defend each case vigorously. It is not certain exactly what the courts will do in these matters as the lawsuit relating to the Neuqun basin is the first of its kind. While it is possible Company subsidiaries may incur liabilities related to the environmental claims, no reasonable prediction can be made as the Company subsidiaries exposure related to these lawsuits is not currently determinable.
Argentine Tariff Enargas, an autonomous entity that functions under the Argentine Ministry of Economy, issued administrative orders pursuant to national executive Decree No.2067/2008 creating a tariff charge on all fuel gas used by oil and gas producers in field operations effective December1, 2011. The tariff charge, which is applicable to the operations of Company affiliates in Argentina, totaled approximately $39.5 million since inception, of which $11 million has been paid. The Companys affiliates have initiated legal proceedings in the Provinces of Neuqun and Tierra del Fuego challenging the Enargas tariff charge and have obtained temporary injunctive relief that prohibits the collection of the charges pending final rulings on the merits of the legal challenges.
F-31 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) U.S. Royalty Litigation In Foster v. Apache Corporation , Civil Action No. CIV-10-0573-HE, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, on August20, 2012, the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma denied plaintiffs motion for class certification. The plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration, which was also denied, and petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit to accept an appeal of the District Courts ruling denying class certification. The plaintiff withdrew the petition to appeal following decisions on July8, 2013, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit to vacate District Court class certification orders in two unrelated lawsuits Wallace B. Roderick Revocable Living Trust v. XTO Energy, Inc.
, No.12-3176, and Chieftain Royalty Company v. XTO Energy, Inc.
, No.12-7047. The plaintiff and Apache recently filed a joint stipulation to dismiss the Foster lawsuit with prejudice, which concludes the matter.
Louisiana Restoration Numerous surface owners have filed claims or sent demand letters to various oil and gas companies, including Apache, claiming that, under either expressed or implied lease terms or Louisiana law, they are liable for damage measured by the cost of restoration of leased premises to their original condition as well as damages from contamination and cleanup, regardless of the value of the underlying property. Because the Company has continuing operations in Louisiana, from time-to-time restoration lawsuits and claims are resolved by the Company for amounts that are not material to the Company while new lawsuits and claims are asserted against the Company. With respect to each of the pending lawsuits and claims, the amount claimed is not currently determinable or is not material, except that in a lawsuit captioned Ardoin Limited Partnership et al. v. Meridian Resources& Exploration et al.
, Case No.10-18692, in the District Court of Cameron Parish, Louisiana, the plaintiffs expert opined that the cost to restore plaintiffs property would be approximately $61 million. Prior to trial the court granted Apaches motions to dismiss the plaintiffs claims against Apache. Plaintiffs then settled with the other defendant in the case, BP America, Inc. (BP). BP has demanded that Apache indemnify it for the amount of its settlement with plaintiffs, which is not material to Apache. Apache has rejected BPs indemnity claim and, further, Apache has demanded that Wagner Oil Company (which purchased Apaches interest in the subject property) indemnify Apache from and against BPs claim.
On July24, 2013, a lawsuit captioned Board of Commissioners of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority  East v. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company et al.
, Case No.2013-6911 was filed in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans, State of Louisiana, in which plaintiff on behalf of itself and as the board governing the levee districts of Orleans, Lake Borgne Basin, and East Jefferson alleges that Louisiana coastal lands have been damaged as a result of oil and gas industry activity, including a network of canals for access and pipelines. The plaintiff seeks damages and injunctive relief in the form of abatement and restoration based on claims of negligence, strict liability, natural servitude of drain, public nuisance, private nuisance, and breach of contract  third party beneficiary. Apache has been indiscriminately named as one of approximately 100 defendants in the lawsuit. Defendant Chevron U.S.A., Inc. filed a notice to remove the case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, civil action No.13-5410. The overall exposure related to this lawsuit is not currently determinable. While an adverse judgment against Apache might be possible, Apache intends to vigorously defend the case.
On November8, 2013, the Parish of Plaquemines in Louisiana filed three lawsuits against the Company and other oil and gas producers alleging that certain of defendants oil and gas exploration, production, and transportation operations in specified fields were conducted in violation of the State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978, as amended, and applicable regulations, rules, orders, and ordinances promulgated or adopted thereunder by the State of Louisiana or the Parish of Plaquemines. The plaintiff alleges that defendants F-32 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) caused substantial damage to land and water bodies located in the coastal zone of Louisiana. The plaintiff seeks, among other things, unspecified damages for alleged violations of applicable state law within the coastal zone, the payment of costs necessary to clear, re-vegetate, detoxify, and otherwise restore the subject coastal zone as near as practicable to its original condition, and actual restoration of the coastal zone to its original condition. The lawsuits were all filed in Division A of the 25 th Judicial District Court for the Parish of Plaquemines, State of Louisiana, and are captioned as follows: Parish of Plaquemines v. Rozel Operating Company et al., Docket No.60-996; Parish of Plaquemines v. Apache Oil Corporation et al., Docket No.61-000; and Parish of Plaquemines v. HHE Energy Company et al., Docket No.60-983. Defendants have filed notices to remove the cases to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, civil action Nos. 13-6722, 13-6711, and 13-6735. The plaintiff has moved to remand each of the lawsuits to state court, and plaintiffs motions are pending. Many similar lawsuits have been filed against other oil and gas producers in the Parish of Plaquemines and in other Parishes across south Louisiana. The overall exposure related to these lawsuits is not currently determinable. While an adverse judgment against Apache might be possible, Apache intends to vigorously defend the cases.
The overall exposure related to these lawsuits and claims is not currently determinable. While an adverse judgment against Apache is possible, Apache intends to actively defend the cases.
Hurricane-Related Litigation On May27, 2011, a lawsuit captioned Comer et al. v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc. et al.
, Case No.1:11-cv-220 HS0-JMR, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, was filed in which certain named residents of Mississippi, as plaintiffs, alleged that the oil, coal, and chemical industries are responsible for global warming, which they claim caused or increased the effect of Hurricane Katrina, allegedly resulting among other things in economic losses and increased insurance premiums. Plaintiffs sought class certification, damages for losses sustained, a declaration that state law tort claims are not pre-empted by federal law, and punitive and exemplary damages. Apache was one of numerous defendants. The District Court granted defendants motion to dismiss plaintiffs claims. Plaintiffs appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which affirmed dismissal of the suit. Plaintiffs did not appeal further, thus concluding the matter. A similar action filed by Comer et al.
was previously dismissed in 2011.
Australia Gas Pipeline Force Majeure In June 2008, Company subsidiaries reported a pipeline explosion that interrupted deliveries of natural gas to customers under various long-term contracts. Company subsidiaries believe that the event was a force majeure, and as a result, the subsidiaries and their joint venture participants declared force majeure under those contracts.
On December16, 2009, a natural gas customer, Burrup Fertilisers Pty Ltd (Burrup Fertilisers), filed a lawsuit on behalf of itself and certain of its underwriters at Lloyds of London and other insurers, against the Company and its subsidiaries in Texas state court, in a case captioned Burrup Fertilisers Pty Ltd v. Apache Corporation, Apache Energy Limited, and Apache Northwest Pty Ltd, Cause No.2009-79834, in the District Court of Harris County, Texas. The lawsuit concerned the interruption of deliveries of natural gas to Burrup Fertilisers following the pipeline explosion. Burrup Fertilisers and its underwriters asserted claims for negligence, breach of contract, alter ego, single business enterprise, res ipsa loquitur, and gross negligence/exemplary damages, and sought to recover unspecified actual damages, cost of repair and replacement, exemplary damages, lost profits, loss of business goodwill, value of the gas lost under the Gas Supply and Purchase Agreement (GSA), interest, and court costs. On March22, 2013, Burrup Fertilisers agreed to dismiss its F-33 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Texas lawsuit based on Apache Corporations motion to dismiss on the ground of forum non conveniens . Accordingly, the District Court entered an agreed order dismissing Burrup Fertilisers Texas lawsuit on the ground of forum non conveniens . By its terms, the order of dismissal does not prevent Burrup Fertilisers from re-filing its lawsuit in the civil courts of Western Australia.
On March24, 2011, another natural gas customer, Alcoa of Australia Limited (Alcoa) filed a lawsuit captioned Alcoa of Australia Limited vs. Apache Energy Limited, Apache Northwest Pty Ltd, Tap (Harriet) Pty Ltd, and Kufpec Australia Pty Ltd , Civ. 1481 of 2011, in the Supreme Court of Western Australia. The lawsuit concerns the interruption of deliveries of natural gas to Alcoa under two long-term contracts. Alcoa challenges the declaration of force majeure and the validity of the liquidated damages provisions in the contracts. Alcoa asserts claims based on breach of contract, statutory duties, and duty of care. Alcoa seeks approximately $158 million AUD in general damages or, alternatively, approximately $5.7 million AUD in liquidated damages. On June20, 2012, the Supreme Court struck out Alcoas claim that the liquidated damages provisions under two long-term contracts are unenforceable as a penalty and also struck out Alcoas claim for damages for breach of statutory duty. On September17, 2013, the Western Australia Court of Appeal dismissed the Company subsidiaries appeal concerning Alcoas remaining tort claim for economic loss. On October15, 2013, the Company subsidiaries applied to the High Court of Australia for leave to appeal. The applications for leave to appeal are pending. If the High Court does not grant leave to appeal at this time, all of the Company subsidiaries defenses remain intact for further proceedings at the trial court level.
On October31, 2013, a third natural gas customer, Barrick (Plutonic) Limited (Barrick), filed a lawsuit captioned Barrick (Plutonic) Limited v. Apache Energy Limited, Apache Northwest Pty Ltd, Harriet (Onyx) Pty Ltd, and Kufpec Australia Pty Ltd , Civ. 2656 of 2013, in the Supreme Court of Western Australia. The lawsuit concerns the interruption of gas deliveries to Barrick under certain gas supply contracts. Barrick asserts tort claims against the Companys subsidiaries and seeks approximately $19 million USD in general damages, including for alleged lost gold production at the Plutonic mine in Western Australia.
The Company and its subsidiaries do not believe that the Burrup Fertilisers, Alcoa, and Barrick claims have merit and will vigorously pursue their defenses against such claims.
Other customers have threatened to file suit challenging the declaration of force majeure under their contracts. At least one third party that is not a customer has also threatened to file suit. Contract prices under customer contracts are significantly below current prices for natural gas in Australia. In the event it is determined that the pipeline explosion was not a force majeure, Company subsidiaries believe that liquidated damages should be the extent of the damages under those long-term contracts with such provisions. Approximately 90 percent of the natural gas volumes sold by Company subsidiaries under long-term contracts have liquidated damages provisions. Contractual liquidated damages under the long-term contracts with such provisions would not be expected to exceed $50 million AUD exclusive of interest. This is a reduction from the previous estimate of $200 million AUD. No assurance can be given that customers would not assert claims in excess of contractual liquidated damages, and exposure related to such claims (or any claims by non-customers) is not currently determinable. While an adverse judgment against Company subsidiaries (and the Company, in the case of Burrup Fertilisers) is possible, the Company and Company subsidiaries do not believe any such claims would have merit and plan to vigorously pursue their defenses against any such claims.
In December 2008, the Senate Economics Committee of the Parliament of Australia released its findings from public hearings concerning the economic impact of the gas shortage following the explosion on Varanus Island and the governments response. The Committee concluded, among other things, that the macroeconomic impact to Western Australia will never be precisely known, but cited to a range of estimates from $300 million F-34 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) AUD to $2.5 billion AUD consisting in part of losses alleged by some parties who have long-term contracts with Company subsidiaries (as described above), but also losses alleged by third parties who do not have contracts with Company subsidiaries (but who may have purchased gas that was re-sold by customers or who may have paid more for energy following the explosion or who lost wages or sales due to the inability to obtain energy or the increased price of energy). A timber industry group, whose members do not have a contract with Company subsidiaries, has announced that it intends to seek compensation for its members and their subcontractors from Company subsidiaries for $20 million AUD in losses allegedly incurred as a result of the gas supply shortage following the explosion. In Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v. Esso Australia Pty Ltd [2003] VSC 27 (Supreme Court of Victoria, Gillard J presiding), which concerned a 1998 explosion at an Esso natural gas processing plant at Longford in East Gippsland, Victoria, the Court held that Esso was not liable for $1.3 billion AUD of pure economic losses suffered by claimants that had no contract with Esso, but was liable to such claimants for reasonably foreseeable property damage which Esso settled for $32.5 million AUD plus costs. In reaching this decision the Court held that third-party claimants should have protected themselves from pure economic losses, through the purchase of insurance or the installation of adequate backup measures, in case of an interruption in their gas supply from Esso. While an adverse judgment against Company subsidiaries is possible if litigation is filed, Company subsidiaries do not believe any such claims would have merit and plan to vigorously pursue their defenses against any such claims. Exposure related to any such potential claims is not currently determinable.
On October10, 2008, the Australia National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority (NOPSA) released a self-titled Final Report of the findings of its investigation into the pipeline explosion, prepared at the request of the Western Australian Department of Industry and Resources (DoIR). NOPSA concluded in its report that the evidence gathered to date indicates that the main causal factors in the incident were: (1)ineffective anti-corrosion coating at the beach crossing section of the 12-inch sales gas pipeline, due to damage and/or dis-bondment from the pipeline; (2)ineffective cathodic protection of the wet-dry transition zone of the beach crossing section of the 12-inch sales gas pipeline; and (3)ineffective inspection and monitoring by Company subsidiaries of the beach crossing and shallow water section of the 12-inch sales gas pipeline. NOPSA further concluded that the investigation identified that Apache Northwest Pty Ltd and its co-licensees may have committed offenses under the Petroleum Pipelines Act 1969, Sections 36A& 38(b) and the Petroleum Pipelines Regulations 1970, Regulation 10, and that some findings may also constitute non-compliance with pipeline license conditions.
On May28, 2009, the Department of Mines and Petroleum (DMP) filed a prosecution notice in the Magistrates Court of Western Australia, charging Apache Northwest Pty Ltd and its co-licensees with failure to maintain a pipeline in good condition and repair under the Petroleum Pipelines Act 1969, Section38(b). The maximum fine associated with the alleged offense was $50,000 AUD. The Company subsidiary did not believe that the charge had merit and vigorously pursued its defenses, resulting in the dismissal of the prosecution notice by the Magistrates Court of Western Australia on March29, 2012.
NOPSA stated in its report that an application for renewal of the pipeline license (the pipeline license) covering the area of the Varanus Island facility was granted in May 1985 with 21 years validity, and an application for renewal of the pipeline license was submitted to DoIR by Company subsidiaries in December 2005 and remained pending at the time NOPSA issued its report. The application by Apache Northwest, Kufpec Australia Pty Ltd, and Tap (Harriet) Pty Ltd for renewal and variation of the pipeline license covering the area of the Varanus Island facility was granted on April19, 2011, by the DMP. The period of the pipeline license is 21 years commencing April20, 2011.
Company subsidiaries disagree with NOPSAs conclusions and believe that the NOPSA report was premature, based on an incomplete investigation, and misleading. In a July17, 2008, media statement, DoIR acknowledged, The pipelines and Varanus Island facilities have been the subject of an independent validation F-35 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) report [by Lloyds Register] which was received in August 2007. NOPSA has also undertaken a number of inspections between 2005 and the present. These and numerous other inspections, audits and reviews conducted by top international consultants and regulators did not identify any warnings that the pipeline had a corrosion problem or other issues that could lead to its failure. Company subsidiaries believe that the explosion was not reasonably foreseeable, and was not within the reasonable control of Companys subsidiaries or able to be reasonably prevented by Company subsidiaries.
On January9, 2009, the governments of Western Australia and the Commonwealth of Australia announced a joint inquiry to consider the effectiveness of the regulatory regime for occupational health and safety and integrity that applied to operations and facilities at Varanus Island and the role of DoIR, NOPSA, and the Western Australian Department of Consumer and Employment Protection. The joint inquirys report was published in June 2009.
On May8, 2009, the government of Western Australia announced that the DMP would carry out the final stage of investigations into the Varanus Island gas explosion. Inspectors were appointed under the Petroleum Pipelines Act to coordinate the final stage of the investigations. That report, prepared by the inspectors in June 2009, was made public by the State government on May24, 2012. Company subsidiaries disagree with the inspectors June 2009 conclusions. Two other government reports were not published by the State and were not referenced by the inspectors. The Magistrates Court of Western Australia subsequently ordered that both such reports could be released on the basis that the inspectors June 2009 report came with some limitations and the two other government reports together were part and parcel if not the main reason or the only reasoncertainly a significant contribution to the reason for the matter not proceeding to prosecution and trial. In the first such report, the States senior investigator said in February 2009 that the prospects of a successful prosecution of Apache for failing to maintain the pipeline would be slight. In the second such report, the States lead corrosion expert concluded in July 2011 that Apache had reasonable grounds to believe that the pipeline was in good repair prior to the explosion.
Breton Lawsuit On October4, 2011, plaintiffs filed suit in Breton Energy, L.L.C. et al. v. Mariner Energy Resources, Inc., et al.
, Case 4:11-cv-03561, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, seeking compensation from defendants for allegedly depriving plaintiffs of rights to hydrocarbons in a reservoir described by plaintiffs as a common reservoir in West Cameron Blocks 171 and 172 offshore Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico. In their original petition plaintiffs named, among others, Mariner Energy, Inc. and certain of its affiliates as defendants. On December12, 2011, plaintiffs filed an amended petition to add as defendants Apache Corporation and Apache Shelf, Inc. as successors to the Mariner interests. On September27, 2012, the court dismissed plaintiffs claims on various grounds, including for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, while granting plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint within 30 days. On October29, 2012, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On May28, 2013, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas dismissed the plaintiffs claims and entered judgment in favor of the defendants. On June3, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The appeal is pending. The exposure related to the re-filed lawsuit is not currently determinable. While an adverse judgment against Apache is possible, Apache intends to vigorously defend the case.
Escheat Audits The State of Delaware, Department of Finance, Division of Revenue (Unclaimed Property), has notified numerous companies, including Apache Corporation, that the State will examine its books and records and those of its subsidiaries and related entities to determine compliance with the Delaware Escheat Laws. The review is F-36 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) being conducted by Kelmar Associates on behalf of the State of Delaware. At least 30 other states have retained their own consultants and have sent similar notifications. The scope of each states audit varies. The State of Delaware advises, for example, that the scope of its examination will be for the period 1981 through the present. It is possible that one or more of the audits could extend to all 50 states. The exposure related to the audits is not currently determinable.
Burrup-Related Gas Supply Lawsuits On May19, 2011, a lawsuit captioned Pankaj Oswal et al. v. Apache Corporation , Cause No.2011-30302, in the District Court of Harris County, Texas, was filed in which plaintiffs asserted claims against the Company under the Australian Trade Practices Act. Following a hearing on March22, 2013, the District Court on April5, 2013, granted Apache Corporations motion to dismiss on the ground of forum non conveniens and entered an order dismissing the Texas lawsuit. On or about October11, 2013, a statement of claim captioned Pankaj Oswal v. Apache Corporation , No. WAD 389/2013, in the Federal Court of Australia, District of Western Australia, General Division, was filed in which plaintiff Oswal once again asserts claims against the Company under the Australian Trade Practices Act. The Western Australia lawsuit is one of a number of legal actions involving the Burrup Fertilisers ammonia plant in Western Australia (the Burrup plant) founded by Oswal. Oswals shares, and those of his wife, together representing 65 percent of Burrup Holdings Limited (BHL, which owns Burrup Fertilisers), were offered for sale by externally-appointed administrators in Australia as a result of events of default on loans made to the Oswals by the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ). In the Western Australia lawsuit, plaintiff Oswal alleges, among other things, that the Company induced him to make investments covering construction cost overruns on the ammonia plant that was completed in 2006. Plaintiff Oswal seeks damages in the amount of $491 million USD. The Company believes that the claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them.
The Texas and Western Australia lawsuits relate to a pending action filed by Tap (Harriet) Pty Ltd (Tap) against Burrup Fertilisers Pty Ltd et al., Civ. 2329 of 2009, in the Supreme Court of Western Australia (the Tap action), seeking a declaratory judgment regarding its contractual rights and obligations under a gas sales agreement between Burrup Fertilisers and the Harriet Joint Venture (comprised of a Company subsidiary and two joint venture partners, Tap and Kufpec Australia Pty Ltd).
As part of the sale process described above, on January31, 2012, a Company affiliate acquired a 49 percent interest in YPHPL, while Yara Australia Pty Ltd (Yara) increased its interest in YPHPL from 35 percent to 51 percent. Yara operates the ammonia plant and is proceeding with development of a technical ammonium nitrate (TAN) plant in the Burrup Peninsula region of Western Australia to be developed by a consortium including YPHPL. A Company affiliates existing agreement to supply gas to the ammonia plant has been modified (with, among other things, new pricing, delivery quantities, and term). YPHPL share ownership, and the modified gas supply agreement, continues to be the subject of ongoing litigation in Australia with third parties, including Pankaj and Radhika Oswal. Two such cases directly involve the Company or certain of its subsidiaries. In a case captioned Radhika Oswal v. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ) et al.
, No. SCI 2011 4653, in the Supreme Court of Victoria, the defendants include a Company affiliate. The Court has denied plaintiffs application seeking to amend her statement of claim in order to add parties as defendants to the proceedings, including the Company and certain of its other subsidiaries. Similarly, in a companion case captioned Pankaj Oswal v. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ) et al.
, No. SCI 2012 01995, in the Supreme Court of Victoria, the Court has also denied plaintiffs application seeking to amend his statement of claim in order to add parties as defendants to the proceedings, including the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The plaintiffs, either in their original claims or in their proposed amended claims, seek to set aside the YPHPL share sale, void the modified gas sale agreement, and recover unspecified damages. The plaintiffs in both cases have sought leave to appeal the Courts denial of their applications. The new gas supply F-37 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) agreement resolves counterclaims by Burrup Fertilisers against Apache and its affiliate in the Tap action. A Company subsidiary purchased Tap, which then modified its agreement to supply gas to the ammonia plant and resolved both Taps claims against Burrup Fertilisers and Burrup Fertilisers counterclaims against Tap in the Tap action. If Kufpec does not settle the remaining claims in the Tap action, it is expected that the trial court in the Tap action will issue its ruling in respect of phase 1 of those proceedings, which was tried in September 2011 and concerned construction of the original gas supply agreement.
Environmental Matters The Company, as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, is subject to various federal, provincial, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations and subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages. In some instances, the Company may be directed to suspend or cease operations in the affected area. We maintain insurance coverage, which we believe is customary in the industry, although we are not fully insured against all environmental risks.
Apache manages its exposure to environmental liabilities on properties to be acquired by identifying existing problems and assessing the potential liability. The Company also conducts periodic reviews, on a Company-wide basis, to identify changes in its environmental risk profile. These reviews evaluate whether there is a probable liability, the amount, and the likelihood that the liability will be incurred. The amount of any potential liability is determined by considering, among other matters, incremental direct costs of any likely remediation and the proportionate cost of employees who are expected to devote a significant amount of time directly to any possible remediation effort. As it relates to evaluations of purchased properties, depending on the extent of an identified environmental problem, the Company may exclude a property from the acquisition, require the seller to remediate the property to Apaches satisfaction, or agree to assume liability for the remediation of the property. The Companys general policy is to limit any reserve additions to any incidents or sites that are considered probable to result in an expected remediation cost exceeding $300,000. Any environmental costs and liabilities that are not reserved for are treated as an expense when actually incurred. In Apaches estimation, neither these expenses nor expenses related to training and compliance programs are likely to have a material impact on its financial condition.
As of December31, 2013, the Company had an undiscounted reserve for environmental remediation of approximately $93 million. Apache is not aware of any environmental claims existing as of December31, 2013 that have not been provided for or would otherwise have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. There can be no assurance however, that current regulatory requirements will not change or past non-compliance with environmental laws will not be discovered on the Companys properties.
On May25, 2011, a panel of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEMRE, as it was then known) published a report dated May23, 2011, and titled OCS G-2580, Vermilion Block 380 Platform A, Incidents of Noncompliance. The report concerned the BOEMREs investigation of a fire on the Vermilion 380 A platform located in the Gulf of Mexico. At the time of the incident, Mariner operated the platform. A small amount of hydrocarbons spilled from the platform into the surrounding water as a result of the incident, and 13 workers were rescued after evacuating the platform. The BOEMRE concluded in its investigation that the fire was caused by Mariners failure to adequately maintain or operate the platforms heater-treater in a safe condition. The BOEMRE also identified other safety deficiencies on the platform. On December27, 2011, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE, successor to BOEMRE) issued several Incidents of Non-Compliance, which may provide the basis for the assessment of civil penalties against Mariner. The Companys subsidiary F-38 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Apache Deepwater LLC, which acquired Mariner effective November10, 2010, filed an appeal on August31, 2012, contesting several of the Incidents of Non-Compliance. It is managements opinion that any loss arising from this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
On June1, 2013, Apache Canada Ltd. discovered a leak of produced water from a below ground pipeline in the Zama Operations area in northern Alberta. The pipeline was associated with a produced water disposal well. The spill resulted in approximately 97thousand barrels of produced water being released to the marsh land environment. The applicable government agencies were immediately notified of the event and the line was shut down. Apache Canada Ltd. investigated the leak while conducting clean up and monitoring activities in the affected area and communicating with appropriate parties, including regulatory and First Nation representatives. The investigation revealed a pinhole feature in the outer polyethylene liner of the composite flex line. While the exposure related to this incident is not currently determinable, the Company does not expect the economic impact of this incident to have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
Contractual Obligations At December31, 2013, contractual obligations for drilling rigs, purchase obligations, firm transportation agreements, and long-term operating leases are as follows: 2019 & Net Minimum Commitments Total 2014 2015-2016 2017-2018 Beyond (In millions) Drilling rig commitments(1) $ 974 $ 376 $ 429 $ 157 $ 12 Purchase obligations(2) 1,759 1,002 533 204 20 Firm transportation agreements(3) 683 158 223 129 173 Office and related equipment(4) 391 46 101 95 149 Other operating lease obligations(5) 686 190 295 193 8 Total Net Minimum Commitments $ 4,493 $ 1,772 $ 1,581 $ 778 $ 362 (1) Includes day-rate and other contractual agreements with third party service providers for use of drilling, completion, and workover rigs.
(2) Includes contractual obligations to buy or build oil and gas plants and facilities, LNG facilities, seismic and drilling work program commitments, take-or-pay contracts, and hydraulic fracturing services agreements.
(3) Relates to contractual obligations for capacity rights on third-party pipelines.
(4) Includes office and other building rentals and related equipment leases.
(5) Includes commitments required to retain acreage and commitments associated with floating production storage and offloading vessels (FPSOs), compressors, helicopters, and boats.
The table above includes leases for buildings, facilities, and related equipment with varying expiration dates through 2035. Net rental expense was $81 million, $76 million, and $64 million for 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
F-39 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 9. RETIREMENT AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS Apache Corporation provides retirement benefits to its U.S. employees through the use of multiple plans: a 401(k) savings plan, a money purchase retirement plan, a non-qualified retirement/savings plan, and a non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan. The 401(k) savings plan provides participating employees the ability to elect to contribute up to 50 percent of eligible compensation, as defined, to the plan with the Company making matching contributions up to a maximum of 8 percent of each employees annual eligible compensation. In addition, the Company annually contributes 6 percent of each participating employees annual eligible compensation to a money purchase retirement plan. The 401(k) savings plan and the money purchase retirement plan are subject to certain annually-adjusted, government-mandated restrictions that limit the amount of employee and Company contributions. For certain eligible employees, the Company also provides a non-qualified retirement/savings plan or a non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan. These plans allow the deferral of up to 50 percent of each employees base salary, up to 75 percent of each employees annual bonus (that accepts employee contributions) and the Companys matching contributions in excess of the government mandated limitations imposed in the 401(k) savings plan and money purchase retirement plan.
Vesting in the Companys contributions in the 401(k) savings plan, the money purchase retirement plan, the non-qualified retirement savings plan and the non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan occurs at the rate of 20 percent for every completed year of employment. Upon a change in control of ownership, immediate and full vesting occurs.
Additionally, Apache Energy Limited, Apache Canada Ltd., and Apache North Sea Limited maintain separate retirement plans, as required under the laws of Australia, Canada, and the U.K., respectively.
The aggregate annual cost to Apache of all U.S. and International savings plans, the money purchase retirement plan, non-qualified retirement/savings plan, and non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan was $123 million, $117 million, and $93 million for 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
Apache also provides a funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (U.K. Pension Plan) covering certain employees of the Companys North Sea operations in the U.K. The plan provides defined pension benefits based on years of service and final salary. The plan applies only to employees who were part of the BP North Seas pension plan as of April2, 2003, prior to the acquisition of BP North Sea by the Company effective July1, 2003.
Additionally, the Company offers postretirement medical benefits to U.S. employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Eligible participants receive medical benefits up until the age of 65, provided the participant remits the required portion of the cost of coverage. The plan is contributory with participants contributions adjusted annually. The postretirement benefit plan does not cover benefit expenses once a covered participant becomes eligible for Medicare.

Apaches defined benefit pension plan assets are held by a non-related trustee who has been instructed to invest the assets in an equal blend of equity securities and low-risk debt securities. The Company intends that this blend of investments will provide a reasonable rate of return such that the benefits promised to members are provided. The U.K. Pension Plan policy is to target an ongoing funding level of 100 percent through prudent investments and includes policies and strategies such as investment goals, risk management practices, and permitted and prohibited investments. A breakout of previous allocations for plan asset holdings and the target allocation for the Companys plan assets are summarized below: TargetAllocation Percentageof Plan Assetsat Year-End 2013 2013 2012 Asset Category Equity securities: U.K. quoted equities 17 % 18 % 16 % Overseas quoted equities 33 % 33 % 33 % Total equity securities 50 % 51 % 49 % Debt securities: U.K. Government bonds 30 % 29 % 30 % U.K. corporate bonds 20 % 20 % 20 % Debt securities 50 % 49 % 50 % Cash 0 % 0 % 1 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % F-42 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The plans assets do not include any direct ownership of equity or debt securities of Apache.

For the year ended December31, 2012, 14.3million shares related to the assumed conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock were also anti-dilutive.
Stock Repurchase Program In May 2013, Apaches Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 30million shares of the Companys common stock, valued at approximately $2 billion when first announced. Shares may be purchased either in the open market or through privately held negotiated transactions. The Company initiated the buyback program on June10, 2013, with the repurchase of 2,924,271 shares at an average price of $85.47 during the month of June. During the fourth quarter of 2013, 8,297,648 shares were repurchased at an average price of $90.08. An additional 2,393,917 shares were purchased subsequent to December31, 2013 at an average cost of $84.67. The Company anticipates that further purchases will primarily be made with proceeds from asset dispositions, but the Company is not obligated to acquire any specific number of shares.
Common Stock Dividend The Company paid common stock dividends of $0.77 per share in 2013, $0.66 per share in 2012, and $0.60 per share in 2011.
Stock Compensation Plans The Company has several stock-based compensation plans, which include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and conditional restricted stock unit plans. On May5, 2011, the Companys shareholders approved the 2011 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the 2011 Plan), which is intended to provide eligible employees with equity-based incentives. The 2011 Plan provides for the granting of Incentive Stock Options, Non-Qualified Stock Options, Performance Awards, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Stock Appreciation Rights, or any combination of the foregoing. A total of 27.3 million shares were authorized and available for grant under the 2011 Plan as of December 31, 2013. Previously approved plans remain in effect solely for the purpose of governing grants still outstanding that were issued prior to approval of the 2011 Plan. All new grants are issued from the 2011 Plan.
For 2013, 2012, and 2011, stock-based compensation expensed was $136 million, $167 million, and $113 million ($94 million, $119 million, and $73 million after tax), respectively. Costs related to the plans are capitalized or expensed based on the nature of each employees activities. A description of the Companys stock-based compensation plans and related costs follows: 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) Stock-based compensation expensed: General and administrative $ 89 $ 104 $ 69 Lease operating expenses 47 63 44 Stock-based compensation capitalized 55 67 42 $ 191 $ 234 $ 155 Stock Options As of December31, 2013, officers and employees held options to purchase shares of the Companys common stock under one or more of the employee stock option plans adopted in 2000 and 2005 (collectively, the Stock Option Plans), as well as the 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the 2007 Plan), and the 2011 Plan F-46 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) discussed above (together, the Omnibus Plans). New shares of Company stock will be issued for employee stock option exercises; however, under the 2000 Stock Option Plan, shares of treasury stock are used for employee stock option exercises to the extent treasury stock is held. Under the Stock Option Plans and the Omnibus Plans, the exercise price of each option equals the closing price of Apaches common stock on the date of grant. Options generally become exercisable ratably over a four-year period and expire 10 years after granted. The Omnibus Plans and all of the Stock Option Plans, except for the 2000 Stock Option Plan, were submitted to and approved by the Companys shareholders.
A summary of stock options issued and outstanding under the Stock Option Plans and the Omnibus Plans is presented in the table and narrative below: 2013 Shares UnderOption WeightedAverage Exercise Price (Inthousands) Outstanding, beginning of year 7,573 $ 90.47 Granted 819 80.89 Exercised (327 ) 72.55 Forfeited or expired (502 ) 97.88 Outstanding, end of year(1) 7,563 89.71 Expected to vest(1) 2,370 92.50 Exercisable, end of year(1) 4,678 88.53 Weighted average fair value of options granted during the year $ 23.18 (1) As of December31, 2013, the weighted average remaining contractual life for options outstanding, expected to vest, and exercisable is 6.1 years, 8.2 years, and 4.7 years, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding, expected to vest, and exercisable at year-end was $43 million, $7 million, and $34 million, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the years 2013, 2012, and 2011 was $23.18, $26.41, and $42.20, respectively.
The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Assumptions used in the valuation are disclosed in the following table. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Companys common stock and other factors. The expected dividend yield is based on historical yields on the date of grant. The expected term of stock options granted represents the period of time that the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is derived from historical exercise behavior, current trends, and values derived from lattice-based models. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
2013 2012 2011 Expected volatility 33.60 % 34.94 % 34.47 % Expected dividend yields 0.99 % 0.82 % 0.47 % Expected term (in years) 5.5 5.5 5.5 Risk-free rate 0.79 % 0.78 % 1.95 % The intrinsic value of options exercised during 2013, 2012, and 2011 was approximately $4 million, $12 million and $50 million, respectively. The cash received from exercise of options during 2013 was approximately F-47 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) $24 million. The Company realized an additional tax benefit of approximately $1.5 million for the amount of intrinsic value in excess of compensation cost recognized in 2013. As of December31, 2013, the total compensation cost related to non-vested options not yet recognized was $60 million, which will be recognized over the remaining vesting period of the options.
Stock Appreciation Rights For some non-executive employees, the Company issued stock appreciation rights (SARs) in lieu of stock options. The SARs vest ratably over four years and are settled in cash upon exercise throughout their ten-year life. In 2012, the Company issued 180,555 SARs with a weighted-average exercise price of $82.63 under the 2011 Omnibus Plan. As of December31, 2013, a total of 316,127 SARs were outstanding, of which 201,552 were exercisable. Since SARs are cash-settled, the Company records compensation expense based on the fair value of the SARs at the end of each period. As of year-end, the weighted-average fair value of SARs outstanding was $33.41 based on the Black-Scholes valuation methodology using assumptions comparable to those discussed above. During 2013, 237,288 SARs were exercised. The aggregate of cash payments made to settle SARs was $11 million.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units The Company has restricted stock and restricted stock unit plans for eligible employees including officers. The programs created under the Omnibus Plans have been approved by Apaches Board of Directors. In 2013, the Company awarded 3,098,029 restricted stock units at a weighted-average per-share market price of $82.95. In 2012 and 2011, the Company awarded 1,219,886 and 887,851 restricted stock units at a weighted-average per-share market price of $85.67 and $124.16, respectively. The value of the stock issued was established by the market price on the date of grant and is being recorded as compensation expense ratably over the vesting terms. During 2013, 2012, and 2011, $82 million ($53 million after tax), $74 million ($48 million after tax), and $76 million ($49 million after tax), respectively, was charged to expense. In 2013, 2012, and 2011, $30 million, $25 million, and $28 million was capitalized, respectively. As of December31, 2013, there was $242 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to 3,952,539 unvested restricted stock units. The weighted-average remaining life of unvested restricted stock units is approximately 1.3 years.
The fair value of the awards vested during 2013, 2012 and 2011 was approximately $88 million, $114 million, and $85 million, respectively. A summary of restricted stock activity for the year ended December31, 2013, is presented below.

The ultimate number of shares awarded from these conditional restricted stock units is based upon measurement of total F-48 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) shareholder return of Apache common stock as compared to a designated peer group during a three-year performance period. Should any restricted stock units be awarded at the end of the three-year performance period, 50 percent of restricted stock units awarded will immediately vest, and an additional 25 percent will vest on succeeding anniversaries of the end of the performance period. Grants from two conditional restricted stock unit programs were outstanding at December31, 2013, as described below:  In November 2010 the Companys Board of Directors approved the 2011 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2007 Plan. In January 2011 eligible employees received initial conditional restricted stock unit awards totaling 585,811 units. Based on measurement of total shareholder return relative to the designated peer group at December31, 2013, zero shares were awarded and all unvested conditional restricted stock units were cancelled. Upon cancellation, all remaining unamortized expense related to these awards was immediately amortized.
In January 2012 the Companys Board of Directors approved the 2012 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2011 Plan. In January 2012 eligible employees received initial conditional restricted stock unit awards totaling 851,985 units. A total of 710,686 units were outstanding at December31, 2013, from which a minimum of zero and a maximum of 1,776,715 units could be awarded.
In January 2013 the Companys Board of Directors approved the 2013 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2011 Plan. In January 2013 eligible employees received initial conditional restricted stock unit awards totaling 1,232,176 units. In May 2013, the Companys Board of Directors cancelled 918,016 awards under the 2013 Performance Program for nonexecutive employees. A total of 310,091 awards were outstanding at December31, 2013, from which a minimum of zero and a maximum of 775,228 units could be awarded.
The fair value cost of the awards was estimated on the date of grant and is being recorded as compensation expense ratably over the vesting terms. During 2013, 2012, and 2011, $27 million ($17 million after tax), $47 million ($31 million after tax), and $12 million ($8 million after tax), respectively, was charged to expense. During 2013, 2012, and 2011, $13 million, $21 million, and $5 million was capitalized, respectively. As of December31, 2013, there was $47 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to 1,020,777 unvested conditional restricted stock units. The weighted-average remaining life of the unvested conditional restricted stock units is approximately 2.1 years.

F-49 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Preferred Stock The Company has 10,000,000 shares of no par preferred stock authorized, of which 25,000 shares have been designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the Series A Preferred Stock). The Companys 6.00 percent Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series D (the Series D Preferred Stock) were converted to Apache common shares in August 2013.
Series A Preferred Stock In December 1995, the Company declared a dividend of one right (a Right) for each 2.31 shares (adjusted for subsequent stock dividends and a two-for-one stock split) of Apache common stock outstanding on January31, 1996. Each full Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one ten-thousandth (1/10,000)of a share of Series A Preferred Stock at a price of $100 per one ten-thousandth of a share, subject to adjustment. The Rights are exercisable 10 calendar days following a public announcement that certain persons or groups have acquired 20 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Apache common stock or 10 business days following commencement of an offer for 30 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Apaches outstanding common stock (flip-in event); each Right will become exercisable for shares of Apaches common stock at 50 percent of the then-market price of the common stock. If a 20-percent shareholder of Apache acquires Apache, by merger or otherwise, in a transaction where Apache does not survive or in which Apaches common stock is changed or exchanged (flip-over event), the Rights become exercisable for shares of the common stock of the Company acquiring Apache at 50 percent of the then-market price for Apache common stock. Any Rights that are or were beneficially owned by a person who has acquired 20 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Apache common stock and who engages in certain transactions or realizes the benefits of certain transactions with the Company will become void. If an offer to acquire all of the Companys outstanding shares of common stock is determined to be fair by Apaches board of directors, the transaction will not trigger a flip-in event or a flip-over event. The Company may also redeem the Rights at $.01 per Right at any time until 10 business days after public announcement of a flip-in event. These Rights were originally scheduled to expire on January31, 2006. Effective as of that date, the Rights were reset to one right per share of common stock and the expiration was extended to January31, 2016.
On February5, 2014, the Companys Board of Directors voted to terminate the Companys stockholder rights plan. As a result of this decision, the Board approved an amendment to the Rights Agreement that will have the effect of terminating the Rights. The amendment will change the expiration date to March7, 2014 and, thereby, accelerate the expiration of the Rights. The Company expects that the amendment will be fully executed on March7, 2014.
Series D Preferred Stock On July28, 2010, Apache issued 25.3million depositary shares, each representing a 1/20th interest in a share of Apaches 6.00-percent Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series D (Preferred Share), or 1.265million Preferred Shares. Upon conversion of the outstanding Preferred Shares on August1, 2013, 14.4million Apache common shares were issued.

Estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production-sharing arrangements utilizing the economic interest method, which excludes the host countrys share of reserves.
F-57 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Estimated reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques are included in the proved classification when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of an active, improved recovery program using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty for the engineering analysis on which the project or program is based. Economically producible means a resource which generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the operation. Reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field-tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In estimating its proved reserves, Apache uses several different traditional methods that can be classified in three general categories: 1) performance-based methods; 2) volumetric-based methods; and 3) analogy with similar properties. Apache will, at times, utilize additional technical analysis such as computer reservoir models, petrophysical techniques, and proprietary 3-D seismic interpretation methods to provide additional support for more complex reservoirs. Information from this additional analysis is combined with traditional methods outlined above to enhance the certainty of our reserve estimates.
F-58 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures.

F-62 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) During 2013, Apache added 6 MMboe of estimated proved reserves through purchases of minerals in-place. We sold 355 MMboe through several divestiture transactions which included the majority of our Gulf of Mexico Shelf properties and certain fields in Canada. During 2013, Apache also added 389 MMboe from extensions, discoveries and other additions. In the U.S., the Company recorded 254 MMboe primarily associated with drilling successes in the Permian and Anadarko basins, which added 150 MMboe and 65 MMboe, respectively; 20 MMboe from appraisal drilling in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico; and 19 MMboe from various drilling programs in other U.S. regions. In Canada, additions of 74 MMboe were primarily a result of drilling activity for liquids-rich gas targets in the Kaybob field area, horizontal drilling in our House Mountain waterflood units, extensions of the Glauconitic trend in our West 5 area and shallow oil drilling in Brownfield and Consort field areas. Egypt contributed 51 MMboe from exploration and appraisal activity in the West Kalabsha, Shushan, Khalda and Ras Kanayes concessions along with continued development of the Razzak, Abu Gharadig and Meghar fields. Australia, Argentina and North Sea regions contributed 11 MMboe from their combined drilling programs.
Approximately 10 percent of Apaches year-end 2013 estimated proved developed reserves are classified as proved not producing. These reserves relate to zones that are either behind pipe, or that have been completed but not yet produced, or zones that have been produced in the past, but are not now producing because of mechanical reasons. These reserves are considered to be a lower tier of reserves than producing reserves because they are frequently based on volumetric calculations rather than performance data. Future production associated with behind pipe reserves is scheduled to follow depletion of the currently producing zones in the same wellbores. Additional capital may have to be spent to access these reserves. The capital and economic impact of production timing are reflected in this Note 14, under Future Net Cash Flows.
Future Net Cash Flows Future cash inflows as of December31, 2013 and 2012 were calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of oil and gas prices in effect on the first day of each month in the respective year, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation.
F-63 Table of Contents APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The following table sets forth unaudited information concerning future net cash flows for proved oil and gas reserves, net of income tax expense. Income tax expense has been computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available, under current laws, and which relate to oil and gas producing activities. This information does not purport to present the fair market value of the Companys oil and gas assets, but does present a standardized disclosure concerning possible future net cash flows that would result under the assumptions used.
