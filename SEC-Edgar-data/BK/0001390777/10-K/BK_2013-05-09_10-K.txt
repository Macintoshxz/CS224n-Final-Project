For a further discussion of BNY Mellons products and services, see the Overview and Review of businesses sections in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) section in the Annual Report and Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report, which portions are incorporated herein by reference. See Available Information on page 1 of this Form 10-K for a description of how to access financial and other information regarding BNY Mellon, which is incorporated herein by reference.
We were formed as a bank holding company and have our executive offices in New York. With its predecessors, BNY Mellon has been in business since 1784.
On July1, 2007, The Bank of New York Company, Inc. and Mellon Financial Corporation (Mellon Financial) merged into BNY Mellon, with BNY Mellon being the surviving entity.
Our two principal banks are:  The Bank of New York Mellon, a New York state chartered bank, formerly named The Bank of New York, which houses our institutional businesses, including Asset Servicing, Issuer Services, Treasury Services, Broker-Dealer and Advisor Services and the bank-advised business of Asset Management.
BNY Mellon, National Association (BNY Mellon, N.A.), a nationally-chartered bank, formerly named Mellon Bank, N.A., which houses our Wealth Management business.
Our U.S. bank subsidiaries engage in trust and custody activities, investment management services, banking services and various securities-related activities. The deposits of the U.S. banking subsidiaries are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to the extent provided by law.
We have two U.S. trust companies  The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association and BNY Mellon Trust Company of Illinois. These companies house trust products and services across the U.S. Also concentrating on trust products and services is BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware, a Delaware bank. Most asset management businesses, along with our Pershing businesses, are direct or indirect non-bank subsidiaries of BNY Mellon.

Note 4 is incorporated herein by reference. All information in this Form 10-K, including all supplemental information, reflects continuing operations unless otherwise noted.
Supervision and Regulation BNY Mellon, including through its subsidiaries, engages in banking, investment advisory and other securities-related activities in the United States and 4 BNY Mellon Table of Contents approximately 35 other countries. We are subject to extensive regulation worldwide. Regulatory bodies around the world are generally charged with protecting the interests of customers, including depositors in banking entities and investors in mutual funds and other vehicles our subsidiaries may advise, and safeguarding the integrity of securities and other financial markets. They are not, however, generally charged with protecting the interests of our shareholders or creditors. Described below are the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to BNY Mellon and its subsidiaries. The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described. Changes in applicable law or regulation, and in their application by regulatory agencies, cannot be predicted, but they may have a material effect on the business and results of BNY Mellon and its subsidiaries. For additional discussion of recent and proposed regulatory initiatives that may impact our business, see Recent Accounting and Regulatory Developments in the MD&A section of the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
The events of the past few years have led to numerous new laws in the United States and internationally for financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act or Dodd-Frank), which was enacted in July 2010, significantly restructures the financial regulatory regime in the United States, including through the creation of a new systemic risk oversight body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). The FSOC will coordinate the efforts of the primary U.S. financial regulatory agencies (including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC), the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC) and the FDIC) in establishing regulations to address financial stability concerns. The Dodd-Frank Act directs the FSOC to make recommendations to the Federal Reserve Board as to supervisory requirements and heightened prudential standards applicable to large, interconnected bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve Board under Dodd-Frank, often referred to as systemically important financial institutions, including capital, leverage, liquidity and risk-management requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates that the requirements applicable to systemically important financial institutions be more stringent than those applicable to other financial companies. Although the criteria for treatment as a systemically important financial institution have not yet been determined, it is probable that they will apply to BNY Mellon.
In addition to the framework for systemic risk oversight implemented through the FSOC, the Dodd-Frank Act broadly affects the financial services industry by creating a resolution authority, and through numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector. As discussed further throughout this section, many aspects of Dodd-Frank are subject to further rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on BNY Mellon or across the industry. In addition to the discussion in this section, see Risk Factors  Recent legislative actions may have an adverse effect on the Companys operations. in Part I, Item1A of this Form 10-K.
Regulated Entities of BNY Mellon BNY Mellon is regulated as a bank holding company and a financial holding company (FHC) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended by the 1999 financial modernization legislation known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and by the Dodd-Frank Act (the BHC Act). As such, it is subject to the supervision of the Federal Reserve Board. In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies that are FHCs to banking, managing or controlling banks, performing certain servicing activities for subsidiaries, engaging in activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined, by order or regulation, are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto, and, as a result of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act amendments to the BHC Act, engaging in any activity, or acquiring and retaining the shares of any company engaged in any activity, that is either (1)financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the Federal Reserve Board in consultation with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department) or (2)complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as solely determined by the Federal Reserve Board). Activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial companies.
Our ability to maintain FHC status is dependent upon a number of factors, including our U.S. depository institution subsidiaries continuing to qualify as well capitalized as described under Prompt Corrective Action below. Beginning in July 2011, our FHC status will also depend upon BNY Mellon BNY Mellon 5 Table of Contents maintaining its status as well capitalized and well managed under applicable Federal Reserve Board regulations. An FHC that does not continue to meet all the requirements for FHC status will, depending on which requirements it fails to meet, lose the ability to undertake new activities or make acquisitions that are not generally permissible for bank holding companies without FHC status or to continue such activities. Currently, we meet these requirements.
The Bank of New York Mellon, which is BNY Mellons largest bank subsidiary, is a New York state chartered bank, is a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board and the New York State Banking Department (the NYSBD). BNY Mellons national bank subsidiaries, BNY Mellon, N.A. and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association, are subject to primary supervision, regulation and examination by the OCC.
We operate a number of broker-dealers that engage in securities underwriting and other broker-dealer activities. These companies are SEC registered broker-dealers and members of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA), a securities industry self-regulatory organization. BNY Mellons non-bank subsidiaries engaged in securities-related activities are regulated by supervisory agencies in the countries in which they conduct business. Certain of BNY Mellons public finance activities are regulated by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. Certain of BNY Mellons subsidiaries are registered with the CFTC as commodity pool operators or commodity trading advisors and, as such, are subject to CFTC regulation.
Certain of our subsidiaries are registered investment advisors under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended and, as such, are supervised by the SEC. They are also subject to various U.S. federal and state laws and regulations and to the laws and regulations of any countries in which they conduct business. These laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the carrying on of business for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. Our subsidiaries advise both public investment companies which are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 40 Act), including the Dreyfus family of mutual funds, and private investment companies which are not registered under the 40 Act. The shares of most investment companies advised by our subsidiaries are qualified for sale in all states in the U.S. and the District of Columbia, except for investment companies that offer products only to residents of a particular state or of a foreign country and except for certain investment companies which are exempt from such registration or qualification.
Our financial services operations in the United Kingdom are subject to regulation by and supervision of the Financial Services Authority (FSA). Certain of BNY Mellons United Kingdom incorporated subsidiaries are authorized to conduct investment business in the U.K. pursuant to the U.K. Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA 2000). Their investment management advisory activities and their sale and marketing of retail investment products are regulated by the FSA. The FSA has broad supervisory and disciplinary powers. Disciplinary powers include the power to temporarily or permanently revoke the authorization to carry on regulated business following a breach of FSMA 2000 and/or regulatory rules, the suspension of registered employees and censures and fines for both regulated businesses and their registered employees. Certain U.K. investment funds, including BNY Mellon Investment Funds, an open-ended investment company with variable capital advised by U.K. regulated subsidiaries of BNY Mellon, are registered with the FSA and are offered for retail sale in the U.K.
The types of activities in which the foreign branches of our banking subsidiaries and our international subsidiaries may engage are subject to various restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Board. Those foreign branches and international subsidiaries are also subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the countries in which they operate and, in the case of banking subsidiaries, may be subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate. As of Dec. 31, 2010, each of BNY Mellons non-U.S. banking subsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified minimum requirements.
Dividend Restrictions Dividend payments by BNY Mellon to its shareholders are subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve Board. On Nov. 17, 2010, the Federal Reserve Board issued Revised Temporary Addendum to SR letter 09-4. The letter described the process the Federal Reserve Board will follow to assess comprehensive capital plans of the 19 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program bank holding companies, including any request to take capital 6 BNY Mellon Table of Contents actions such as increased dividends or stock buybacks. The Federal Reserve Board indicated that the capital plans will be assessed against, among other things, the bank holding companys ability to achieve the Basel III capital ratio requirements referred to below as they are phased in by U.S. regulators and any potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the companys risk profile, business strategy, corporate structure or capital adequacy. Our comprehensive capital plans, which were prepared using Basel I capital guidelines, included bank developed baseline and stress projections as well as a supervisory stress projection using adverse macroeconomic assumptions provided by the Federal Reserve Board. Any increase in BNY Mellons ongoing quarterly dividends would require consultation with the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Boards current guidance provides that, for large bank holding companies like us, dividend payout ratios exceeding 30% of after-tax net income will receive particularly close scrutiny.
BNY Mellon is a legal entity separate and distinct from its bank subsidiaries and other subsidiaries. Dividends and interest from our subsidiaries are our principal sources of funds to make capital contributions or loans to our bank subsidiaries and other subsidiaries, to pay service on our own debt, to honor our guarantees of debt issued by our subsidiaries or of trust preferred securities issued by a trust or to pay dividends on our own equity securities. Various federal and state statutes and regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to us by our bank subsidiaries without regulatory consent. If, in the opinion of the applicable federal regulatory agency, a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the financial condition of the bank, could include the payment of dividends), the regulator may require, after notice and hearing, that the bank cease and desist from such practice. The OCC, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have indicated that the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice if the payment would reduce a depository institutions capital to an inadequate level. Moreover, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (the FDI Act), an insured depository institution may not pay any dividends if the institution is under capitalized or if the payment of the dividend would cause the institution to become undercapitalized. In addition, the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued policy statements which provide that FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings.
In general, the amount of dividends that may be paid by The Bank of New York Mellon or BNY Mellon, N.A. is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared and paid by the entity in any calendar year exceeds the current years net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the entity obtains prior regulatory approval. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entitys undivided profits (generally, accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus). As a result of charges related to the restructuring of BNY Mellons securities portfolio in 2009, The Bank of New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A. will require regulatory consent prior to paying a dividend. The ability of BNY Mellons bank subsidiaries to pay dividends to BNY Mellon may also be affected by various minimum capital requirements for banking organizations.
For a further discussion of restrictions on dividends, see the Liquidity and dividends section in the MD&A  Results of Operations section in the Annual Report and the first five paragraphs of Note21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report, which are incorporated herein by reference. Further, BNY Mellons right to participate in the assets or earnings of a subsidiary is subject to the prior claims of creditors of the subsidiary.
Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders Transactions between BNY Mellons bank subsidiaries and BNY Mellon and its non-bank subsidiaries are regulated by the Federal Reserve Board. These regulations limit the types and amounts of transactions (including loans due and extensions of credit from the U.S. bank subsidiaries) that may take place and generally require those transactions to be on an arms-length basis. These regulations generally do not apply to transactions between a U.S. bank subsidiary and its subsidiaries. In general, these restrictions require that any extensions of credit must be secured by designated amounts of specified BNY Mellon 7 Table of Contents collateral and are limited, as to any one of BNY Mellon or such non-bank affiliates, to 10% of the lending banks capital stock and surplus, and, as to BNY Mellon and all such non-bank affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of such lending banks capital stock and surplus. These restrictions, other than the 10% of capital limit on covered transactions with any one affiliate, are also applied to transactions between banks and their financial subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expands the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization. For example, commencing in July 2012, the Dodd-Frank Act will require that the 10% of capital limit on covered transactions begin to apply to financial subsidiaries. Commencing in July 2012, Dodd-Frank has also expanded the definition of a covered transaction to include derivatives transactions under which a bank (or a subsidiary) has credit exposure (with the term credit exposure to be defined by the Federal Reserve Board under its existing rulemaking authority), as well as repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements.
Deposit Insurance Our U.S. banking subsidiaries, including The Bank of New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A. accept deposits, and those deposits have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limits. The FDICs Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF) is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions, which depend on the risk category of an institution and the amount of insured deposits that it holds. The FDIC required all insured depository institutions to prepay estimated assessments for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012 on December 30, 2009. The FDIC may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a semi-annual basis. Under the FDI Act, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a banks federal regulatory agency.
On Feb. 7, 2011, the FDIC adopted regulations required under the Dodd-Frank Act which set forth a new method of calculating assessments paid by large insured depository institutions, including BNY Mellon. The new regulations base insurance assessments on the average consolidated assets less the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period, with adjustments for custody banks, including BNY Mellon. We expect the FDIC assessment rule to have a minimal impact in 2011. For additional discussion about FDIC assessments, see Recent Accounting and Regulatory Developments in the MD&A section of the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Source of Strength and Liability of Affiliates Federal Reserve Board policy historically has required bank holding companies to act as a source of strength to their bank subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to support those subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act codifies this policy as a statutory requirement. Such support may be required by the Federal Reserve Board at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it. In addition, any loans by BNY Mellon to its bank subsidiaries would be subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of its banks. In the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulator to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. In addition, in certain circumstances BNY Mellons insured depository institutions could be assessed for losses incurred by another BNY Mellon insured depository institution. In the event of impairment of capital stock of one of BNY Mellons national banks or The Bank of New York Mellon, the banks stockholders could be required to pay such deficiency.
Capital Requirements As a bank holding company, we are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve Board. Our bank subsidiaries are subject to similar capital requirements, administered by the Federal Reserve Board in the case of The Bank of New York Mellon and by the OCC in the case of our national bank subsidiaries, BNY Mellon, N.A. and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association. These requirements are intended to ensure that banking organizations have adequate capital given the risk levels of their assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments.
The risk-based capital guidelines currently applicable to bank holding companies are based on the 1988 Capital Accord (Basel I) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee). The federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted new risk-based capital guidelines for core banks, including BNY Mellon, based upon the Revised Framework for the International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards (Basel II) issued by the Basel Committee in June 2004 and updated in November 2005. In December 2010, the Basel Committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity 8 BNY Mellon Table of Contents regulation, now officially identified by the Basel Committee as Basel III. Basel III, when implemented by the U.S. banking agencies and fully phased-in, will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity. Additional information on the calculation of our Tier 1 capital, Total capital and risk-weighted assets is set forth in Capital in the MD&A  Results of Operations section in the Annual Report, and additional information on our capital requirements is set forth in Recent Accounting and Regulatory Developments in the MD&A section in the Annual Report, which are incorporated herein by reference.
Basel I Under the existing Basel I-based regulations, the risk-based capital ratio is determined by dividing the components of capital, described further below, by risk-adjusted assets (including certain off-balance sheet items, such as standby letters of credit). The regulatory capital rules state that voting common stockholders equity should be the predominant element within Tier 1 capital and that banking organizations should avoid overreliance on non-common equity elements. Risk-adjusted assets are determined by classifying assets and certain off-balance sheet items into weighted categories. The required minimum ratio of Total capital (the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) to risk-adjusted assets is currently 8%. The required minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted assets is 4%. The risk-based capital rules state that the capital requirements are minimum standards based primarily on broad credit-risk considerations and do not take into account the other types of risk a banking organization may be exposed to ( e.g.
, interest rate, market, liquidity and operational risks). The Federal Reserve Board may, therefore, set higher capital requirements for categories of banks ( e.g.
systematically important financial institutions), or for an individual bank as situations warrant. For example, holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. Other factors identified by the risk-based capital requirements as important in assessing an institutions overall capital adequacy include concentration of credit risk and certain risks arising from non-traditional activities, including the management of those risks. At Dec. 31, 2010, BNY Mellons Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted assets and Total capital ratios were 13.4% and 16.3%, respectively.
In addition, the risk-based capital guidelines incorporate a measure for market risk in foreign exchange and commodity activities and in the trading of debt and equity instruments. The market risk-based capital guidelines require banking organizations with large trading activities to maintain capital for market risk in an amount calculated by using the banking organizations own internal value-at-risk models, subject to parameters set by the regulators. In January 2011, the Federal Banking Agencies published proposed amendments to their market risk rules, known as Basel II.5. Those changes will result in increased capital requirements for market risk.
Basel II The federal bank regulatory agencies are mandating the adoption of Basel II for core banks. BNY Mellon and its depository institution subsidiaries are core banks. The only approach available to core banks is the Advanced Internal Ratings Based (A-IRB) approach for credit risk and the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) for operational risk.
The U.S. Basel II final rule became effective on April1, 2008. Under the final rule in its current form, 2009 was the first year for a bank to begin its first of three transitional floor periods during which banks subject to the final rule calculate their capital requirements under both the old regulations and new regulations. The U.S. Basel II rules currently provide that core banks would calculate their capital requirements only under the new Basel II-based requirements after completion of the three transitional floor periods. In the U.S., we began the parallel run of calculations under both the old and new guidelines in the second quarter of 2010. Dodd-Frank requires the U.S. banking agencies to amend their capital rules to provide that minimum capital as required under the BaselI-based rules will act as a floor for minimum capital requirements calculated in accordance with the U.S. Basel II rules. Accordingly, the transition for core banks to calculations only under the Basel II-based requirements is being eliminated. Beginning Jan. 1, 2008, we implemented the Basel II Standardized Approach for our banks organized in the United Kingdom, Belgium and Luxembourg. We maintain an active dialogue with U.S. and international regulatory jurisdictions to facilitate a smooth Basel II reporting process. We believe BaselII will not constrain our current business practices.
Basel III The Basel III final capital framework, among other things: BNY Mellon 9 Table of Contents  introduces as a new capital measure Common Equity Tier 1 , or CET1, specifies that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital instruments meeting specified requirements, defines CET1 narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, and expands the scope of the adjustments as compared to existing regulations;  when fully phased in on Jan. 1, 2019, requires banks to maintain:  as a newly adopted international standard, a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%);  a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation);  a minimum ratio of Total (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation);  as a newly adopted international standard, a minimum leverage ratio of 3%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter); and  provides for a countercyclical capital buffer, generally to be imposed when national regulators determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk, that would be a CET1 add-on to the capital conservation buffer in the range of 0% to 2.5% when fully implemented (potentially resulting in total buffers of between 2.5% and 5%).
The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.
The implementation of the Basel III final framework will commence Jan. 1, 2013. On that date, banking institutions will be required to meet the following minimum capital ratios:  3.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;  4.5% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets; and  8.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets.
The Basel III final framework provides for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1.
Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 will begin on Jan. 1, 2014 and will be phased-in over a five-year period (20% per year). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on Jan. 1, 2016 at 0.625% and be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent Jan. 1, until it reaches 2.5% on Jan. 1, 2019).
The U.S. banking agencies have indicated informally that they expect to propose regulations implementing Basel III in mid-2011 with final adoption of implementing regulations in mid-2012. Notwithstanding its release of the Basel III framework as a final framework, the Basel Committee is considering further amendments to Basel III, including the imposition of additional capital surcharges on globally systemically important financial institutions, which could include BNY Mellon. In addition to Basel III, Dodd-Frank requires the Federal banking agencies to adopt regulations affecting banking institutions capital requirements in a number of respects, including potentially more stringent capital requirements for systemically important financial institutions. Accordingly, the regulations ultimately applicable to us may be substantially different from the Basel III final framework as published in December 2010.
10 BNY Mellon Table of Contents Impact on BNY Mellon Given that the Basel III rules are subject to change, and the scope and content of capital regulations that the U.S. banking agencies may adopt under Dodd-Frank is uncertain, we cannot be certain of the impact new capital regulations will have on our capital ratios. However, given our balance sheet strength and ongoing internal capital generation, we currently estimate that our Tier 1 common ratio, under Basel III guidelines, will be above 7% by Dec. 31, 2011. This estimated ratio includes an anticipated dividend increase and potential share repurchases in 2011, assuming Federal Reserve Board approval.
Leverage Requirement Basel I and Basel II do not include a leverage requirement as an international standard. However, even though a leverage requirement has not been an international standard in the past, the U.S. banking agencies capital regulations do require bank holding companies and banks to comply with a minimum leverage ratio requirement (Basel III will impose a leverage requirement as an international standard). The Federal Reserve Boards existing leverage ratio for bank holding companies is that the bank holding company maintain a ratio of Tier 1 capital to its total consolidated quarterly average assets (as defined for regulatory purposes), net of the loan loss reserve, goodwill and certain other intangible assets. The rules require a minimum leverage ratio of 3% for bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the Federal Reserve Boards risk-adjusted measure for market risk. All other bank holding companies are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4%. The Federal Reserve Board has not advised us of any specific minimum leverage ratio applicable to us. At Dec. 31, 2010, our leverage ratio was 5.8%. Also, the rules indicate that the Federal Reserve Board will consider a tangible Tier 1 leverage ratio in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities. The tangible Tier 1 leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organizations Tier 1 capital (excluding intangibles) to total assets (excluding intangibles).
Liquidity Ratios under Basel III Historically, regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, both in the U.S. and internationally, without required formulaic measures. The Basel III final framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going forward will be required by regulation. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio, is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entitys expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other, referred to as the net stable funding ratio, is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. These requirements will incentivize banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source. The liquidity coverage ratio would be implemented subject to an observation period beginning in 2011, but would not be introduced as a requirement until Jan. 1, 2015, and the net stable funding ratio would not be introduced as a requirement until Jan. 1, 2018. These new standards are subject to further rulemaking and their terms may well change before implementation.
Prompt Corrective Action The FDI Act, as amended by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), requires the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks: well-capitalized, adequately-capitalized, under-capitalized, significantly under-capitalized and critically under-capitalized. A depository institution is deemed to be well capitalized if the banking institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and the institution is not subject to an order, written agreement, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific level for any capital measure. The FDI Act imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified.
At Dec. 31, 2010, all of our bank subsidiaries were well capitalized based on the ratios and guidelines noted above. A banks capital category, however, is determined solely for the purpose of applying the prompt corrective action rules and may not be an accurate representation of the banks overall financial condition or prospects.
BNY Mellon 11 Table of Contents Depositor Preference Under federal law, depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution are afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution, including federal funds and letters of credit, in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver.
Anti-Money Laundering and the USA Patriot Act A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the USA Patriot Act) substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the U.S. The U.S. Treasury Department has proposed and, in some cases, issued a number of implementing regulations which apply various requirements of the USA Patriot Act to financial institutions such as BNY Mellons bank, broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries and mutual funds and private investment companies advised or sponsored by our subsidiaries. Those regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Certain of those regulations impose specific due diligence requirements on financial institutions that maintain correspondent or private banking relationships with non-U.S. financial institutions or persons. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution.
Privacy The privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act generally prohibit financial institutions, including BNY Mellon, from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes (primarily marketing) unless customers have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure. The Fair Credit Reporting Act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes.
Acquisitions Federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions involving depository institutions or bank holding companies. The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board for the direct or indirect acquisition of more than 5.0% of any class of the voting shares or all or substantially all of the assets of a commercial bank, savings and loan association or bank holding company. In reviewing bank acquisition and merger applications, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect of the transaction, financial and managerial issues including the capital position of the combined organization, convenience and needs factors, including the applicants record under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 which requires U.S. banks to help serve the credit needs of their communities (including credit to low and moderate income individuals and geographies) and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities. In addition, other acquisitions by BNY Mellon may be subject to informal notice and approval by the Federal Reserve Board or other regulatory authorities.
Competition BNY Mellon is subject to intense competition in all aspects and areas of our business. Our Asset Management and Wealth Management businesses experience competition from asset management firms, hedge funds, investment banking companies, and other financial services companies, including trust banks, brokerage firms, and insurance companies. These firms and companies may be domiciled domestically or internationally. Our Asset Servicing, Issuer Services, Clearing Services and Treasury Services businesses compete with domestic and foreign banks that offer institutional trust, custody products and cash management products, as well as a wide range of technologically capable service providers, such as data processing and shareholder service firms and other firms that rely on automated data transfer services for institutional and retail customers.
Many of our competitors, with the particular exception of bank and financial holding companies, banks and trust companies, are not subject to regulation as extensive as that described under the Supervision and Regulation section of this Form10-K and, as a result, may have a competitive advantage over us and our subsidiaries in certain respects.
12 BNY Mellon Table of Contents In recent years there has been substantial consolidation among companies in the financial services industry. Many broad-based financial services firms now have the ability to offer a wide range of products, from loans, deposit-taking and insurance to brokerage and asset management, which may enhance their competitive position. As a result of current conditions in the global financial markets and the economy in general, competition could continue to intensify and consolidation of financial service companies could continue to increase.
As part of our business strategy, we seek to distinguish ourselves from competitors by the level of service we deliver to our clients. We also believe that technological innovation is an important competitive factor, and, for this reason, have made and continue to make substantial investments in this area. The ability to recover quickly from unexpected events is a competitive factor, and we have devoted significant resources to being able to implement this. For additional discussion regarding competition, see Part I, Item1A of this Form 10-K, Risk Factors  Competition  We are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability below, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Employees At Dec. 31, 2010, BNY Mellon and its subsidiaries had approximately 48,000 employees.

Replacement Capital Covenant On Sept.19, 2006, Mellon Financial entered into a Replacement Capital Covenant (the RCC) in connection with the issuance by Mellon Financial of 200,050,000 aggregate principal amount of Mellon Financials 6.369% junior subordinated deferrable interest debt securities, due 2066 (the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities) to Mellon CapitalIII (the Trust) and the issuance by the Trust of 200,000,000 aggregate liquidation amount of the Trusts 6.369% trust preferred securities (the Preferred Securities). We refer to the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities and the Preferred Securities collectively as the Securities. Pursuant to the merger, BNY Mellon assumed Mellon Financials obligations under the RCC.
BNY Mellon agreed in the RCC for the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series of its long-term indebtedness for money borrowed, called Covered Debt in the RCC, that, on or before Sept.5, 2056:  BNY Mellon and its subsidiaries will not repay, redeem or repurchase any of the Securities, with limited exceptions, unless  BNY Mellon has obtained the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to do so if such approval is then required under the Federal Reserve Boards capital guidelines applicable to bank holding companies, and  the principal amount repaid or the applicable redemption or repurchase amount does not exceed specified percentages of the aggregate amount of net cash proceeds that BNY Mellon and its subsidiaries have received during the six months prior to delivery of notice of such repayment or redemption or the date of such repurchase from issuance of other securities specified in the RCC that, generally described, based on current standards are expected to receive equity credit at the time of sale or issuance equal to or greater than the equity credit attributed to the Securities at the time of such repayment, redemption or repurchase; and  BNY Mellon will not pay any interest that has been deferred on the Securities other than out of the net proceeds of common stock or certain non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock that is subject to a replacement capital covenant similar to the RCC, subject to certain limitations, and BNY Mellon will not redeem interest on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities that it has elected to capitalize, as permitted by the terms of such securities, except with the proceeds raised from the issuance or sale of common stock or rights to purchase common stock.
The series of long-term indebtedness for borrowed money that is Covered Debt under the RCC as of the date of this Form10-K is BNY Mellons 5.50% subordinated notes due Nov. 15, 2018, which have CUSIP No.585515AE9. Each series of long-term 14 BNY Mellon Table of Contents indebtedness for money borrowed that is Covered Debt, including BNY Mellons 5.50% subordinated notes due Nov.15, 2018, will cease to be Covered Debt on the earliest to occur of (i)the date that is two years prior to the final maturity date of such series, (ii)if BNY Mellon or a subsidiary elects to redeem or repurchase such series in whole or in part and after giving effect to such redemption or repurchase the outstanding principal amount of such series is less than $100,000,000, the applicable redemption or repurchase date, and (iii)if such series meets the other eligibility requirements set forth in the RCC for Covered Debt but is not subordinated debt, then the date (if any) on which BNY Mellon issues a series of long term indebtedness for money borrowed that meets the eligibility requirements of the RCC but is subordinated debt. The RCC includes provisions under which a new series of BNY Mellons long-term indebtedness for money borrowed will then be identified as and become the Covered Debt benefiting from the RCC.
The full text of the RCC is available as Exhibit99.1 to Mellon Financials current report on Form 8-K dated Sept.20, 2006. The description of the RCC set forth above is qualified by reference to its full text.
On June19, 2007, Mellon Financial entered into a Replacement Capital Covenant (the 2007 RCC) in connection with (i)the issuance by Mellon Capital IV (the 2007 Trust) of 500,000 of its 6.244% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Normal Preferred Capital Securities, or Normal PCS (together with Stripped PCS and Capital PCS issued pursuant to the terms of the Normal PCS, the PCS), having a stated amount of $1,000 per Normal PCS and $500,000,000 in the aggregate and (ii)the issuance by Mellon Financial to the 2007 Trust of $500,000,000 6.044% Junior Subordinated Notes, or Junior Notes, and a 1/100th interest in a Stock Purchase Contract under which the 2007 Trust is obligated to purchase, and Mellon Financial is obligated to sell, one share of Mellon Financials Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series L, $100,000 liquidation preference per share (the Preferred Stock). Pursuant to the merger, BNY Mellon assumed Mellon Financials obligation under the 2007 RCC.

ITEM1A. RISK FACTORS Making or continuing an investment in securities issued by us, including our common stock, involves certain risks that you should carefully consider. The following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, other factors, besides those discussed below or elsewhere in this Form 10-K or other of our reports filed with or furnished to the SEC, also could adversely affect our business or results. We cannot assure you that the risk factors described below or elsewhere in this document address all potential risks that we may face. These risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this Form 10-K. See Forward-looking Statements.
Uncertainties in global financial markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the domestic and global financial markets and the economy generally, both in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world. While there are indications that both the financial markets and the economy are recovering from the recent worldwide recession, a variety of factors raise concern over the course and strength of the recovery, including low interest rates, depressed home prices and increasing foreclosures, volatile equity market values, high unemployment, governmental budget deficits (including, in the U.S., at the federal, state and municipal level), contagion risk from possible default by other countries on sovereign debt, declining business and consumer confidence and the risk of increased inflation. These factors continue to have a significant effect on both the global economy and our business. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets may adversely affect certain portions of our business and our financial condition and results of operations. A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry. In particular, we may face the following risks in connection with these events:  The amount and range of our market risk exposures have been increasing over the past several years, and may continue to do so.
During periods of unfavorable market or economic conditions, the level of individual investor participation in the global markets, as well as the level of client assets, may also decrease, which would negatively impact the results of our Asset and Wealth Management businesses.
Fluctuations in global market activity could impact the flow of investment capital into or from assets under management and the way customers allocate capital among money market, equity, fixed income or other investment alternatives, which could negatively impact our Asset Management business.
Our ability to continue to operate certain commingled investment funds at a net asset value of $1.00 per unit and to allow unrestricted cash redemptions by investors in those commingled funds (or by investors in other funds managed by us which are invested in those commingled investment funds) may be adversely affected by depressed mark-to-market prices of the underlying portfolio securities held by such funds, or by material defaults on such securities or by the limited sources of liquidity that are available to such funds; and we may be faced with claims from investors and exposed to financial loss as a result of our operation of such funds.
Heightened regulation of our industry will increase our costs and may limit our ability to pursue business opportunities that we would otherwise pursue.
The process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure and to ascertain the fair value of securities held by us is subject to uncertainty in that it requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how these conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers and others to meet their obligations.
Our ability to access the public capital markets on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations.
16 BNY Mellon Table of Contents  The value of our investments in equity and debt securities, including our marketable debt securities and pension and other post-retirement plan assets, may decrease.
Concerns over market volatility continue.
The capital and credit markets experienced unprecedented volatility and disruption during the financial crisis. While markets stabilized in 2010, further upheaval could produce downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength. Under these extreme conditions, hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at mitigating trading losses as they would be under less volatile market conditions. Moreover, under these conditions market participants are particularly exposed to trading strategies employed by many market participants simultaneously and on a large scale, such as crowded trades. Severe market events have historically been difficult to predict, however, and we could realize significant losses if unprecedented extreme market events were to continue, such as the recent conditions in the global financial markets and global economy. For a discussion of risk, see Risk management in the MD&A  Results of Operations section in the Annual Report.
If markets experience further upheavals, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Reputational, Legal and Regulatory RiskOur business may be negatively affected by adverse publicity, regulatory actions or litigation with respect to us, other well-known companies and the financial services industry generally.
We are subject to reputational, legal and regulatory risk in the ordinary course of our business. These risks could include adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from events in the financial markets, our failure or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, the purported actions of our employees, alleged financial reporting irregularities involving ourselves or other large and well-known companies, increasing regulatory scrutiny of know your customer, anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist procedures and their effectiveness, and litigation that may arise from our failure or perceived failure to comply with policies and procedures. Any or all of these risks could result in increased regulatory supervision, affect our ability to attract and retain customers or maintain access to the capital markets, result in lawsuits, enforcement actions, damages, fines and penalties or have other adverse effects on us. Customers of our subsidiaries may make claims pertaining to the performance of fiduciary responsibilities, which may result in material financial liability and materially impair our reputation, if not resolved in a manner favorable to the subsidiary. Investigations by various federal and state regulatory agencies, the Department of Justice and state attorneys general, and any related litigation, could have an adverse effect on us. See Legal proceedings in Note25 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.
We are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision, including regulation and supervision in non-U.S. jurisdictions.
We operate in a highly regulated environment, and are subject to a comprehensive statutory regulatory regime as well as oversight by governmental agencies. In light of the current conditions in the global financial markets and economy, the Obama Administration, Congress and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. New or modified regulations and related regulatory guidance, including under Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act, may have unforeseen or unintended adverse effects on the financial services industry. The regulatory perspective, particularly that of the Federal Reserve Board, on regulatory capital requirements may affect our ability to make acquisitions, declare dividends or repurchase our common stock unless we can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of our regulators, that such actions would not adversely affect our regulatory capital position in the event of a severely stressed market environment. In addition, the implementation of certain of the regulations with regard to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect our regulatory capital position relative to that of our competitors. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur. Laws, regulations or policies, including accounting standards and BNY Mellon 17 Table of Contents interpretations, currently affecting us and our subsidiaries may change at any time. Regulatory authorities may also change their interpretation of these statutes and regulations. Therefore, our business may be adversely affected by future changes in laws, regulations, policies or interpretations or regulatory approaches to compliance and enforcement. See Supervision and Regulation in this Form 10-K. Some of the governmental authorities which may assert jurisdictional regulatory authority over us are located in and operate under jurisdictions outside the United States. Such jurisdictions may utilize legal principles and systems that differ materially from those encountered in the United States. Among other things, litigation in foreign jurisdictions may be decided much more quickly than in the U.S., trials may not involve testimony of witnesses who are in the courtroom and subject to cross-examination, and trials may be based solely on submission of written materials. These factors can make issues of regulatory compliance and legal proceedings more difficult to assess.
We may experience further write-downs of our financial instruments and other losses related to volatile and illiquid market conditions ; impairment of our instruments could harm our earnings.
We maintain an investment securities portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These securities are generally classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. Our portfolio includes non-agency U.S. and non-U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and credit cards, the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged. If such investments suffer credit losses, as we experienced with some of our investments in 2009, we may recognize in earnings the credit losses as an other-than-temporary impairment. For information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates, refer to the Risk managementMarket risk section in the MD&A  Results of Operations section in the Annual Report.
Recent legislative actions may have an adverse effect on the Companys operations.
In July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. This new law broadly affects the financial services industry, particularly those entities considered to be systemically important, such as bank holding companies with assets of over $50 billion, including BNY Mellon, by establishing a framework for systemic risk oversight, creating a liquidation authority, mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements, requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies and numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector.
U.S. regulatory agencies  banking, securities and commodities  have begun to publish notices of proposed regulations required by Dodd-Frank during the past several months, and new bodies created by Dodd-Frank (including the FSOC and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection) are commencing operations. The related findings of various regulatory and commission studies, the interpretations issued as part of the rulemaking process and the final regulations that are issued with respect to various elements of the new law may cause changes that impact the profitability of our business activities and require that we change certain of our business practices and plans, including those relating to cross-selling our products and services. These changes could also expose us to additional costs (including increased legal and compliance costs) and require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes.
Interest Rate EnvironmentOur revenues and profits are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
Our net interest revenue and cash flows are sensitive to interest rate changes and changes in valuations in the debt or equity markets over which we have no control. Our net interest revenue is the difference between the interest income earned on our interest-earning assets, such as the loans we make and the securities we hold in our investment portfolio, and the interest expense incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed money. We also earn net interest revenue on interest-free funds we hold.
The global market crisis has triggered a series of cuts in interest rates. During fiscal 2010, the Federal Open Market Committee kept the target federal funds rate between 0% and 0.25%. The low interest rate environment has compressed our net interest spread and reduced our spread-based revenues. It has also resulted in our voluntarily waiving fees on certain money market mutual funds and related distribution fees in order to prevent our clients yields on such funds from becoming negative. Changes in interest 18 BNY Mellon Table of Contents rates could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities. A rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread. Conversely, a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread. If we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk, changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Further volatility in interest rates could trigger one or more of the following additional effects:  changes in net interest revenue depending on our balance sheet position at the time of change. See discussion under Asset/liability management in the MD&A  Results of Operations section in the Annual Report;  an increased number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults and more nonperforming assets and net charge-offs as a result of abrupt increases in interest rates, including with respect to financial guaranty monoline insurers as to which we have credit exposure;  a decline in the value of our fixed-income investment portfolio as a result of increasing interest rates;  increased borrowing costs and reduced access to the capital markets caused by unfavorable financial conditions; and  decreased fee-based revenues due to a slowing of capital market activity or significant declines in market value.
A more detailed discussion of the interest rate and market risks we face is contained in the Risk management section in the MD&A  Results of Operations in the Annual Report.
Deposit insurance premiums may continue to increase.
During 2009 and 2010, due to a higher level of bank failures, the FDIC increased recurring deposit insurance premiums, imposed a special assessment on insured financial institutions, and required insured financial institutions to prepay three years of deposit premiums. Due to the continuing volume of bank failures, it is possible that a continued high level of funding will be required from insured financial institutions, such as BNY Mellon.
CompetitionWe are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.
Many businesses in which we operate are intensely competitive around the world. Other domestic and international banks and financial service companies such as trading firms, broker dealers, investment banks, specialized processing companies, outsourcing companies, data processing companies and asset managers aggressively compete with us for fee-based business. We also face competition from both unregulated and regulated financial services organizations such as mutual funds, insurance companies, credit unions, money market funds and investment counseling firms, whose products and services span the local, national and global markets in which we conduct operations. In addition, insurance companies, investment counseling firms, brokerage houses and other business firms and individuals offer active competition for personal trust services and investment counseling services.
Furthermore, pricing pressures, as a result of the ability of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price and customer pricing reviews, may result in a reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services which would likely negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.
Recently enacted and proposed legislation and regulation may impact our ability to conduct certain of our businesses in a cost-effective manner or at all, including legislation relating to restrictions on the type of activities in which financial institutions are permitted to engage. These or other similar proposals, which may not apply to all of our competitors, could adversely impact our ability to compete effectively. A decline in our competitive position could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.
Dependence on fee-based businessWe are dependent on fee-based business for a substantial majority of our revenue and our fee-based revenues could be adversely affected by a slowing in capital market activity, significant declines in market values or negative trends in savings rates or in individual investment preferences.
Our principal operational focus is on fee-based business, as distinct from commercial banking BNY Mellon 19 Table of Contents institutions that earn most of their revenues from loans and other traditional interest-generating products and services. We have redeployed our assets away from traditional retail banking to concentrate our resources further on fee-based businesses, including cash management, custody, mutual fund services, unit investment trusts, corporate trust, depositary receipts, stock transfer, securities execution and clearance, collateral management, and asset management.
Fees for many of our products and services are based on the volume of transactions processed, the market value of assets managed and administered, securities lending volume and spreads, and fees for other services rendered. Corporate actions, cross-border investing, global mergers and acquisitions activity, new debt and equity issuances, and secondary trading volumes all affect the level of our revenues.
Asset-based fees are typically determined on a sliding scale so that, as the value of a client portfolio grows, we receive a smaller percentage of the increasing value as fee income. This is particularly important to our asset management, global funds services and global custody businesses. Significant declines in the values of capital assets would reduce the market value of some of the assets that we manage and administer and result in a corresponding decrease in the amount of fees we receive and therefore would have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Similarly, significant declines in the volume of capital markets activity would reduce the number of transactions we process and the amount of securities lending we do and therefore would also have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
Our business generally benefits when individuals invest their savings in mutual funds and other collective funds, in defined benefit plans, unit investment trusts or exchange traded funds. If there is a decline in the savings rates of individuals, or if there is a change in investment preferences that leads to less investment in mutual funds, other collective funds and defined contribution plans, our revenues could be adversely affected.
Our fee-based revenues could be adversely affected by a stable exchange-rate environment or decreased cross-border investing activity.
The degree of volatility in foreign exchange rates can affect the amount of our foreign exchange trading revenue. Most of our foreign exchange revenue is derived from our securities servicing client base. Activity levels and spreads are generally higher when there is more volatility. Accordingly, we benefit from currency volatility and our foreign exchange revenue is likely to decrease during times of decreased currency volatility.
Our future revenue may increase or decrease depending upon the extent of increases or decreases in cross-border or other investments made by our clients. Economic and political uncertainties resulting from terrorist attacks, military actions or other events, including changes in laws or regulations governing cross-border transactions, such as currency controls, could result in decreased cross-border investment activity. Decreased cross-border investing could lead to decreased demand for investor services that we provide.
The trend towards use of electronic trade networks instead of traditional modes of exchange may result in unfavorable pressure on our foreign exchange business which could adversely impact our foreign exchange revenue.
Our ability to retain existing business and obtain new business is dependent on our consistent execution of the fee-based services we perform.
We provide custody, accounting, daily pricing and administration, master trust and master custody, investment management, trustee and recordkeeping, foreign exchange, securities lending, securities execution and clearance, correspondent clearing, stock transfer, cash management, trading and information services to clients worldwide. Assets under custody and assets under management are held by us in a custodial or fiduciary capacity and are not included in our assets. If we fail to perform these services in a manner consistent with our fiduciary, custodial and other obligations, existing and potential clients may lose confidence in our ability to properly perform these services and our business may be adversely affected. In addition, any such failure may result in contingent liabilities that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or losses that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
Our internal strategies and forecasts assume a growing client base and increasing client usage of our services. A decline in the pace at which we attract new clients and a decline of the pace at which existing and new clients use additional services and assign additional assets to us for management or custody would adversely affect our future results of operations. A decline in the rate at which our clients 20 BNY Mellon Table of Contents outsource functions, such as their internal accounts payable activities, would also adversely affect our results of operations.
Strategic acquisitions may pose integration risks.
From time to time, to achieve our strategic objectives, we have acquired or invested in other companies or businesses, and may do so in the future. Each of these poses integration challenges, including successfully retaining clients and key employees of both businesses and capitalizing on certain revenue synergies. We cannot assure you that we will realize, when anticipated or at all, the positive benefits expected as a result of our acquisitions or that any businesses acquired will be successfully integrated.
The soundness of financial institutions and other counterparties could adversely affect us.
Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have in the past led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions in the future. Many transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparties or clients. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
Any material reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets.
Our long-term debt is currently rated investment grade by the major rating agencies. These rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings of our long-term debt are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally.
In addition, rating agencies employ different models and formulas to assess the financial strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have, in their discretion, altered these models. Changes to the models, general economic conditions, or other circumstances outside our control could impact a rating agencys judgment of its rating and the rating it assigns us. In view of the difficulties experienced recently by many financial institutions, we believe that the rating agencies may heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions, may increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, may request additional information from the companies that they rate, and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels.
The outcome of such a review may have adverse ratings consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital. We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may be required to take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which may adversely affect us.
Capital AdequacyWe are subject to capital adequacy guidelines and, if we fail to meet these guidelines, our financial condition would be adversely affected.
Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements, BNY Mellon and our subsidiary banks and broker-dealers must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. As discussed under Supervision and Regulation  Capital Requirements in this Form 10-K, the capital requirements applicable to us as a bank holding company as well as to our subsidiary banks are in the process of being substantially revised, in connection with Basel III and the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. If our company, our subsidiary banks, or broker-dealers failed to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, their respective financial conditions would be materially and adversely affected. In light of recent market events, Dodd-Frank and Basel III, BNY Mellon and BNY Mellon 21 Table of Contents our subsidiary banks will be required to satisfy additional, more stringent, capital adequacy standards. We cannot fully predict the final form of, or the effects of, these regulations. Failure by BNY Mellon or one of our U.S. bank subsidiaries to maintain its status as well-capitalized and well managed, if unremedied over a period of time, would cause us to lose our status as a FHC and could affect the confidence of clients in us, thus also compromising our competitive position. See Supervision and Regulation in this Form 10-K and the Liquidity and dividends and Capital  Capital adequacy sections in the MD&A  Results of Operations section and the Recent Accounting and Regulatory Developments section in the MD&A section in the Annual Report.
Access to Capital MarketsIf our ability to access the capital markets is diminished, our business may be adversely affected.
Our business is dependent in part on our ability to access successfully the capital markets on a regular basis. We rely on access to both short-term money markets and long-term capital markets as significant sources of liquidity to the extent liquidity requirements are not satisfied by the cash flow from our consolidated operations. Events or circumstances, such as rising interest rates, market disruptions or loss of confidence of debt purchasers or counterparties in us or in the funds markets, could limit our access to capital markets, increase our cost of borrowing, adversely affect our liquidity, or impair our ability to execute our business plan. In addition, our ability to raise funding could be impaired if lenders develop a negative perception of our long-term or short-term financial prospects. Such negative perceptions could be developed if we incur large trading losses, we are downgraded or put on (or remain on) negative watch by the rating agencies, we suffer a decline in the level of our business activity, regulatory authorities take significant action against us, or we discover significant employee misconduct or illegal activity, among other reasons. If we are unable to raise funding using the methods described above, we would likely need to finance or liquidate unencumbered assets, such as our investment and trading portfolios, to meet maturing liabilities. We may be unable to sell some of our assets, or we may have to sell assets at a discount from market value, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations.
Monetary and Other Governmental PoliciesOur business is influenced by monetary and other governmental policies.
The monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. Due to current market conditions, we anticipate that monetary, tax and other government policies will become more rigorous. Heightened regulatory scrutiny and increased sanctions, changes or potential changes in domestic and international legislation and regulation as well as domestic or international regulatory investigations impose compliance, legal, review and response costs that may impact our profitability and may allow additional competition, facilitate consolidation of competitors, or attract new competitors into our businesses. The cost of geographically diversifying and maintaining our facilities to comply with regulatory mandates necessarily results in additional costs. Various legislative initiatives are from time to time introduced in Congress or relevant state legislatures. We cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such potential legislation, if enacted, would have upon our financial condition or operations. See Supervision and Regulation in this Form 10-K.
Operational RiskWe are exposed to operational risk as a result of providing certain services, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
We are exposed to operational risk as a result of providing various fee-based services including certain securities servicing, global payment services, private banking and asset management services. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from errors related to transaction processing, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, fraud by employees or persons outside the company, business interruption due to system failures or other events, or other risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events, including legal risk. We regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our business and provide for disaster and business recovery planning, including geographical diversification of our facilities; however, the occurrence of various events, including unforeseeable and unpreventable events such as hurricanes or other natural disasters, could still damage our physical facilities or our computer systems or software, cause delay or disruptions to operational functions, impair our clients, vendors and counterparties and negatively 22 BNY Mellon Table of Contents impact our results of operations. Operational risk also includes potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise as a result of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulatory requirements which could have an adverse effect on our reputation. For a discussion of risk see Risk management in the MD&A  Results of Operations section in the Annual Report.
Our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.
Management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements, we could be required to implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports.
Our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.
We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies, procedures and technical safeguards designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For a discussion of risk, see Risk management in the MD&A  Results of Operations section in the Annual Report.
TechnologyWe depend on our technology and intellectual property; if third parties misappropriate our intellectual property, our business may be adversely affected.
We are dependent on technology because many of our products and services involve processing large volumes of data. Our technology platforms must therefore provide global capabilities and scale. Rapid technological changes require significant and ongoing investments in technology to develop competitive new products and services or adopt new technologies. Technological advances which result in lower transaction costs may adversely impact our revenues. In addition, unsuccessful implementation of technological upgrades and new products may adversely impact our ability to service and retain customers.
Developments in the securities processing industry, including shortened settlement cycles and straight-through-processing, will necessitate ongoing changes to our business and operations and will likely require additional investment in technology. Our financial performance depends in part on our ability to develop and market new and innovative services, to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate our products or provide cost efficiencies and to deliver these products and services to the market in a timely manner at a competitive price.
Rapid technological change in the financial services industry, together with competitive pressures, require us to make significant and ongoing investments. We cannot provide any assurance that our technology spending will achieve gains in competitiveness or profitability, and the costs we incur in product development could be substantial. Accordingly, we could incur substantial development costs without achieving corresponding gains in profitability.
Furthermore, if a third party were to assert a claim of infringement or misappropriation of its proprietary rights, obtained through patents or otherwise, against us with respect to one or more of our methods of doing business or conducting our operations, we could be required to spend significant amounts to defend such claims, develop alternative methods of operations, pay substantial money damages or obtain a license from the third party.
BNY Mellon 23 Table of Contents Global OperationsWe are subject to political, economic, legal, operational and other risks that are inherent in operating globally.
In conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our global operations, we are subject to risks of loss from the outbreak of hostilities or acts of terrorism and various unfavorable political, economic, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, and changes in laws and regulations. Further, our businesses and operations are increasingly expanding into new regions throughout the world, including emerging markets. Various emerging market countries have experienced severe economic and financial disruptions, including significant devaluations of their currencies, defaults or threatened defaults on sovereign debt, capital and currency exchange controls, and low or negative growth rates in their economies, as well as military activity or acts of terrorism. The possible effects of any of these conditions may adversely affect our business and increase volatility in global financial markets generally.
Acts of TerrorismActs of terrorism and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business.
Acts of terrorism and global conflicts could have a significant impact on our business and operations. While we have in place business continuity and disaster recovery plans, acts of terrorism could still damage our facilities and disrupt or delay normal operations, and have a similar impact on our clients, suppliers, and counterparties. Acts of terrorism and global conflicts could also negatively impact the purchase of our products and services to the extent they resulted in reduced capital markets activity, lower asset price levels, or disruptions in general economic activity in the United States or abroad, or in financial market settlement functions. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, terror attacks, political unrest, global conflicts, the national and global efforts to combat terrorism and other potential military activities and outbreaks of hostilities have affected and may further adversely affect economic growth, and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to predict.
New lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.
From time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible.
We may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.
Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our existing employees, and continue to compensate employees competitively amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensation practices of large financial institutions. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them. Our ability to attract and retain key executives and/or other key employees may be hindered as a result of executive compensation limits and requirements set forth in regulations that may be issued under recently proposed and enacted legislation.
Tax Laws and RegulationsTax law changes or challenges to our tax positions with respect to historical transactions may adversely affect our net income, effective tax rate and our overall results of operations and financial condition.
In the course of our business, we receive inquiries from both U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities on the amount of taxes we owe, such as those matters discussed in Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. If we are not successful in defending these inquiries, we may be required to adjust the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions, all of which can require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise negatively affect earnings. Probabilities and outcomes are reviewed as events unfold, and adjustments to the reserves are made when necessary, but the reserves may prove inadequate because we cannot necessarily accurately predict the outcome of any challenge, settlement or litigation or to what extent it will 24 BNY Mellon Table of Contents negatively affect us or our business. In addition, changes in tax legislation or the interpretation of existing tax laws worldwide could have a material impact on our net income.
Accounting PrinciplesChanges in accounting standards could have a material impact on our financial statements.
From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the International Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and bank regulators change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements such as the potential adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements. See Recent Accounting and Regulatory Developments in the MD&A section in the Annual Report. These changes are difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations and other financial data, although, in certain instances, these changes may not have an economic impact on our business.
Credit ReservesWe could incur income statement charges if our reserves for credit losses, including loan reserves, are inadequate.
We have credit exposure to residential mortgages, the financial, airline and automotive industries, monoline financial guaranty insurers and many other industries. We cannot provide any assurance as to whether charge-offs related to these sectors or to different credit risks may occur in the future. Though credit risk is inherent in lending activities, our revenues and profitability are adversely affected when our borrowers default in whole or in part on their loan obligations to us. We rely on our business experience to estimate future defaults, which we use to create loan loss reserves against our loan portfolio. In addition, current market developments may increase default and delinquency rates, which may impact our charge-offs. We cannot provide any assurance that these reserves, based on management estimates, will not be required to be augmented due to an unexpectedly high level of defaults. If reserves for credit losses are not sufficient, we would be required to record a larger credit loss reserve against current earnings.
Holding CompanyWe are a holding company, and as a result, are dependent on dividends from our subsidiaries, including our subsidiary banks, to meet our obligations, including our obligations with respect to our debt securities, and to provide funds for payment of dividends to our shareholders.
We are a non-operating holding company, whose principal assets and sources of income are our principal bank subsidiaries  The Bank of New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A.  and our other subsidiaries. We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banks and other subsidiaries and, therefore, we rely primarily on dividends and interest from these banking and other subsidiaries to meet our obligations, including our obligations with respect to our debt securities, and to provide funds for payment of dividends to our shareholders, to the extent declared by our board of directors. There are various legal limitations on the extent to which these banking and other subsidiaries can finance or otherwise supply funds to us (by dividend or otherwise) and certain of our affiliates.
For example, as a result of charges related to the restructuring of our securities portfolio in the third quarter of 2009, The Bank of New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A. currently require regulatory consent prior to paying a dividend to us.
Although we maintain cash positions for liquidity at the holding company level, if these banking subsidiaries or other of our subsidiaries were unable to supply us with cash over time, we could be unable to meet our obligations, including our obligations with respect to our debt securities, or declare or pay dividends in respect of our capital stock. See Supervision and Regulation  Dividend Restrictions in this Form 10-K, the Liquidity and Dividends section in the MD&A  Results of Operations section and Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.
Because we are a holding company, our rights and the rights of our creditors, including the holders of our debt securities, to a share of the assets of any subsidiary upon the liquidation or recapitalization of the subsidiary will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors (including, in the case of our banking subsidiaries, their depositors), except to the extent that we may ourselves be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary. The rights of holders of our debt securities to benefit from those distributions will also be junior to those prior claims. Consequently, our debt securities will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of BNY Mellon 25 Table of Contents our subsidiaries. A holder of our debt securities should look only to our assets for payments in respect of those debt securities.
Limits on common stock dividends.
Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so. Any increase in BNY Mellons ongoing quarterly dividend would require consultation with the Federal Reserve Board. Any reduction of, or the elimination of, our common stock dividend in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
Anti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our stockholders.
Provisions of Delaware law and provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us.Additionally, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue additional series of preferred stock and such preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal.These provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders.
