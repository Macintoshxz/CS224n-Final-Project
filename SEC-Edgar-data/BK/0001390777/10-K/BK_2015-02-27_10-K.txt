We were formed as a bank holding company (BHC) and have our executive offices in New York, New York. With its subsidiaries, BNY Mellon has been in business since 1784.
On July1, 2007, The Bank of New York Company, Inc. and Mellon Financial Corporation (Mellon Financial) merged into BNY Mellon, with BNY Mellon being the surviving entity (the merger).
Our two principal banks are:  The Bank of New York Mellon, a New York state chartered bank, which houses our Investment Services businesses, including Asset Servicing, Issuer Services, Treasury Services, Broker-Dealer and Advisor Services as well as the bank-advised business of Asset Management.
BNY Mellon, National Association (BNY Mellon, N.A.), a nationally-chartered bank, which houses our Wealth Management business.
Our two principal U.S. banks engage in trust and custody activities, investment management services, banking services and various securities-related activities.
We have four other U.S. bank and/or trust companies concentrating on trust products and services across the United States: The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association, BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing Trust Company and BNY Mellon Trust Company of Illinois. Most of our asset management businesses, along with our Pershing businesses, are direct or indirect non-bank subsidiaries of BNY Mellon.
Each of our bank and trust companies are subject to regulation by the applicable banking regulatory authority. The deposits of our U.S. banking subsidiaries are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent provided by law.
BNY Mellons branches and subsidiaries outside the United States are subject to regulation by non-U.S. regulatory authorities in addition to the Federal Reserve. The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV (BNYMSA) is the main banking subsidiary of The Bank of New York Mellon in continental Europe.It is authorized and regulated as a credit institution by the National Bank of Belgium. BNYMSA has its principal office in Brussels and branches in Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Frankfurt, Germany; London, England; the City of Luxembourg, Luxembourg and Paris, France.BNYMSAs activities are in the Investment Services segment of BNY Mellon with a focus on global custody, asset servicing and collateral management. For additional discussion, see the MD&A  Supervision and Regulation section in the Annual Report.
Information on international operations is presented in the Net interest revenue, Income tax, Review of businesses, International operations, Consolidated balance sheet review sections in the MD&A section in the Annual Report, Notes 5, 6 and 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 4 BNY Mellon Table of Contents Statements in the Annual Report and in Risk Factors  We are subject to political, economic, legal, operational and other risks that are inherent in operating globally and which may adversely affect our business, in the Annual Report, which portions are incorporated herein by reference.
Primary Subsidiaries Exhibit 21.1 to this Form 10-K presents a list of BNY Mellons primary subsidiaries as of Dec. 31, 2012.
Discontinued Operations As discussed in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference, BNY Mellon reported results using the discontinued operations method of accounting for 2010. All information in this Form 10-K for 2010, including all supplemental information, reflects continuing operations unless otherwise noted.
Supervision and Regulation Information on BNY Mellons supervision and regulation obligations can be found in the MD&A  Supervision and Regulation section in the Annual Report. That information is incorporated into this item by reference.
Competition BNY Mellon is subject to intense competition in all aspects and areas of our business. Our Investment Management business competes with asset management firms, hedge funds, investment banking companies and other financial services companies, including trust banks, brokerage firms, and insurance companies. We may compete with these firms and companies domestically or internationally. Our Investment Services business competes with domestic and foreign financial services firms that offer custody services, corporate trust services, clearing services, collateral services, credit services, securities brokerage, foreign exchange services, derivatives services, depositary receipt services, transfer agent services and cash management services and related products, as well as a wide range of technology service providers, such as financial service data processing firms. Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service, quality and range of products and services offered, price, reputation, interest rates, lending limits and customer convenience.
Many of our competitors, with the particular exception of bank and financial holding companies, banks and trust companies, are not subject to regulation as extensive as that described under the MD&A  Supervision and Regulation section in the Annual Report and, as a result, may have a competitive advantage over us and our subsidiaries in certain respects.
In recent years there has been substantial consolidation among companies in the financial services industry. Many broad-based financial services firms now have the ability to offer a wide range of products, from loans, deposit-taking and insurance to brokerage and asset management, which may enhance their competitive position.
As part of our business strategy, we seek to distinguish ourselves from competitors by the level of service we deliver to our clients. We also believe that technological innovation is an important competitive factor, and, for this reason, have made and continue to make substantial investments in this area. The ability to recover quickly from unexpected events is a competitive factor, and we have devoted significant resources to being able to implement this. For additional discussion regarding competition, see MD&A  Risk Factors  We are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability in the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Employees At Dec. 31, 2012, BNY Mellon and its subsidiaries had approximately 49,500 employees.

ITEM9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable.
ITEM9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with participation by the members of the Disclosure Committee, has responsibility for ensuring that there is an adequate and effective process for establishing, maintaining, and evaluating disclosure controls and 10 BNY Mellon Table of Contents procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our SEC reports is timely recorded, processed, summarized and reported and that information required to be disclosed by BNY Mellon is accumulated and communicated to BNY Mellons management to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure. In addition, our ethics hotline can also be used by employees and others for the anonymous communication of concerns about financial controls or reporting matters. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.
As of Dec. 31, 2012, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, except for our processes and procedures for reporting Assets under Custody and/or Administration (AUC/A), discussed below.
In light of the errors discussed in our Annual Report, the evaluation included a review of processes and procedures for reporting AUC/A. See General  Reporting of Assets under Custody and/or Administration in the MD&A section of our Annual Report. We have determined that our disclosure controls and procedures over the preparation of these metrics were ineffective as of Dec.31, 2012. Subsequent to Dec.31, 2012, we have remediated our disclosure controls and procedures over the preparation of these metrics. The errors relating to AUC/A are unrelated to our internal control over financial reporting.
As a result of these errors, we are seeking to streamline and enhance the data collection processes and systems relating to AUC/A. We also have commenced a review of the process for reporting other information in our public filings and have begun and will continue to correct and enhance our disclosure policies and procedures going forward.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting In the ordinary course of business, we may routinely modify, upgrade or enhance our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. There have not been any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
