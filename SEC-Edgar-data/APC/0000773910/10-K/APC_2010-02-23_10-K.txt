Business and Properties GENERAL Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is among the largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies in the world, with 2.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) of proved reserves as of December31, 2009. Anadarkos primary business segments are managed separately due to the nature of the products and services, as well as to the unique technology, distribution and marketing requirements. The Companys three operating segments are: Oil and gas exploration and production  This segment explores for and produces natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs). The Companys operations are located onshore United States and in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, as well as in Algeria, Brazil, China, Cote dIvoire, Ghana, Indonesia, Mozambique, Sierra Leone and other countries.
Midstream  This segment provides gathering, processing, treating and transportation services to Anadarko and third-party oil and gas producers. The Company owns and operates natural-gas gathering, processing, treating and transportation systems in the United States.
Marketing  This segment sells much of Anadarkos production, as well as hydrocarbons purchased from third parties. The Company actively markets oil, natural gas and NGLs in the United States, and actively markets oil from Algeria and China.
The Company owns interests in several coal, trona (natural soda ash) and industrial mineral properties through non-operated joint ventures and royalty arrangements within and adjacent to its land grant acreage position (Land Grant). The Land Grant consists of land granted by the federal government in the mid-1800s, which passes through Colorado and Wyoming and into Utah. Within the Land Grant, the Company has fee ownership of the mineral rights under approximately 8million acres.
Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms Anadarko or Company refer to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Companys corporate headquarters is located at 1201 Lake Robbins Drive, The Woodlands, Texas 77380-1046, and its telephone number is (832)636-1000. Additionally, unless noted otherwise, the following information relates to Anadarkos continuing operations and excludes the discontinued Canadian operations.

2 Table of Contents OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES AND ACTIVITIES The map below illustrates the locations of Anadarkos domestic and international oil and gas exploration and production operations. The Company plans to allocate approximately 90% of its 2010 capital budget to the oil and gas exploration and production segment.
Properties and ActivitiesUnited States Overview Anadarkos active areas in the United States include onshore in the Lower 48 states and Alaska, and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Proved reserves in the United States comprised 89% of Anadarkos total proved reserves at year-end 2009. During 2009, the Companys drilling efforts in the United States resulted in 979 natural-gas wells, 40 oil wells and 21 dry holes. The Company plans to allocate approximately 65% of its 2010 oil and gas exploration and production segment capital budget to properties in the United States.

Rocky Mountain Region Anadarkos Rocky Mountain Region (Rockies) properties are located in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming with a primary focus on natural-gas plays. Anadarko operates approximately 13,000 wells and has an interest in approximately 9,400 non-operated wells in the Rockies. Anadarko is an operator of tight gas and coalbed methane (CBM) natural-gas assets, as well as enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects within the region. Tight gas is found in low-permeability reservoirs containing natural gas. The Company also earns royalty revenues from many operated and non-operated wells located within its Land Grant acreage. Activities in the Rockies focus on expanding the potential of mature fields to increase production and add proved reserves through infill drilling operations, re-completions and re-fracture stimulations of pre-existing wells. In 2009, the Company drilled 724 wells in the Rockies and plans to maintain an active drilling program in the region in 2010.
The Companys operated tight gas assets are located in the Greater Natural Buttes, Wattenberg, Wamsutter and Moxa fields. Pinedale is a non-operated asset within Anadarkos tight gas portfolio. Anadarko uses fracture-stimulation technology to create an enhanced migration pathway for the natural gas to flow to the wellhead. Anadarko operates 7,000 wells and has an interest in 4,000 non-operated wells in these tight gas areas. The Company also benefits from third-party-operator success in the Wyoming portion of its Land Grant acreage and actively pursues farm-out projects to capture incremental royalty revenues from exploration and development activity in the area. In 2010, Anadarko plans to maintain an active drilling program in these tight gas areas.
Anadarko also operates multiple CBM properties in the Rockies. CBM is natural gas that is stored in coal seams. To produce it, water is extracted from the coal seam, which reduces pressure and releases natural gas which then flows to the wellhead. Anadarkos primary CBM properties are located in the Powder River Basin and Atlantic Rim areas in Wyoming and the Helper, Clawson and Cardinal Draw areas in Utah. Anadarko operates approximately 4,600 shallow, low-cost CBM wells and has an interest in approximately 5,200 outside-operated CBM wells in the Rockies. In 2010, Anadarko will continue its active CBM development program primarily in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming.
The Companys EOR operations increase the amount of oil that can be produced from mature reservoirs after primary recovery methods have been completed. During 2009, the Company continued to pursue phased development of its Rockies EOR assets at the Salt Creek and Monell areas in Wyoming. Each area has experienced year-over-year increases in production due to CO 2 injection operations. The Company expects the phased development to continue throughout 2010 for these assets.
Southern Region Anadarkos Southern Region properties are primarily natural-gas plays located in Texas, Pennsylvania and Kansas. Operations in these areas are focused on finding and producing natural-gas resources from tight sands, naturally fractured carbonates and emerging shale plays.
Anadarko is active in the Bossier, Haley, Carthage, Chalk, South Texas and Ozona areas of Texas, where the Company employs vertical and horizontal drilling programs. In 2009, the Company drilled 166 development wells in these areas. Early in 2009, Anadarko reduced its activity in the Bossier and Carthage areas due to a then-existing misalignment between high service costs and low commodity prices. During the course of 2009, drilling efficiency improved in every actively developed field in these areas with almost 30% of all wells drilled setting field records for cycle time. These efficiency gains, combined with lower service costs during the second half of 2009, resulted in a significant improvement in capital efficiency. As a result, increased activity is expected in Carthage in 2010. Although the Hugoton area in Southern Kansas has historically been a long-life, slow-decline asset for Anadarko, the Company expects an increased activity level in the area in 2010 due to recent changes in local regulations controlling the number of wells that may be drilled in a given area.
Anadarkos 2009 onshore exploration program focused primarily on testing and developing emerging shale plays. Anadarko conducted successful exploratory tests in Pennsylvanias Marcellus shale play as well as in Texas Eagleford, Pearsall and Haynesville shale plays. In the Appalachian basin, where the Marcellus shale is being developed, 11 operated horizontal wells were spud and six of the wells were completed in 2009. As a non-operating partner, Anadarko also participated in 40 new horizontal wells and 12 wells were completed in 2009. As of December31, 2009, Anadarko held interests in approximately 716,000 gross acres (approximately 350,000 net acres) in the Marcellus shale play and operated about half of the acreage with an average working 4 Table of Contents interest of approximately 50%. In February 2010, the Company announced a joint-venture agreement which permits a third party to participate with the Company as a 32.5% partner in the Companys Marcellus Shale assets, primarily located in north-central Pennsylvania, for approximately $1.4 billion. The third party will earn an interest in approximately 100,000 net acres in exchange for funding 100% of the Companys share of 2010 development costs, and 90% of these costs thereafter, with an estimated funding-completion date of 2013. The third party will also have the opportunity to purchase a 32.5% share of the Companys existing wells and additional acreage acquisitions by reimbursing a proportionate share of the Companys prior expenditures. Closing of this transaction is subject to applicable regulatory approvals and other contractual conditions.
In the Maverick basin, where the Eagleford and Pearsall shale plays are being developed, 15 wells were spud and 10 wells were completed in 2009. As of December31, 2009, Anadarko held approximately 380,000 gross acres (approximately 180,000 net acres) with an average working interest of approximately 50% in this area. Anadarko is also focusing on the Haynesville shale play in Texas where it currently has eight producing wells. Anadarko drilled six wells and completed five wells in 2009 and is transitioning to a development program. The Company plans to increase its activity in each of these areas in 2010.
Alaska Anadarkos activity in Alaska is concentrated primarily on the North Slope. Development activity continued at the Colville River Unit through 2009 with seven wells drilled. In 2010, the Company anticipates sanctioning of the Alpine West satellite project and participating in approximately 10 development wells.
Gulf of Mexico In the Gulf of Mexico, Anadarko owns an average 66% working interest in 575 blocks and has access to an additional six blocks through participation agreements. The Company operates eight floating platforms, holds interests in 26 producing fields and is in the process of delineating and developing seven additional fields in the area. Anadarko plans to allocate approximately 20% of its 2010 oil and gas exploration and production segment capital budget to the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
In 2009, Anadarko drilled seven development wells in the Gulf of Mexico. The Company plans to drill nine development wells in the area in 2010. Anadarko utilizes a hub-and-spoke infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico in order to develop resources more quickly and at a substantial cost savings. In September 2008, Hurricane Ike damaged third-party-owned export pipelines downstream of the Marco Polo complex and the Constitution/Ticonderoga fields, thereby limiting production from certain Anadarko fields. Production from these fields returned to full capacity in the third quarter of 2009 as repairs to the third-party-owned infrastructure were completed.
In 2009, Anadarko is continuing to make progress on the Caesar Tonga development project, which is on schedule for first production in early 2011. The field is a sub-sea tieback to the Anadarko-operated and owned Constitution spar. This project is being accelerated by two years through a hub-and-spoke strategy utilizing the existing spar. In 2009, topside construction, modification and installation began on the Constitution spar. Construction, installation, drilling and completion activities will continue to advance the project in 2010.
Anadarkos Gulf of Mexico exploration program is currently focused in the deepwaters of the extensive middle-to-lower Miocene play in the central Gulf of Mexico and the developing lower-Tertiary play in the western Gulf of Mexico. During 2009, Anadarko participated in five successful deepwater wells (Heidelberg, Shenandoah, Samurai, Vito and Lucius) and two delineation wells, at Lucius and Vito, which were still drilling at the end of 2009. Anadarko also drilled four unsuccessful wells in the Gulf of Mexico in 2009. The Company expects to participate in approximately two to four exploration wells and several delineation wells in the area in 2010.
Properties and ActivitiesInternational Overview The Companys international oil and gas production and development operations are located primarily in Algeria, China and Ghana. The Company also has exploration acreage in Brazil, Cote dIvoire, Ghana, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Mozambique, Indonesia and other countries. Approximately 11% of the Companys proved reserves were located in these international locations at year-end 2009. Anadarko drilled 44 wells in international areas in 2009. In 2010, the Company expects to drill approximately 24 development and 20 exploration wells at various international locations. Anadarko plans to allocate approximately 35% of its 2010 oil and gas exploration and production segment capital budget to international areas.
5 Table of Contents Algeria Anadarko is engaged in development and production activities in Algerias Sahara Desert in Blocks 404 and 208. Currently, all production is from fields in Block 404, which produce through the Hassi Berkine South and Ourhoud Central Production Facilities (CPF). Anadarko reached a major milestone during the year with the awarding of all major contracts for the construction of the CPF and associated infrastructure for the El Merk development project in Block 208. At December31, 2009, site preparation was well advanced, contractor personnel were being mobilized to the site and long-lead items had been ordered. Initial production is scheduled for late 2011. During 2009, six development wells were drilled in Blocks 404 and 208. During 2010, the Company expects to drill approximately 10 development wells in the two blocks, with a focus on El Merk drilling.
Contracts and Partners Since October 1989, the Companys operations in Algeria have been governed by a Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) between Anadarko, two third parties, and Sonatrach, the national oil and gas company of Algeria. Anadarkos interest in the PSA for Blocks 404 and 208 is 50% before participation at the exploitation stage by Sonatrach. The Company has two partners, each with a 25% interest, also prior to participation by Sonatrach. Under the terms of the PSA, oil reserves that are discovered, developed and produced are shared by Sonatrach, Anadarko and its two partners. Sonatrach is responsible for 51% of the development and production costs. Anadarko and its partners have completed the exploration program on Blocks 404 and 208 and now participate only in development activity on these blocks. Anadarko and its joint-venture partners funded Sonatrachs share of exploration costs and are entitled to recover these exploration costs from production during the development phase.
In March 2006, Anadarko received a letter from Sonatrach purporting to give notice under the PSA that enactment of a law in 2005 (2005 Law), relating to hydrocarbons, triggered Sonatrachs right under the PSA to renegotiate the PSA in order to re-establish the equilibrium of Anadarkos and Sonatrachs interests. Anadarko and Sonatrach reached an impasse over whether Sonatrach had a right to renegotiate the PSA based on the 2005 Law and entered into a formal non-binding conciliation process under the terms of the PSA in an attempt to resolve this dispute. The conciliation on the 2005 Law dispute was concluded in 2007 without a definitive resolution. There have been no further developments on the 2005 Law dispute. At this time, Anadarko is unable to reasonably estimate the economic impact under the PSA if Sonatrach were to succeed in modifying the PSA.
Exceptional Profits Tax In July 2006, the Algerian parliament approved legislation establishing an exceptional profits tax on foreign companies Algerian oil production and issued regulations implementing this legislation. These regulations provide for an exceptional profits tax imposed on gross production at rates of taxation ranging from 5% to 50% based on average daily production volumes for each calendar month in which the price of Brent crude averages over $30 per barrel. Based on the Application Procedure issued in April 2007 by ALNAFT, an agency under the control of the Algerian Ministry of Energy and Mines, the exceptional profits tax is applied to the full value of production and not just to the amount in excess of $30 per barrel.
In January 2007, Sonatrach advised Anadarko that it would begin collecting the exceptional profits tax from Anadarkos share of production commencing with March 2007 liftings, including for the prior months since the new tax went into effect. In response to the Algerian governments imposition of the exceptional profits tax, the Company notified Sonatrach of its disagreement with the collection of the exceptional profits tax. The Company believes that the PSA provides fiscal stability through several of its provisions that require Sonatrach to pay all taxes and royalties. To facilitate discussions between the parties in an effort to resolve the dispute, on October31, 2007, the Company initiated a conciliation proceeding on the exceptional profits tax as provided in the PSA. Any recommendation issued by a conciliation board (Conciliation Board) arising out of the conciliation proceeding is non-binding on the parties. The Conciliation Board issued its non-binding recommendation on November26, 2008, which the Company received on December1, 2008. On February15, 2009, the Company initiated arbitration against Sonatrach with regard to the exceptional profits tax. In conformance with the terms of the PSA, a notice of arbitration was submitted to Sonatrach. For additional information, see Note 15Other Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
China Anadarkos development and production activities in China are located offshore in Bohai Bay. Development drilling and recompletion activity was ongoing throughout 2009, and Anadarko drilled 14 wells 6 Table of Contents during the year. Development continued during 2009 with the approval of a facility expansion and an infill drilling program implemented in order to sustain current-level production. Development drilling activity in 2010 is expected to be similar to 2009 levels. Anadarko drilled one unsuccessful exploration well in Bohai Bay in 2009. During 2010, the Company plans to drill one deepwater exploration well in the South China Sea.
Ghana Anadarkos exploration and development activities in Ghana are located offshore in the West Cape Three Points block and the Deepwater Tano block. A significant milestone was achieved in 2009 with the Ghanaian government formally approving the Jubilee field Phase I Plan of Development and Unitization Agreement. During 2009, the Company and its partners drilled six development wells in the field and awarded all contracts. Approximately 84% of the construction work on a floating production, storage and offloading vessel had been completed by a third-party shipbuilder at December31, 2009. Anadarko expects initial production from the Jubilee field in late 2010. During 2009, the Company also participated in four successful exploration and appraisal wells. The Tweneboa discovery was announced in early 2009 and an appraisal well was drilling at December31, 2009. In 2010, the Company plans to participate in five to seven exploration and appraisal wells in the two blocks.
Brazil Anadarko holds exploration interests in seven blocks located offshore Brazil in the Campos and Esprito Santo basins. In these areas, Anadarko drilled three exploration wells and one appraisal well in 2009, including three successful wells at Coalho, Itaipu and Wahoo North. In 2010, Anadarko expects to participate in three to four deepwater exploration and appraisal wells.
Indonesia Anadarko has participating interests in approximately 4.5million exploration acres in Indonesia through a combination of several operated and non-operated Production Sharing Contracts. The Company participated in two unsuccessful exploration wells in 2009 and plans to participate in two to four exploration wells in 2010.
Mozambique The Company has participating interests in two blocks (one onshore and one offshore) totaling approximately 6.4million acres. During 2009, Anadarko participated in one offshore exploration well that was drilling at December31, 2009. Anadarko also drilled one unsuccessful onshore exploration well in 2009. In 2010, the Company plans to drill two to four deepwater exploration wells in this area.
Sierra Leone Anadarkos exploration activities in Sierra Leone are located in blocks 6 and 7 in the Liberian basin. In 2009, Anadarko announced a deepwater discovery at the Venus prospect, which confirmed the presence of an active petroleum system in this frontier basin. In 2010, the Company plans to drill one to three exploration and appraisal wells in the Liberian basin.
Cote dIvoire Anadarko holds interests in two blocks located in the Ivorian basin. The Company participated in one unsuccessful well offshore Cote dIvoire in 2009. In 2010, Anadarko expects to drill one to two exploration wells in the area.
Other Anadarko also has active exploration projects in Liberia and Kenya as well as activities in other potential exploration and new venture areas overseas.
Proved Reserves In December 2008, the SEC released the final rule for Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting. The new rule requires disclosure of oil and gas proved reserves by significant geographic area, using the 12-month average beginning-of-month price for the year, rather than year-end prices, and allows the use of reliable technologies to estimate proved oil and gas reserves, if those technologies have been demonstrated to result in reliable conclusions about reserves volumes. In addition, companies are required to report on the independence and qualifications of its reserves preparer or auditor, and file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates or conduct a reserves audit.
7 Table of Contents Reserve and related information for 2009 is presented consistent with the requirements of the new rule. The new rule does not allow prior-year reserve information to be restated, so all information related to periods prior to 2009 is presented consistent with prior SEC rules for the estimation of proved reserves. Prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation of significant geographic areas.
Estimates of volumes of proved reserves, net of royalty interests, of natural gas, oil, condensate and NGLs owned at year end are presented in billions of cubic feet (Bcf) at a pressure base of 14.73 pounds per square inch for natural gas and in millions of barrels (MMBbls) for oil, condensate and NGLs. Total volumes are presented in millions of barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE). For this computation, one barrel is the equivalent of 6,000 cubic feet of gas. NGLs are included with oil and condensate reserves and any associated shrinkage has been deducted from the gas reserves.
Summary of Oil and Gas Reserves as of December31, 2009 NaturalGas (Bcf) Oil,Condensate, NGLs (MMBbls) Total (MMBOE) Proved Developed United States 5,884 499 1,480 International  144 144 Undeveloped United States 1,880 261 574 International  106 106 Total proved 7,764 1,010 2,304 The Companys estimates of proved reserves, proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves (PUDs) at December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 and changes in proved reserves during the last three years are contained in the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities (Supplemental Information) in the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K. The Company files annual estimates of certain proved oil and gas reserves with the U.S. Department of Energy, which are within 5% of the amounts included in the above estimates.
Also contained in the Supplemental Information in the Consolidated Financial Statements are the Companys estimates of future net cash flows and discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves. See Operating Results and Critical Accounting Estimates under Item 7 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the Companys proved reserves.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves The Company annually reviews all PUDs to ensure an appropriate plan for development exists. Generally, onshore United States PUDs are converted to proved developed reserves within five years. Projects such as enhanced oil recovery, arctic development, deepwater development and international programs may take longer than five years. The Company had 1.9 Tcf and 367 MMBbls of PUDs, totaling 680 MMBOE at December31, 2009, compared to 677 MMBOE of PUDs at December31, 2008. In 2009, the Company converted 100 MMBOE, or 15% of the total year-end 2008 PUDs to proved developed reserves (PDP). Approximately $1.0 billion was spent in 2009 associated with development of PUDs. Of the total $1.0 billion spent in 2009, approximately 40% related to three of the Companys major development projectsEl Merk in Algeria, and K2 and Caesar Tonga in the Gulf of Mexico, and approximately 50% was spent on domestic infill drilling programs in the Rockies and Southern Region. The remainder of 2009 PUD spending was primarily associated with other Gulf of Mexico PUD conversions.
The Company has 136 MMBOE of PUDs, as of December31, 2009, which were reported prior to 2005. Approximately 54% of the Companys PUDs booked prior to 2005 are in Algeria and are being developed according to an Algerian government-approved plan. Nearly all of the Algerian PUDs are associated with the El 8 Table of Contents Merk development project located on Block 208 in the Berkine basin. Construction of the El Merk CPF is underway and development drilling continues with a targeted production-initiation date of late 2011. Another 20% of the pre-2005 PUDs are associated with various phases of the Salt Creek EOR phased-development program in the Rockies. Since 2003, APC has invested $20 to $145 million per year to develop six different Salt Creek phase areas. The remaining EOR pre-2005 PUD phase areas are scheduled for completion by 2015. Approximately 8% of the pre-2005 PUDs are associated with Gulf of Mexico sidetrack opportunities where platform well slots are currently not available. The Company expects to take advantage of these opportunities by 2015 as it currently awaits the depletion of an existing producing well. The Companys remaining PUDs booked prior to 2005 are associated with multiple domestic onshore fields and are also scheduled for conversion by 2015.
Evaluation and Review Anadarkos estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of December31, 2009 were made solely by the Companys engineers and are the responsibility of management. To ensure confidence in its estimates, the Company maintains internal policies for estimating and recording reserves to comply with the SEC definitions and guidance. Compliance with the SEC reserve guidelines is the primary responsibility of Anadarkos Reserve Management Group (RMG). The Company requires that reserve estimates be made by qualified reserves estimators (QREs), as defined by the Society of Petroleum Engineers standards. All QREs receive education on the fundamentals of SEC reserves reporting, including internal training programs administered by the RMG as well as external industry training.
The RMG is managed through the Companys Finance division, which is separate from its operating divisions, and is responsible for overseeing internal reserve reviews and approving the Companys reserve estimates. The DirectorReserve Administration and the Corporate Reserve Manager manage the RMG and the DirectorCorporate Planning is directly responsible for overseeing the RMG. The DirectorCorporate Planning reports to the Companys Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, who in turn reports to the Chief Executive Officer.
The Companys principal engineer, who is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of proved reserve estimates, has over 20 years of experience in the oil and gas industry, including over 16 years as either a reserve evaluator, trainer or manager. Further professional qualifications include a degree in petroleum engineering, extensive internal and external reserve training, and asset evaluation and management. In addition, the principal engineer is an active participant in industry reserve seminars, professional industry groups and has been a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers for over 20 years.
Throughout the year, the RMG performs internal audits of significant fields and significant reserve additions and revisions. The procedures and methods of over 80% of the Companys estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows, as of December31, 2009, were reviewed by Miller and Lents, Ltd. (M&L). The purpose of the review was to determine that procedures and methods used by Anadarko to estimate its proved reserves were based on generally accepted engineering and evaluation principles and are in accordance with definitions contained in the rules of the SEC. In each review, Anadarkos technical staff presented M&L with an overview of the reserves data, as well as the methods and assumptions used in estimating reserves. The data presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria. Subsequent to the reviews, M&L was provided with additional data and information that was requested in certain instances to satisfy M&L that the procedures and methods used were in accordance with standard industry practice. Managements intent in retaining M&L to review its procedures and methods is to provide objective third-party input on these procedures and methods and to gather industry information applicable to its reserve estimation and reporting process.
The Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors meets with management, the Companys senior reserves engineering personnel and the independent petroleum consultants, M&L, to discuss matters and policies related to reserves.

Through ownership and operation of these facilities, the Company is better able to manage its costs associated with, and value received for gathering, processing, treating and transporting natural gas. In addition, Anadarkos midstream business also provides midstream services to third-party customers, including major and independent producers. Anadarko generates revenues from its midstream activities through fixed-fee, percent-of-proceeds, and keep-whole agreements. For 2010, Anadarko plans to allocate approximately 8% of the Companys capital budget to the midstream segment.
Anadarko significantly increased the size and scope of its midstream business through its 2006 acquisitions of Western Gas Resources, Inc. (Western) and Kerr-McGee Corporation (Kerr-McGee). At the end of 2009, Anadarko had 28 systems located throughout major onshore producing basins in Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, NewMexico, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.
In 2008, Western Gas Partners, LP (WES), a subsidiary of Anadarko, completed its initial public offering of 20.8million common units for net proceeds of $321 million ($343 million less $22 million for underwriting 13 Table of Contents discounts and structuring fees). WES is a Delaware publicly traded limited partnership formed by Anadarko to own, operate, acquire and develop midstream assets. Anadarko contributed assets to WES in exchange for an aggregate 59.6% limited partner interest (consisting of common and subordinated limited partner units) in WES, a 2% general partner interest and incentive distribution rights (IDRs). IDRs entitle the holder to specified increasing percentages of cash distributions as WESs per-unit cash distributions increase. In addition, Anadarko maintains control over the assets owned by WES through its ownership of the general partner. Anadarko holds an aggregate 54.8% limited partner interest in WES, a 2% general partner interest and IDRs as of December31, 2009.

In marketing its production, the Company attempts to minimize market-related shut-ins, maximize realized prices, and manage credit-risk exposure. The Companys sales of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs are generally made at the market prices for those products at the time of sale. The Company also purchases natural-gas, crude-oil, condensate and NGLs volumes from third parties, primarily near Anadarkos production areas, to aggregate larger volumes, which in turn, better positions the Company to fully utilize transportation capacity, attract creditworthy customers, facilitate efforts to maximize prices received and minimize balancing issues with customers and pipelines during operational disruptions.
The Company sells natural gas under a variety of contracts. The Company has the marketing capability to move large volumes of gas into and out of the daily gas market to capitalize on price volatility. The Company may also engage in limited trading activities for the purpose of generating profits from exposure to changes in market prices of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs. The Company does not engage in market-making practices and limits its marketing activities to natural-gas, crude-oil and NGLs commodity contracts. The Companys marketing risk position is typically a net short position (reflecting agreements to sell natural gas, crude oil and NGLs in the future for specific prices) that is offset by the Companys natural long position as a producer (reflecting ownership of underlying natural-gas and crude-oil reserves). See Energy Price Risk under item 7A of this Form 10-K.
Natural Gas Natural gas continues to fulfill a significant portion of North Americas energy needs and the Company believes the importance of natural gas in meeting this energy need will continue. Anadarko markets its natural-gas production to maximize the commodity value and to reduce the inherent risks of the physical- commodity markets. Anadarko Energy Services Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Anadarko, is a marketing company offering supply-assurance, competitive-pricing and risk-management services in addition to other services which are tailored to its customers needs. The Company sells natural gas under a variety of contracts and may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer.
14 Table of Contents The Company controls a significant amount of natural-gas firm transportation capacity that is used to ensure access to downstream markets, which enhances the Companys ability to produce its natural gas. This transportation capacity also provides the opportunity to capture incremental value when pricing differentials between physical locations are present. The Company also stores natural gas in contracted storage facilities to minimize operational disruptions to its ongoing operations and to take advantage of seasonal price differentials. Normally, the Company will have forward contracts in place (physical-delivery or financial derivative instruments) to sell the stored gas at a fixed price.
Crude Oil, Condensate and NGLs Anadarkos crude-oil, condensate and NGLs revenues are derived from production in the United States, Algeria, China and other international areas. Most of the Companys U.S. crude-oil and NGLs production is sold under contracts with prices based on market indices, adjusted for location, quality and transportation. Oil from Algeria is sold by tanker as Saharan Blend to customers primarily in the Mediterranean area. Saharan Blend is a high-quality crude that provides refiners large quantities of premium products such as jet and diesel fuel. Oil from China is sold by tanker as Cao Fei Dian (CFD) Blend to customers primarily in the Far East markets. CFD Blend is a heavy sour crude oil which is sold into both the prime fuels refining market and the heavy fuel oil blend stock market. The Company also purchases and sells third-party-produced crude oil, condensate and NGLs in the Companys domestic and international market areas, as well as utilizes contracted NGLs storage facilities to capture market opportunities and to help minimize fractionation and downstream infrastructure disruptions.
CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS AND COMPETITION In 2008, most segments in the global economy experienced a sharp downturn. Markets improved in 2009, but economic uncertainty remained. This economic uncertainty, along with recent commodity price volatility, has made the creditworthiness, liquidity and financial position of the Companys counterparties increasingly difficult to evaluate. For this reason, the Company has emphasized its monitoring of counterparty risk. Although Anadarko has not experienced any material financial losses associated with third-party credit deterioration, in certain situations, the Company has declined to transact with some counterparties and has changed its sales terms to require some counterparties to pay in advance or post letters of credit for purchases.
The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisition of reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production. The Companys competitors include national oil companies, major oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, individual producers, gas marketers and major pipeline companies, as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial and individual consumers.
SEGMENT INFORMATION For additional information on operations by segment location, see Note 19Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
EMPLOYEES As of December31, 2009, the Company had approximately 4,300 employees. Anadarko considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory. The Companys employees are not represented by any union. The Company has had no significant work stoppages or strikes associated with its employees.
REGULATORY MATTERS, ENVIRONMENTAL AND ADDITIONAL FACTORS AFFECTING BUSINESS See Risk Factors under Item1A and Liquidity and Capital ResourcesObligations and ContingenciesEnvironmental under Item7 of this Form 10-K.
15 Table of Contents TITLE TO PROPERTIES As is customary in the oil and gas industry, only a preliminary title review is conducted at the time properties believed to be suitable for drilling operations are acquired by the Company. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations, a thorough title examination of the drill site tract is conducted and curative work is performed with respect to significant defects, if any, before proceeding with operations. Anadarko believes the title to its leasehold properties is good and defensible in accordance with standards generally acceptable in the oil and gas industry subject to such exceptions that, in the opinion of legal counsel for the Company, are not so material as to detract substantially from the use of such properties.
The leasehold properties owned by the Company are subject to royalty, overriding royalty and other outstanding interests customary in the industry. The properties may be subject to burdens such as liens incident to operating agreements and current taxes, development obligations under oil and gas leases and other encumbrances, easements and restrictions. Anadarko does not believe any of these burdens will materially interfere with its use of these properties.
16 Table of Contents Item1A.
Risk Factors CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The Company has made in this report, and may from time to time otherwise make in other public filings, press releases and discussions with Company management, forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 concerning the Companys operations, economic performance and financial condition. These forward-looking statements include information concerning future production and reserves, schedules, plans, timing of development, contributions from oil and gas properties, marketing and midstream activities and those statements preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words may, could, believes, expects, anticipates, intends, estimates, projects, target, goal, plans, objective, should or similar expressions or variations on such expressions. For such statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Anadarko undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
These forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainties. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Companys expectations include, but are not limited to, the following risks and uncertainties:  the Companys assumptions or expectations regarding energy markets;  production levels;  reserve levels;  operating results;  competitive conditions;  technology;  the availability of capital resources, capital expenditures and other contractual obligations;  the supply and demand for and the price of natural gas, oil, NGLs and other products or services;  volatility in the commodity-futures market;  the weather;  inflation;  the availability of goods and services;  drilling risks;  future processing volumes and pipeline throughput;  general economic conditions, either internationally or nationally or in the jurisdictions in which the Company or its subsidiaries are doing business;  legislative or regulatory changes, including retroactive royalty or production tax regimes, hydraulic-fracturing regulation, derivatives reform, changes in state and federal corporate taxes, environmental regulation, environmental risks and liability under federal, state, foreign and local environmental laws and regulations;  current and potential legal proceedings, environmental or other obligations arising from Tronox Incorporated (Tronox); 17 Table of Contents  the securities, capital or credit markets;  our ability to repay debt;  the outcome of any proceedings related to the Algerian exceptional profits tax; and  other factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in the Companys other public filings, press releases and discussions with Company management.
Oil, natural-gas and NGLs prices are volatile. A substantial or extended decline in prices could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs can fluctuate widely. Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our oil, natural gas and NGLs. Historically, the markets for oil, natural gas and NGLs have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. The factors influencing the prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:  domestic and worldwide supply of, and demand for, oil, natural gas and NGLs;  volatile trading patterns in the commodity-futures markets;  the cost of exploring for, developing, producing, transporting and marketing oil, natural gas and NGLs;  weather conditions;  the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producing nations to agree to and maintain production levels;  the worldwide military and political environment, uncertainty or instability resulting from the escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities or further acts of terrorism in the United States, or elsewhere;  the effect of worldwide energy conservation efforts;  the price and availability of alternative and competing fuels;  the price and level of foreign imports of oil, natural gas and NGLs;  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;  the proximity to, and capacity of, natural-gas pipelines and other transportation facilities; and  general economic conditions worldwide.
The long-term effect of these and other factors on the prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs are uncertain. Prolonged or substantial declines in these commodity prices may have the following effects on our business:  adversely affecting our financial condition, liquidity, ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations;  reducing the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can produce economically;  causing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects;  reducing our revenues, operating income and cash flows;  reducing the amounts of our estimated proved oil and natural-gas reserves;  reducing the carrying value of our oil and natural-gas properties;  reducing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and natural-gas reserves; and  limiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt.
18 Table of Contents Our domestic operations are subject to governmental risks that may impact our operations.
Our domestic operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and are subject to complex federal, state, tribal, local and other laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, permitting, changes in taxes, deductions, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering-rate controls, hydraulic fracturing and environmental protection regulations. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state, tribal and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws, including environmental and tax laws, and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. For example, currently proposed federal legislation, that, if adopted, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, includes the following:  Climate Change.
Climate-change legislation establishing a cap-and-trade plan for green-house gases (GHGs) has been approved by the U.S. House of Representatives. It is not possible at this time to predict whether or when the U.S. Senate may act on climate-change legislation. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has also taken recent action related to GHGs. Based on recent developments, the EPA now purports to have a basis to begin regulating emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act.
Taxes.
The U.S. Presidents Fiscal Year 2011 Budget Proposal includes provisions that would, if enacted, make significant changes to United States tax laws. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i)eliminating the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs, (ii)eliminating the deduction from income for domestic production activities relating to oil and natural-gas exploration and development, and (iii)implementing certain international tax reforms.
Hydraulic Fracturing.
The U.S. Congress is currently considering legislation to amend the federal Safe Drinking Water Act to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and natural-gas industry in the hydraulic-fracturing process. Currently, regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state level through permitting and other compliance requirements. This legislation, if adopted, could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the federal level.
Derivatives.
The U.S. Congress is currently considering derivatives reform legislation focusing on expanding Federal regulation surrounding the use of financial derivative instruments, including credit default swaps, commodity derivatives and other over-the-counter derivatives. Among the recommendations included in the proposals are the requirements for centralized clearing or settling of such derivatives as well as the expansion of collateral margin requirements for certain derivative market participants.
Our debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility.
As of December31, 2009, our total debt was approximately $12.7 billion, which included a $1.6 billion note payable from a midstream subsidiary to a related party. We also have various commitments for operating leases, drilling contracts and transportation and purchase obligations for services and products. Our financial commitments could have important consequences to our business. For example, they could:  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;  limit our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures, to engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt or to comply with any restrictive terms of our debt;  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate; and  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and fewer financial commitments.
19 Table of Contents A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.
As of December31, 2009, Standard and Poors (S&P) and Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) rated our debt at BBB- and Baa3, respectively, both with a stable outlook. Although we are not aware of any current plans of S&P or Moodys to lower their respective ratings on our debt, we cannot be assured that our credit ratings will not be downgraded. A downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our cost of capital or our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy. If we were to be downgraded, it could be difficult for us to raise debt in the public debt markets and the cost of that new debt could be much higher than our outstanding debt. The only outstanding debt we have that contains credit-rating-downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity date of the outstanding debt is a $1.6 billion midstream note held by one of our subsidiaries, the maturity of which could accelerate if our senior unsecured credit rating were to be rated below BB- by S&P or Ba3 by Moodys. The $1.6 billion midstream note is unconditionally guaranteed by Anadarko and, jointly and severally, by certain midstream subsidiaries. In addition, a downgrade in our credit ratings to below investment grade could result in additional collateralization requirements related to financial derivative liabilities with certain counterparties. At December31, 2009, the Company had liabilities of $146 million subject to credit-rating-downgrade triggers. See Note 8Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
We are, and in the future may become, involved in legal proceedings related to Tronox and, as a result, may incur substantial costs in connection with those proceedings.
Prior to its acquisition by Anadarko, Kerr-McGee, through an initial public offering and spin-off transaction, disposed of its chemical manufacturing business. A new publicly traded corporation, Tronox, resulted from this transaction. After the Tronox initial public offering and spin off, Kerr-McGee was acquired by Anadarko and as a result became a subsidiary of Anadarko. Under the terms of a Master Separation Agreement, which was entered into in connection with the Tronox initial public offering, Kerr-McGee agreed to reimburse Tronox for certain qualifying environmental-remediation costs associated with those businesses, subject to certain limitations and conditions and up to a maximum aggregate amount of $100 million. However, as described below, Tronox and third parties have claimed that Kerr-McGee and Anadarko have additional liability for costs allegedly attributable to the facilities and operations owned by Tronox and for Kerr-McGees activities prior to the date Anadarko acquired Kerr-McGee.
In January 2009, Tronox and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. In connection with these bankruptcy cases, Tronox filed a lawsuit against Anadarko and Kerr-McGee asserting a number of claims, including claims for actual and constructive fraudulent conveyance. Tronox alleges, among other things, that it was insolvent or undercapitalized at the time it was spun off from Kerr-McGee. Tronox seeks to recover an unspecified amount of damages, including interest, from Kerr-McGee and Anadarko as well as punitive damages, and litigation fees and costs. In addition, Tronox seeks to equitably subordinate and/or disallow all claims asserted by the Company in the bankruptcy cases.
The United States filed a motion to intervene in the Tronox lawsuit, asserting that it has an independent cause of action against Anadarko, Kerr-McGee and Tronox under the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act relating primarily to environmental cleanup obligations allegedly owed to the United States by Tronox. That motion to intervene has been granted, and the United States is now a co-plaintiff against Anadarko and Kerr-McGee in Tronoxs pending bankruptcy litigation.
In addition, a consolidated class action complaint has been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of purported purchasers of Tronoxs equity and debt securities between November21, 2005 and January12, 2009 against Kerr-McGee, Anadarko and others. The complaint alleges causes of action arising pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for purported misstatements and omissions regarding, among other things, Tronoxs environmental-remediation and tort claim liabilities. The plaintiffs allege that these purported misstatements and omissions are contained in certain of Tronoxs public filings, including filings made in connection with Tronoxs initial public offering. The plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, including interest thereon, as well as litigation fees and costs.
20 Table of Contents The adverse resolution of any proceedings related to Tronox could subject us to significant monetary damages and other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.
For additional information regarding the nature and status of these and other material legal proceedings, please see Legal Proceedings under Item3 of this Form 10-K.
Our proved reserves are estimates. Any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or assumptions underlying our reserve estimates could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many factors beyond our control that could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated. The reserve information included or incorporated by reference in this report represents estimates prepared by our internal engineers. The procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants. Estimation of reserves is not an exact science. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural-gas reserves and of future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, any of which may cause these estimates to vary considerably from actual results, such as:  historical production from an area compared with production from similar producing areas;  assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies;  assumptions concerning future oil and natural-gas prices, future operating costs and capital expenditures; and  estimates of future severance and excise taxes, workover and remedial costs.
Estimates of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of expected future net cash flows prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and the variance may be material. The discounted cash flows included in this report should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural-gas reserves attributable to our properties. In accordance with SEC requirements effective January1, 2010, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based upon average 12-month sales prices using the average beginning-of-month price, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower.
Failure to replace reserves may negatively affect our business.
Our future success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural-gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Our proved reserves generally decline when reserves are produced, unless we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. We may be unable to find, develop or acquire additional reserves on an economic basis. Furthermore, if oil and natural-gas prices increase, our costs for finding or acquiring additional reserves could also increase.
Poor general economic, business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
Recently, concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the United States mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the United States have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy.
These factors, combined with volatile oil, natural-gas and NGLs prices, declining business and consumer confidence, and increased unemployment, have precipitated an economic slowdown and a recession. Concerns 21 Table of Contents about global economic conditions have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad continues to deteriorate, or if an economic recovery is slow or prolonged, demand for petroleum products could continue to diminish or stagnate, which could impact the price at which we can sell our oil, natural gas and NGLs, affect our vendors, suppliers and customers ability to continue operations, and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
Our results of operations could be adversely affected by asset impairments.
As a result of mergers and acquisitions, at December31, 2009 we had approximately $5.3 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment, and more frequently when circumstances indicate likely impairment, by applying a fair-value-based test. Goodwill is considered impaired to the extent that its carrying amount exceeds its implied fair value. Various factors could lead to goodwill impairments that could have a substantial negative effect on our profitability, such as if the Company is unable to replace the value of its depleting asset base or if other adverse events, such as lower sustained oil and gas prices, reduce the fair value of the associated reporting unit.
We are subject to complex laws and regulations relating to environmental protection that can adversely affect the cost, manner and feasibility of doing business.
Our operations and properties are subject to numerous federal, state, tribal, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection from the time projects commence until abandonment. These laws and regulations govern, among other things:  the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released;  the issuance of permits in connection with exploration, drilling, production and midstream activities;  the protection of endangered species;  the release of emissions;  the discharge and disposition of generated waste materials;  offshore oil and gas operations;  the reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites; and  the remediation of contaminated sites.
In addition, these laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for our failure to comply with them or for any contamination resulting from our operations. Future environmental laws and regulations, such as proposed legislation regulating climate change, may negatively impact our industry. The cost of meeting these requirements may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For a description of certain environmental proceedings in which we are involved, see Legal Proceedings under Item3 of this Form 10-K.
We are vulnerable to risks associated with our offshore operations that could negatively impact our operations and financial results.
We conduct offshore operations in the Gulf of Mexico, Ghana, Mozambique, Brazil, China and other countries in West Africa. Our operations and financial results could be significantly impacted by conditions in some of these areas, such as the Gulf of Mexico, because we explore and produce extensively in those areas. As a result of this activity, we are vulnerable to the risks associated with operating offshore, including those relating to:  hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions;  oil field service costs and availability; 22 Table of Contents  compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations;  terrorist attacks, such as piracy;  remediation and other costs resulting from oil spills or releases of hazardous materials; and  failure of equipment or facilities.
In addition, we are currently conducting some of our exploration in the deep waters (greater than 1,000 feet) of the Gulf of Mexico, where operations are more difficult and costly than in shallower waters. The deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in its shallower waters. As a result, deepwater operations may require a significant amount of time between a discovery and the time that we can market our production, thereby increasing the risk involved with these operations.
Further, production of reserves from reservoirs in the Gulf of Mexico generally declines more rapidly than from reservoirs in many other producing regions of the world. This results in recovery of a relatively higher percentage of reserves from properties in the Gulf of Mexico during the initial few years of production and, as a result, our reserve replacement needs from new prospects may be greater there than for our operations elsewhere. Also, our revenues and return on capital will depend significantly on prices prevailing during these relatively short production periods.
We operate in other countries and are subject to political, economic and other uncertainties.
Our operations outside the United States are based primarily in Algeria, Brazil, China, Cote dIvoire, Ghana, Indonesia, Liberia, Mozambique and Sierra Leone. As a result, we face political and economic risks and other uncertainties with respect to our international operations. These risks may include, among other things:  loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation, war, piracy, acts of terrorism, insurrection and other political risks;  transparency issues in general and, more specifically, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption compliance issues;  increases in taxes and governmental royalties;  unilateral renegotiation of contracts by governmental entities;  difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations;  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies;  foreign-exchange restrictions; and  international monetary fluctuations and changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar as compared with the currencies of other countries in which we conduct business.
For example, in 2006, the Algerian parliament approved legislation establishing an exceptional profits tax on foreign companies Algerian oil production and issued regulations implementing this legislation. In response to the Algerian governments imposition of the exceptional profits tax, we notified Sonatrach of our disagreement with the collection of the exceptional profits tax. In February 2009, we initiated arbitration against Sonatrach with regard to the exceptional profits tax. For additional information, see Note 15Other Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
Our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade and taxation.
Realization of any of the factors listed above could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
23 Table of Contents Our commodity-price-risk management and trading activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose us to other risks.
To the extent that we engage in commodity-price-risk management activities to protect our cash flow from commodity price declines, we may be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. In addition, our commodity-price-risk management and trading activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:  our production is less than the hedged volumes;  there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement;  the counterparties to our hedging or other price-risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements; or  a sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil and natural-gas prices.
The credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect us.
We have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, investment funds and other institutions. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. We have exposure to these financial institutions through our derivative transactions. In addition, if any lender under our credit facility is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lenders commitment under our credit facility.
We may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.
Our business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production, gathering, processing and transportation of oil and gas, including hurricanes, blowouts, cratering and fire, any of which could result in damage to, or destruction of, oil and natural-gas wells or formations or production facilities and other property and injury to persons. As protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage, including certain physical damage, employers liability, comprehensive general liability and workers compensation insurance. However, we are not fully insured against all risks in all aspects of our business, such as political risk, business-interruption risk and risk of major terrorist attacks and piracy. The occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.
Material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the completion of and commencement of production from development projects.
We are involved in several large development projects. Key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of such projects include:  project approvals by joint-venture partners;  timely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies;  weather conditions;  manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment; and  commercial arrangements for pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons.
24 Table of Contents Delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the forward-looking statements related to large development projects.
The oil and gas exploration and production industry is very competitive, and some of our exploration and production competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do.
The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production. Our competitors include national oil companies, major oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, individual producers, gas marketers and major pipeline companies, as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial and individual consumers. Some of our competitors may have greater and more diverse resources upon which to draw than we do. If we are not successful in our competition for oil and gas reserves or in our marketing of production, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
The high cost or unavailability of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and other oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs of rigs, equipment, supplies and personnel are substantially greater and their availability may be limited. Additionally, these services may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The high cost or unavailability of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and other oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our drilling activities may not be productive.
Drilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. The costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:  unexpected drilling conditions;  pressure or irregularities in formations;  equipment failures or accidents;  fires, explosions, blow-outs and surface cratering;  marine risks such as capsizing, collisions and hurricanes;  title problems;  other adverse weather conditions; and  shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment.
Certain of our future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. While all drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Because of the percentage of our capital budget devoted to high-risk exploratory projects, it is likely that we will continue to experience significant exploration and dry hole expenses.
25 Table of Contents We have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.
Other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest. We have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non-operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital and lead to unexpected future costs.
Our ability to sell our natural-gas and crude-oil production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation.
The marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipeline facilities and tanker transportation. If any of the pipelines or tankers become unavailable, we would be required to find a suitable alternative to transport the gas and oil, which could increase our costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of the gas and oil.
Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control of Anadarko, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders.
Our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that may make a change of control of Anadarko difficult, even if it may be beneficial to our stockholders, including provisions governing the classification, nomination and removal of directors, prohibiting stockholder action by written consent and regulating the ability of our stockholders to bring matters for action before annual stockholder meetings, and the authorization given to our Board of Directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock.
In addition, Section203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.
We may reduce or cease to pay dividends on our common stock.
We can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at the current rate or at all. The amount of cash dividends, if any, to be paid in the future will depend upon their declaration by our Board of Directors and upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the levels of our capital and exploration expenditures, our future business prospects and other related matters that our Board of Directors deems relevant.
The loss of key members of our management team, or difficulty attracting and retaining experienced technical personnel, could reduce our competitiveness and prospects for future success.
The successful implementation of our strategies and handling of other issues integral to our future success will depend, in part, on our experienced management team. The loss of key members of our management team, including James T. Hackett, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, could have an adverse effect on our business. We entered into an employment agreement with Mr.Hackett to secure his employment with us. We do not carry key man insurance. Our exploratory drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced explorationists, engineers and other professionals. Competition for such professionals is intense. If we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.

Item3.
Legal Proceedings GENERAL The Company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits and is involved in governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims and environmental claims. The Company has also been named as a defendant in various personal injury claims, including claims by employees of third-party contractors alleging exposure to asbestos, silica and benzene while working at refineries (previously owned by predecessors of acquired companies) located in Texas, California and Oklahoma. While the ultimate outcome and impact on the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow of the Company.
TRONOX PROCEEDINGS In January 2009, Tronox and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. In connection with those bankruptcy cases, Tronox filed a lawsuit against Anadarko and Kerr-McGee asserting a number of claims, including claims for actual and constructive fraudulent conveyance. Tronox alleges, among other things, that it was insolvent or undercapitalized at the time it was spun off from Kerr-McGee. Tronox seeks, among other things, to recover an unspecified amount of damages, including interest, from Kerr-McGee and Anadarko as well as punitive damages, and litigation fees and costs. In addition, Tronox seeks to equitably subordinate and/or disallow all claims asserted by Anadarko and Kerr-McGee in the bankruptcy cases. Anadarko and Kerr-McGee have moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety. That motion has been briefed and argued, and is currently awaiting decision by the Court.
The United States filed a motion to intervene in the Tronox lawsuit, asserting that it has an independent cause of action against Anadarko, Kerr-McGee and Tronox under the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act relating primarily to environmental cleanup obligations allegedly owed to the United States by Tronox. That motion to intervene has been granted, and the United States is now a co-plaintiff against Anadarko and Kerr-McGee in Tronoxs pending bankruptcy litigation. Anadarko and Kerr-McGee have moved to dismiss the United States intervention complaint, but that motion currently has been stayed by order of the Court.
Tronox and the United States have entered into an agreement that contemplates, among other things, that the United States will receive an 88% interest in any recovery from the claims against Anadarko and Kerr-McGee that Tronox has asserted in the litigation described above. The remaining 12% interest in any recovery will be distributed to certain persons who have filed tort claims against the Tronox debtors in the bankruptcy cases. That agreement is subject to certain contingencies, including various levels of governmental approvals, definitive and final documentation, and final approval from the Court. That agreement could be opposed by other interested parties, including Anadarko and Kerr-McGee. Therefore, it is unclear whether this or any other such agreement between Tronox and the United States will be approved or implemented, or what, if any, effect such an agreement might have on the course, cost or outcome of the bankruptcy litigation.
In addition, a consolidated class action complaint has been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of purported purchasers of Tronoxs equity and debt securities between November21, 2005 and January12, 2009 against Kerr-McGee, Anadarko and others. The complaint alleges causes of action arising pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for purported misstatements and omissions regarding, among other things, Tronoxs environmental-remediation and tort claim liabilities. The plaintiffs allege that these purported misstatements and omissions are contained in certain of Tronoxs public filings, including in connection with Tronoxs initial public offering. The plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, including interest thereon, as well as litigation fees and costs.
These proceedings are at a very early stage and the Company intends to defend itself vigorously.
OTHER MATTERS The Company is subject to other legal proceedings, claims and liabilities which arise in the ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of Anadarko, the liability with respect to these actions will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow of the Company.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , which are included in this report in Item8, and the information set forth in Risk Factors under Item1A.
OVERVIEW Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is among the worlds largest independent oil and natural-gas exploration and production companies. Anadarko is engaged in the exploration, development, production and marketing of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs. The Company also engages in the gathering, processing, treating and transporting of natural gas. The Companys operations are located in the United States, Algeria, Brazil, China, Cote dIvoire, Ghana, Indonesia, Mozambique, Sierra Leone and several other countries.
Anadarko achieved its key operational objectives in 2009 by increasing sales volumes by 7% year-over-year, while spending 35% less on near-term projects, reducing lease operating expenses per unit by more than 20% year-over-year, and adding 314million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) of proved reserves before price revisions and divestitures. Anadarko ended 2009 with approximately $3.5 billion of cash on hand and retains the availability of its undrawn $1.3 billion revolving credit agreement (RCA), along with access to credit markets. Management expects this liquidity position and cash flow from operations to position the Company to satisfy its 2010 operational objectives and capital commitments.
MISSION AND STRATEGY Anadarkos mission is to deliver a competitive and sustainable rate of return to shareholders by exploring for, acquiring and developing oil and natural-gas resources vital to the worlds health and welfare. Anadarko employs the following strategy to achieve this mission:  identify and commercialize resources;  explore in high-potential, proven basins;  employ a global business development approach; and  ensure financial discipline and flexibility.
Developing a portfolio of primarily unconventional resources provides the Company a stable base of capital-efficient, predictable and repeatable development opportunities which, in turn, positions the Company for consistent growth at competitive rates.
Exploring in high-potential, proven and emerging basins worldwide provides the Company with differential growth. Anadarkos exploration success creates value by expanding its future resource potential, while providing the flexibility to manage risk by monetizing discoveries.
Anadarkos global business development approach transfers core skills across the globe to discover and develop world-class resources that are accretive to the Companys net asset value. These resources help form an optimized, global portfolio where both surface and subsurface risks are actively managed.
A strong balance sheet is essential for the development of the Companys assets and the ability to manage through commodity price cycles. Maintaining financial discipline enables the Company to capitalize on the flexibility of its global portfolio, while allowing the Company to pursue new strategic and tactical growth opportunities.

Anadarko employs strategies to manage volumes and mitigate the effect of price volatility, which is likely to continue in the future. Production of natural gas, crude oil and NGLs is usually not affected by seasonal swings in demand.
Natural-Gas Sales Volumes, Average Prices and Revenues 2009 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2008 2008 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2007 2007 (Percentages) (Percentages) United States Sales volumesBcf 809 8 % 750 7 % 698 MMcf/d 2,217 8 2,049 7 1,912 Price per Mcf $ 3.61 (53 ) $ 7.69 33 $ 5.80 Gas sales revenues (millions) $ 2,924 (49 ) $ 5,770 43 $ 4,043 Bcfbillion cubic feet MMcf/dmillion cubic feet per day The Companys daily natural-gas sales volumes increased 168 MMcf/d for the year ended December31, 2009, primarily due to increased production in the Rocky Mountain Region (Rockies) of 138 MMcf/d due to positive results from base production resulting from dewatering coalbed methane wells and higher production uptime due to favorable weather. An increase in production in the Gulf of Mexico of 54 MMcf/d related to favorable weather conditions as compared to hurricane-related downtime experienced during 2008. Also, runtime at Independence Hub increased during 2009 as compared to 2008 when export pipeline repair work resulted in downtime, partially offset by a decrease in production due to scheduled maintenance at Independence Hub. These increases were partially offset by a 24 MMcf/d decrease in the Southern Region resulting from natural production declines experienced while drilling programs were shifted from established fields to emerging shale plays.
Anadarkos daily natural-gas sales volumes increased for the year ended December31, 2008, excluding 2007 divested property volumes of 156 MMcf/d. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volumes in the Gulf of Mexico of 175 MMcf/d as a result of the start up of the Independence Hub and increased production in the Rockies of 162 MMcf/d due to improved drilling efficiencies allowing for more overall drilling, partially offset by decreased production in the Southern Region of 44 MMcf/d.
The average natural-gas price Anadarko received decreased for the year ended December31, 2009. This decrease was primarily due to higher year-over-year natural-gas production and storage volumes coupled with lower United States demand for natural gas, triggered by the economic downturn in the United States.
37 Table of Contents Anadarkos average natural-gas price increased for the year ended December31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to lower year-over-year natural-gas storage volumes coupled with lower liquefied natural-gas volumes available to the United States consumer, both of which were caused principally by increased demand in both Europe and Asia.

The increase in the Gulf of Mexico is attributable to additional production that came online during the fourth quarter of 2008, and favorable weather conditions as compared to 2008, which was impacted by export pipeline repair work and hurricane-related disruptions. The Rockies increase is attributable to production efficiencies related to an oil pipeline that was placed in service in 2009. These increases were offset by lower Algerian crude-oil sales volumes of 6 MBbls/d due to the timing of cargo liftings and variances in OPEC quotas.
Anadarkos daily crude-oil and condensate sales volumes decreased for the year ended December31, 2008, excluding 2007 divested property volumes of 15 MBbls/d, primarily due to lower crude-oil sales volumes of 13 MBbls/d in the Gulf of Mexico attributable to pipeline repairs resulting from 2008 hurricane activity, lower crude-oil sales volumes of 7 MBbls/d in Algeria, primarily from lower production due to maintenance, a statutory shutdown and production constraints implemented by OPEC during the fourth quarter of 2008, and lower crude-oil sales volumes of 3 MBbls/d in Alaska, partially offset by higher crude-oil sales volumes of 5 MBbls/d in the Rockies.
The average crude-oil price Anadarko received decreased for the year ended December31, 2009, primarily due to increased spare OPEC production capacity coupled with decreased global demand, particularly in the United States, Europe and Japan as a result of the economic downturn. Anadarkos average crude-oil price increased for the year ended December31, 2008. Crude-oil prices were strong in the first half of 2008, primarily due to limited excess production capacity, heightened geopolitical tension and increased demand in Asia.

The Companys daily NGLs sales volumes increased for the year ended December31, 2009, primarily attributable to a new processing train placed in service during the second quarter of 2009 at the Chipeta natural-gas processing plant, increased gas production in the Rockies, and improved recoveries in the Southern Region.
Anadarkos daily NGLs sales volumes were down for the year ended December31, 2008, primarily due to a 4 MBbls/d decrease associated with the 2007 divestitures.
The average NGLs price decreased for the year ended December31, 2009, primarily due to decreased global petrochemical demand as a result of the economic downturn. For the year ended December31, 2008, average NGLs prices increased primarily due to increased global petrochemical demand for the first three quarters of 2008. NGLs production is dependent on natural-gas and NGLs prices as well as the economics of the processing of natural gas to extract NGLs.
Gathering, Processing and Marketing Margin millions except percentages 2009 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2008 2008 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2007 2007 Gathering, processing and marketing sales $ 728 (33 )% $ 1,082 (27 )% $ 1,487 Gathering, processing and marketing expenses 617 (23 ) 800 (22 ) 1,025 Margin $ 111 (61 ) $ 282 (39 ) $ 462 For the year ended December31, 2009, gathering, processing and marketing margin decreased $171 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower prices for natural gas, NGLs and condensate, which led to reduced gas processing margins, lower margins associated with firm transportation contracts due to price differentials between supply and market areas, and unrealized losses on derivatives related to gas-storage activity which is seasonal in nature, i.e.
, the margin realized on the future sale of stored volumes covered by these derivative instruments will more than offset the recorded unrealized losses. These amounts were partially offset by increases in crude-oil marketing margins, and in NGLs marketing margins primarily due to inventory write-downs to market value taken in the fourth quarter of 2008.
For the year ended December31, 2008, gathering, processing and marketing margin decreased $180 million. The decrease resulted from lower marketing sales of $231 million primarily due to lower margins on firm transportation contracts and decreased third-party-marketing activity, a write-down of storage inventory due to lower commodity prices in the fourth quarter of 2008 and lower gathering and processing sales of $174 million, primarily due to lower volumes as a result of the 2007 divestitures. These amounts were partially offset by a $183 million decrease in costs associated with gathering and processing operations, primarily due to 2007 divestitures, a $39 million decrease in marketing transportation costs, and a reduction of accrued expenses related to a prior period of $29 million.
39 Table of Contents Gains (Losses) on Divestitures and Other, net Gains on divestitures in 2009 were $44 million, primarily related to proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties in Qatar. Gains on divestitures in 2008 were $1.2 billion, primarily related to the divestiture of certain oil and gas properties in Brazil, onshore United States and the Gulf of Mexico. Gains on divestitures in 2007 related primarily to the Companys asset-realignment program. During 2007, net gains of $4.1 billion related to divestitures of oil and gas properties and net gains of $574 million related to the divestiture of certain gathering and processing facilities. For additional information, see Operating ResultsDivestitures below .
In 2008, gains (losses) on divestitures and other, net includes a net $82 million ($52 million after tax) reduction related to corrections resulting from the analysis of property records after the adoption of the successful efforts method of accounting. This net amount includes a reduction of $163 million related to 2007. Management concluded that this misstatement was not material to 2007 interim and annual results, or to the 2008 period, and corrected the error in the first quarter of 2008.

In May 2007, KMOG filed a motion for summary judgment with the District Court for the Western District of Louisiana which ruled in favor of KMOG in October 2007. The DOI appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Fifth Circuit). In January 2009, a three-judge Fifth Circuit panel unanimously affirmed the District Courts ruling in favor of KMOG. At the end of March 2009, the DOI filed a petition for rehearing by the full Fifth Circuit ( en banc ), which was denied on April14, 2009. On July13, 2009, the DOI filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court, which was denied on October5, 2009.
Based on the U.S. Supreme Courts denial of the DOIs petition for review by the court, Anadarko reversed its $657 million accrued liability for royalties that could have been owed on leases listed in the 2006 Order, similar orders to pay issued in 2008 and 2009, and other deepwater Gulf of Mexico leases with similar price-threshold provisions. In addition, the Company reversed its $78 million accrued liability for unpaid interest on these amounts.
Effective October1, 2009, royalties and interest are no longer being accrued for deepwater Gulf of Mexico leases with price-threshold provisions.

Costs and Expenses millions except percentages 2009 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2008 2008 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2007 2007 Oil and gas operating $ 933 (15 )% $ 1,104  % $ 1,101 Oil and gas transportation and other 590 7 553 22 453 Exploration 1,107 (19 ) 1,369 51 905 For the year ended December31, 2009, oil and gas operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of cost savings programs initiated in response to the reduction in oil and gas prices experienced from 2008 into 2009. Cost savings were achieved through operating efficiencies, deferral of certain workovers and vendor negotiations. Additional reductions were due to lower production handling rates in the Gulf of Mexico, and a decrease in outside-operated expenses in Alaska and Algeria. For the year ended December31, 2008, oil and gas operating expenses increased primarily due to workovers and other field initiatives implemented to capture the increase in product prices from 2007 to 2008. Expenses for 2008 also included a full year of operations at Independence Hub. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with 2007 property divestitures.
40 Table of Contents For the year ended December31, 2009, oil and gas transportation and other expenses increased due to incremental transportation fees paid on increasing volumes in the Rockies, new processing agreements in certain areas of both the Rockies and Southern Region and drilling rig contract termination fees paid during the year. These increases were partially offset by a decline in certain fees related to surface owner agreements and certain processing agreements that are tied to product prices. For the year ended December31, 2008, oil and gas transportation and other expenses increased due to incremental transportation fees paid on increasing volumes in the Rockies, new processing agreements in certain areas of both the Rockies and Southern Region, a full year of demand fees at Independence Hub and an increase in certain fees tied to product prices.
Exploration expense decreased by $262 million for the year ended December31, 2009, primarily due to lower impairments of unproved properties of $205 million and lower geological and geophysical expense of $87 million. The decrease in impairments of unproved properties related primarily to Gulf of Mexico properties, partially offset by an increase in unproved property impairments in China. The decrease in geological and geophysical expense was primarily related to seismic data which was acquired and expensed in 2008 for Mozambique and Indonesia. Exploration expense increased by $464 million for the year ended December31, 2008, primarily due to a $337 million impairment of unproved properties in the Gulf of Mexico, a $55 million impairment of unproved properties in Trinidad, a $40 million impairment of unproved properties in Brazil, and a $34 million increase in geological and geophysical costs, primarily related to the acquisition of seismic data for Mozambique.

The increase was primarily related to a supplemental bonus plan, the payment of which was triggered by the Companys total-shareholder-return performance relative to a group of peer companies. The performance resulted in significantly increased market value relative to the peer-group-average performance, and all non-officer employees qualified for prescribed payments under the plan. For the year ended December31, 2008, G&A expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in employee severance and termination benefits, lower compensation expense and a decrease in contract labor expense, partially offset by higher pension plan expenses.
For the year ended December31, 2009, depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A) expense increased $338 million primarily due to a $237 million increase attributable to higher sales volumes and to $84 million of higher accumulated costs associated with acquiring, finding and developing oil and gas reserves. For the year ended December31, 2008, DD&A expense increased $354 million primarily due to a $416 million increase attributable to oil and gas properties due to higher costs associated with acquiring, finding and developing oil and gas reserves. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately $43 million due to lower sales volumes and a decrease in depreciation of other properties and equipment of $28 million primarily due to divestitures.
For the year ended December31, 2009, other taxes decreased primarily due to lower commodity prices, which resulted in lower United States production and severance taxes of $343 million, Algerian exceptional profits tax of $269 million, and Chinese windfall profits tax of $60 million as well as decreased ad valorem taxes of $32 million. For the year ended December31, 2008, other taxes increased primarily due to increased production and severance taxes of $194 million, Chinese windfall profits tax of $55 million and ad valorem taxes of $43 million. These increases were triggered primarily by higher commodity prices and were partially offset by a decrease in the Algerian exceptional profits tax expense attributable to a change in the estimate of the 2006 exceptional profits tax recognized during the first quarter of 2007.
Impairments for the year ended December31, 2009, related to $86 million of marketing operating segment assets, $22 million of oil and gas exploration and production operating segment properties in the United States 41 Table of Contents and $7 million of midstream operating segment assets. The marketing operating segment impairments related to the impairment of firm transportation contracts and LNG facility-site properties. Impairments for the year ended December31, 2008, related to $113 million of oil and gas exploration and production operating segment properties in the United States, $98 million of midstream operating segment assets and $12 million of marketing operating segment assets. The oil and gas exploration and production operating segment and midstream operating segment impairments were primarily a result of lower commodity prices at year-end 2008. The marketing operating segment impairments related to the impairment of firm transportation contracts.

The increase of $95 million was primarily related to foreign currency gains of $70 million primarily related to exchange-rate changes applicable to cash held in escrow pending final determination of the Companys Brazilian tax liability attributable to its 2008 divestiture of the Peregrino field offshore Brazil.
For 2008, the Company had total other expense of $52 million compared to total other income of $71 million for 2007. The decrease of $123 million was primarily related to lower interest income of $40 million due to lower average cash levels and lower interest rates in 2008, a $40 million loss related to environmental reserve adjustments and $54 million of impairment losses related to equity investments.
Income Tax Expense millions except percentages 2009 2008 2007 Income tax expense (benefit) $ (5 ) $ 2,148 $ 2,559 Effective tax rate 5 % 40 % 40 % The variance between the Companys effective tax rate and the 35% statutory rate in 2009 is primarily attributable to:  the accrual of the Algerian exceptional profits tax,  other foreign taxes in excess of the federal statutory rate, and  U.S. residual income tax on foreign income.
These amounts were largely offset by:  benefits associated with changes in uncertain tax positions,  state income taxes, including a change in the state income tax rate expected to be in effect at the time the Companys deferred state income tax liability is expected to be settled or realized, and  U.S. income tax impact from losses and restructuring of foreign operations and other items.
The variance between the Companys effective tax rate and the 35% statutory rate in 2008 is primarily attributable to the accrual of the Algerian exceptional profits tax, U.S. tax on foreign income, state income taxes and other items. In 2007, the variance from the 35% statutory rate is due to the Algerian exceptional profits tax, other foreign taxes in excess of federal statutory rates and state income taxes, partially offset by the foreign tax rate applicable to the Companys divestiture of its 50% interest in the Peregrino field offshore Brazil, which had a rate lower than the 35% U.S. statutory rate, and other items.
43 Table of Contents Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests For the years ended December31, 2009, and 2008, the Companys net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $32 million and $23 million, respectively. These amounts for the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008 related primarily to a 43.2% and 36.7% average public ownership interest, respectively, in Western Gas Partners, LP (WES), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company.
OPERATING RESULTS Segment AnalysisAdjusted EBITDAX To assess the operating results of Anadarkos segments, the chief operating decision maker analyzes income from continuing operations before income taxes, interest expense, exploration expense, DD&A expense and impairments, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (Adjusted EBITDAX). Anadarkos definition of Adjusted EBITDAX, which is not a GAAP measure, excludes exploration expense because exploration expense is not an indicator of operating efficiency for a given reporting period. However, exploration expense is monitored by management as part of costs incurred in exploration and development activities. Similarly, DD&A expense and impairments are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX as a measure of segment operating performance because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. The Companys definition of Adjusted EBITDAX also excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating results without regard to Anadarkos financing methods or capital structure. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX provides information useful in assessing the Companys financial condition and results of operations and that Adjusted EBITDAX is a widely accepted financial indicator of a companys ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions to stockholders.
Adjusted EBITDAX, as defined by Anadarko, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Therefore, Anadarkos consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX should be considered in conjunction with income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders and other performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as operating income or cash flow from operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes certain items that affect income from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of Anadarkos results as reported under GAAP. Below is a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes.

The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December31, 2008, was primarily due to a decrease in gains on divestitures and other, net of $3.1 billion and lower sales volumes as a result of the 2007 divestitures, partially offset by the impact of higher commodity prices and higher natural-gas sales volumes primarily in the Rockies and the Gulf of Mexico.
Midstream The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December31, 2009, resulted primarily from a decrease in revenue due to lower prices for natural gas, NGLs, and condensate, which impacted revenues earned under the Companys percent-of-proceeds and keep-whole contracts, partially offset by lower cost of product. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December31, 2008, resulted primarily from a decrease in gains on divestitures and other, net of $531 million and lower volumes as a result of the 2007 divestitures, partially offset by higher product prices and gathering rates. During July 2007, the Company divested its interests in two natural-gas gathering systems and associated processing plants. These divested facilities accounted for $75 million, or 21%, of Anadarkos midstream segments Adjusted EBITDAX for 2007, excluding gains on divestitures.
Marketing Marketing earnings represent primarily the margin earned on sales of gas, oil and NGLs purchased from third parties. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December31, 2009, was primarily due to a decrease of approximately 30% in marketed third-party volumes, and lower margins associated with firm transportation contracts due to price differentials between supply and market areas. These amounts were partially offset by higher crude-oil marketing margins, and higher NGLs marketing margins primarily due to inventory write-downs to market value taken in the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December31, 2008, was primarily due to lower margins on firm transportation contracts and the write-down of storage inventory due to lower commodity prices in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Other and Intersegment Eliminations Other and intersegment eliminations consists primarily of corporate costs that are not allocated to the operating segments, realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives and income from hard minerals investments and royalties. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December31, 2009, was primarily due to realized and unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives, partially offset by realized and unrealized gains and losses on interest-rate swaps. The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December31, 2008, was primarily due to realized and unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives, and decreases in employee severance and termination benefits, compensation expense and contract labor expense, partially offset by higher benefit plan expense and losses related to equity investments.
Divestitures In 2009, Anadarko divested certain oil and gas properties, primarily in Qatar, onshore United States and other international properties for proceeds of $109 million and certain midstream properties for proceeds of $67 million.
In 2008, the Company divested certain oil and gas properties, primarily in Brazil, onshore United States and the Gulf of Mexico for approximately $2.5 billion. Proceeds from 2008 divestitures were used to reduce debt.
In April 2008, Anadarko entered into an agreement to sell its wholly owned subsidiary that owns an 18% interest in Petroritupano, S.A. (Petroritupano), a Venezuelan company also owned by Petrleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) and Petrobras Energa, S.A., for $200 million. The closing of this transaction was subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of approvals by Venezuelan authorities. Anadarko was informed by the Venezuelan Ministry of Energy and Petroleum that it would not grant approval for the sale because PDVSA intends to acquire Anadarkos interest in Petroritupano. Anadarko subsequently received a letter from Corporacion Venezolana del Petroleo, S.A. (CVP), an affiliate of PDVSA, in which CVP stated its interest in acquiring Anadarkos ownership interest in Petroritupano. At this time, Anadarko is unable to determine when the sale to CVP will be completed. Anadarkos investment in Petroritupano is included in other assets at December31, 2009.
45 Table of Contents As a result of an asset-realignment program stemming from the acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western, Anadarko divested certain properties during 2007 for approximately $11.1 billion before income taxes. Net proceeds from these divestitures were used to reduce debt.
For additional information, see Note 2Divestitures and Other in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
Proved Reserves Anadarko focuses on growth and profitability. Reserve replacement is a key to growth. Future profitability depends partially upon the cost of finding and developing oil and gas reserves. Reserve growth can be achieved through successful exploration and development drilling, improved recovery or acquisition of producing properties.
The following is a discussion of proved reserves, reserve additions and revisions and future net cash flows from proved reserves. Additional reserve information is contained in the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities (Supplemental Information) under Item8 of this Form 10-K.

The Company expects the majority of future reserve growth to come from positive revisions associated with infill drilling and extensions of current fields and new discoveries onshore in North America and the deepwaters of the Gulf of Mexico, as well as through improved recovery operations, purchases of proved properties in strategic areas and successful exploration in international growth areas. The success of these operations will directly impact reserve additions or revisions in the future.
Additions During 2009, Anadarko added 70 MMBOE of proved reserves primarily as the result of successful drilling in the United States and at international locations. The Company also acquired 32 MMBOE of proved reserves in place related to onshore domestic assets in 2009. During 2008, Anadarko added 102 MMBOE of proved reserves primarily as the result of successful drilling in the Rockies and development and appraisal wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. During 2007, Anadarko added 131 MMBOE of proved reserves. Of this amount, 130 MMBOE were a result of successful drilling in CBM and conventional plays of the Rockies and the initial recognition of proved reserves at the Peregrino field offshore Brazil.
Revisions Total revisions in 2009 were 173 MMBOE or 8% of the beginning-of-year reserve base. The revisions included an increase of 212 MMBOE primarily related to large onshore natural-gas plays, such as the Greater Natural Buttes and Pinedale fields, as a result of successful infill drilling (where the reserve bookings for the infill wells are treated as a positive revision). The revisions include a decrease of 39 MMBOE driven by lower natural-gas prices. Total revisions in 2008 were 86 MMBOE or 4% of the beginning-of-year reserve base. The revisions included an increase of 188 MMBOE primarily related to Greater Natural Buttes, Wattenberg and Pinedale fields, as a result of successful infill drilling, and positive revisions to the Peregrino heavy-oil field, offshore Brazil, which was sold in 2008, partially offset by a decrease of 102 MMBOE related to prices for oil and NGLs. Total revisions for 2007 were 121 MMBOE, related primarily to infill drilling in large onshore natural-gas plays, and higher oil and natural-gas prices.
46 Table of Contents Sales in Place During 2009, the Company sold properties located onshore United States representing 24 MMBOE of proved reserves. In 2008, the Company sold properties located in the United States and Brazil representing 46 MMBOE and 91 MMBOE of proved reserves, respectively. In 2007, the Company sold properties located in the United States and Qatar representing 609 MMBOE and 11 MMBOE of proved reserves, respectively.
Discounted Future Net Cash Flows At December31, 2009, the discounted (at 10%) estimated future net cash flow from Anadarkos proved reserves was $13.6 billion (stated in accordance with the new regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)). This discounted future net cash flow was calculated based on beginning-of-month average prices for the year, held flat for the life of the reserves, adjusted for any contractual provisions. For reporting periods prior to December31, 2009, year-end prices were used for calculating discounted future net cash flows. The increase of $1.6 billion or 13% in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily due to positive performance from exploration and development programs. See Supplemental Information under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
The present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of Anadarkos proved reserves. A fair-value estimate would also take into account, among other things, anticipated changes in future prices and costs, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Anadarkos primary sources of cash during 2009 were cash flow from operating activities and proceeds from the issuance of debt and common stock. The Company used cash primarily to fund its capital program, retire debt and pay dividends. Anadarkos primary sources of cash during 2008 were cash flow from operating activities, proceeds from divestitures and the initial public offering of WES. In 2008, the Company used cash primarily to fund Anadarkos capital spending program, retire debt, pay income taxes, repurchase Anadarko common stock, pay dividends and redeem preferred stock. Anadarkos primary sources of cash during 2007 were proceeds from divestitures, cash flow from operating activities and proceeds from the issuance of a midstream subsidiary note to a related party. In 2007, the Company used cash primarily to retire debt, fund Anadarkos capital spending program and pay income taxes and dividends.
The Company has in place a $1.3 billion five-year RCA, entered into in March 2008 with a syndicate of United States and foreign lenders, and as of December31, 2009, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its RCA. Under the terms of the RCA, the Company can, under certain conditions, request an increase in the borrowing capacity under the RCA up to a total available credit amount of $2.0 billion. Anadarko was in compliance with existing covenants and the full amount of the RCA was available for borrowing at December31, 2009.
The Company continuously monitors its leverage position and coordinates its capital expenditure program with its expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule. The Company will continue to monitor the financial markets and evaluate funding alternatives, including property divestitures, borrowings under the Companys RCA and the issuance of debt or equity securities, based on its capital requirements. To facilitate a potential debt or equity securities issuance, the Company has the ability to sell securities under its shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2009.
The following section discusses significant sources and uses of cash for the three-year period ending December31, 2009. Forward-looking information related to the Companys liquidity and capital resources are discussed in Outlook that follows.
Sources of Cash Operating Activities Anadarkos cash flow from continuing operating activities in 2009 was $3.9 billion compared to $6.4 billion in 2008 and $2.8 billion in 2007. The decrease in cash flow from continuing operations for the year ended December31, 2009, is primarily attributable to lower commodity prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes and realized gains on interest-rate derivatives. In December 2008 and January 2009, 47 Table of Contents Anadarko entered into interest-rate swap agreements with a combined notional principal amount of $3.0 billion. In May and June 2009, the Company revised the contractual terms of this swap portfolio to increase the weighted-average interest rate it is required to pay and realized $552 million in cash.
The increase in cash flow from continuing operations for the year ended December31, 2008, was attributable to higher commodity prices and lower income tax payments in 2008 compared to 2007, when income tax payments were substantially higher as a result of 2007 divestiture activity. This increase in cash flow was partially offset by the cash impact of lower 2008 sales volumes which decreased as a result of 2007 divestiture activity, and an increase in realized derivative losses in 2008.
Fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the Companys short-term changes in cash flow from operating activities; however, Anadarko holds commodity derivative instruments that help to manage these cash flow fluctuations. Sales-volume changes also impact short-term cash flow, but have not been as volatile as commodity prices. Anadarkos long-term cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon commodity prices, production sales volumes, reserve replacement and the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations.
For additional information on the Companys interest-rate swap agreements, see Note 8Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
Investing Activities During 2009, 2008, and 2007, Anadarko closed several property divestiture transactions, and received proceeds of approximately $176 million, $2.5 billion and $8.3 billion before income taxes, respectively. For additional information, see Operating ResultsDivestitures above.
Financing Activities During 2009, Anadarko raised a total of $3.3 billion through the issuance of debt and equity as follows: millions Date Issuance NetProceeds March2009 7.625% Notes due 2014 $ 495 8.700% Notes due 2019 593 May 2009 Equity offering 1,337 June 2009 5.75% Notes due 2014 272 6.95% Notes due 2019 294 7.95% Notes due 2039 321 $ 3,312 During 2008, Anadarko raised $321 million in connection with the initial public offering of 20.8million common units of its consolidated affiliate, WES. See Note 3Noncontrolling Interest in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K. Proceeds from the offering were used to reduce debt.
During 2007, Anadarko raised a total of $2.2 billion through the issuance of a midstream subsidiary note payable to a related party and an additional $2.8 billion through borrowings from affiliates.

Capital expenditures represent additions to property and equipment excluding corporate acquisitions, property exchanges and asset retirement costs. Capital expenditures and costs incurred are presented on an accrual basis. Additions to properties and equipment on the consolidated statement of cash flows include certain adjustments that give effect to the timing of actual cash payments in order to provide a cash-basis presentation.
Anadarkos capital expenditures decreased 7% for the year ended December31, 2009 primarily due to declines in development drilling expenditures onshore United States and expenditures on gathering and processing facilities. These declines were partially offset by an increase in development drilling expenditures in Ghana, exploration drilling expenditures onshore United States, property acquisition costs and capital expenditures related to the Companys acquisition of its office buildings in The Woodlands, Texas. The Companys capital spending increased 22% for the year ended December31, 2008. The 2008 increase was due to an increase in development drilling expenditures primarily onshore in the U.S. and exploration lease acquisition activity primarily offshore in the U.S., partially offset by a decrease in expenditures related to construction, and gathering and processing facilities. Additionally, both 2008 and 2007 were impacted by rising service and materials costs. The mix of oil and gas spending reflects the Companys available opportunities based on the near-term ranking of projects by net asset value potential.
Property acquisitions in 2009 primarily related to exploratory non-producing leases onshore United States and proved property acquisitions related to property exchanges in the Rockies. Property acquisitions in 2008 primarily related to exploratory non-producing leases. Proved and unproved property acquisitions in 2007 include adjustments of $(600) million and $(484) million, respectively, related to finalizing the allocation of fair value to oil and gas properties acquired in connection with the acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western in 2006.
See Outlook below for information regarding sources of cash used to fund capital expenditures for 2010.
Debt Repayments At year-end 2009, Anadarkos total debt was $12.7 billion compared to total debt of $12.3 billion at year-end 2008 and $14.7 billion at year-end 2007. In 2009, the Company repaid an aggregate principal amount of $1.6 billion of debt that was outstanding at December31, 2008, including $1.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of Floating-Rate Notes due in 2009.
In 2008, the Company repaid an aggregate principal amount of $2.4 billion of debt that was outstanding at December31, 2007, including a variable-rate 354-day facility and $580 million in aggregate principal amount of Floating-Rate Notes due September 2009.
49 Table of Contents During 2007, Anadarko repaid $10.5 billion of indebtedness incurred in connection with its 2006 acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western.
For additional information on the Companys debt instruments, such as transactions during the period, years of maturity and interest rates, see Note 6Investments, Note 8Derivative Instruments and Note 10Debt and Interest Expense in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
Margin Deposits Both exchange and over-the-counter traded derivative instruments may be subject to margin deposit requirements. Exchange-broker margin requirements are determined by a standard industry algorithm, which requires a market-risk-based margin level be maintained on positions outstanding, from the date of trade execution through settlement. For derivatives with over-the-counter counterparties, the Company is required to provide margin deposits whenever its unrealized losses on derivative positions exceed predetermined credit limits. The Company manages its exposure to over-the-counter margin requirements through negotiated credit arrangements with counterparties, which may include collateral caps. When credit thresholds are exceeded, the Company utilizes available cash or letters of credit to satisfy margin requirements and maintains ample available committed credit facilities to meet its obligations. The Companys working capital position and its RCA are sufficient to satisfy margin deposit requirements resulting from a significant increase in commodity prices or from entering into additional derivative positions. The Company had margin deposits outstanding and held cash collateral of $105 million and zero, respectively, at December31, 2009. The Company had margin deposits outstanding and held cash collateral of $10 million and $3 million, respectively, at December31, 2008. See Note1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 8Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
Common Stock Repurchase Program In August 2008, the Company announced a $5 billion share-repurchase program under which shares may be repurchased either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The program is authorized to extend through August 2011. The program does not obligate Anadarko to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time. During 2008, Anadarko purchased 10million shares of common stock for $600 million under the program through purchases in the open market and under share-repurchase agreements. During 2009 and 2007, no shares were repurchased under the programs in effect at those times.
Dividends In 2009, 2008 and 2007, Anadarko paid $176 million, $170 million and $170 million, respectively, in dividends to its common stockholders (nine cents per share per quarter). Anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders continuously since becoming an independent public company in 1986. The amount of future dividends for Anadarko common stock will depend on earnings, financial conditions, capital requirements and other factors, and will be determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.
As of December31, 2009, the covenants contained in certain of the Companys credit and lease agreements provided for a maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio of 65%. The covenants do not specifically restrict the payment of dividends; however, the impact of dividends paid on the Companys debt-to-capitalization ratio must be considered in order to ensure covenant compliance. Based on these covenants, as of December31, 2009, the Companys debt-to-capitalization ratio was 39% and retained earnings of approximately $13.3 billion were not limited as to the payment of dividends.
The following table shows the Companys debt-to-capitalization ratio.
December31, December31, millions except percentages 2009 2008 Current debt $  $ 1,472 Long-term debt 11,149 9,128 Total debt excluding related party debt 11,149 10,600 Midstream subsidiary note payable to a related party 1,599 1,739 Total debt $ 12,748 $ 12,339 Stockholders Equity $ 19,928 $ 18,795 Debt-to-capitalization ratio 39.0 % 39.6 % 50 Table of Contents Outlook Anadarkos mission is to deliver a competitive and sustainable rate of return to shareholders by exploring for, acquiring and developing oil and natural-gas resources vital to the worlds health and welfare. Anadarko employs the following strategy to achieve this mission:  identify and commercialize resources;  explore in high-potential, proven basins;  employ a global business development approach; and  ensure financial discipline and flexibility.
Developing a portfolio of primarily unconventional resources provides the Company a stable base of capital-efficient, predictable and repeatable development opportunities which, in turn, positions the Company for consistent growth at competitive rates.
Exploring in high-potential, proven and emerging basins worldwide provides the Company with differential growth opportunities. Anadarkos exploration success creates value by expanding its future resource potential, while providing the flexibility to manage risk by monetizing discoveries.
Anadarkos global business development approach transfers core skills across the globe to assist in the discovery and development of world-class resources that are accretive to the Companys performance. These resources help form an optimized global portfolio where both surface and subsurface risks are actively managed.
A strong balance sheet is essential for the development of the Companys assets, and Anadarko is committed to disciplined investments in its businesses to manage through commodity price cycles. Maintaining financial discipline enables the Company to capitalize on the flexibility of its global portfolio, while allowing the Company to pursue new strategic and tactical growth opportunities.
The Companys capital budgeting process is ongoing. The Company plans to allocate approximately 65% of its capital spending to development activities, 25% to exploration activities and 10% to gas-gathering and processing activities and other items. The Company expects capital spending by area to be approximately 40% for the U.S. onshore region, which includes the Lower 48 region and Alaska, 20% for the Gulf of Mexico, 30% for International and 10% for Midstream and other. The Companys primary emphasis will be on managing near-term growth opportunities with a commitment to worldwide exploration and the continued development of large oil projects in Algeria, offshore Ghana and in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Anadarko believes that its expected level of operating cash flows and cash on hand as of December31, 2009, will be sufficient to fund the Companys projected operational and capital programs for 2010. However, if capital expenditures exceed operating cash flow and cash on hand, funds would likely be supplemented as needed through short-term borrowings under Anadarkos fully available $1.3 billion RCA or through the issuance of debt or equity.
In addition, to support 2010 cash flows, Anadarko has entered into strategic derivative positions as of December31, 2009, on approximately 75% of its anticipated natural-gas sales volumes and approximately 70% of its anticipated oil and condensate sales volumes for 2010. In addition, the Company has entered into commodity-price-risk management derivative positions for the years 2011 and 2012. See Note 8Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
The Company may choose to refinance certain portions of its short-term borrowings by issuing long-term debt or equity under its shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2009, or both. Also, the Companys $1.6 billion midstream note contains credit-rating-downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of this debt upon a downgrade of the Companys unsecured credit rating to below BB- by Standard and Poors (S&P) or Ba3 by Moodys Investors Service (Moodys). However, at December31, 2009, the Companys debt was rated BBB- with a stable outlook by S&P and Baa3 with a stable outlook by Moodys. Moreover, the Companys access to its $1.3 billion RCA and cash on hand is sufficient to fund the repayment of the $1.6 billion midstream note.
The Company continuously monitors its leverage position and coordinates its capital expenditure program with its expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule. The Company will continue to evaluate funding alternatives as needed, including property divestitures or borrowings under the Companys RCA and the issuance of debt or equity securities.
51 Table of Contents Credit Risks Credit risk is represented by Anadarkos exposure to non-payment or non-performance by the Companys customers and counterparties. Generally, non-payment or non-performance results from a customers or counterpartys inability to satisfy obligations. Anadarko monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and counterparties and establishes credit limits according to the Companys credit policies and guidelines. The Company has the ability to require cash collateral as well as letters of credit from its financial counterparties to mitigate its exposure above assigned credit thresholds. With respect to physical counterparties, the Company has the ability to require prepayments or letters of credit to offset credit exposure when necessary. The Company routinely exercises its contractual right to net realized gains against realized losses when settling with its financial counterparties, and utilizes netting agreements with physical counterparties where possible.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We may enter into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations. As of December31, 2009, the material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we have entered into include operating lease arrangements and undrawn letters of credit. Other than the off-balance sheet arrangements above, we have no transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources. See Obligations and Commitments for more information regarding off-balance sheet arrangements.
Other In 2007, Anadarko contributed certain of its oil and gas properties and gathering and processing assets, with an aggregate fair value of approximately $2.9 billion at the time of contribution, to newly formed unconsolidated entities in exchange for noncontrolling mandatorily redeemable interests in those entities. Subsequent to their formation, the investee entities loaned Anadarko an aggregate of $2.9 billion, which the Company used to repay its 2006 acquisition-related debt. Anadarko has a legal right to setoff and intends to net-settle its obligations under each of the notes payable to the investees with the distributable fair value of its interest in the corresponding investee. Accordingly, the $2.9 billion aggregate principal amount of such notes does not affect Anadarkos reported debt balance, since the notes and the carrying amount of Anadarkos investments in the investees are presented on the consolidated balance sheet on a net basis. The related interest expense on these obligations and Anadarkos equity earnings attributable to its investments in these entities are recorded in other income (expense), net.
Note 6Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K provides additional information with respect to each of these transactions. Completion of these transactions resulted in Anadarko divesting control of its interests in certain non-core exploration and production and midstream assets and operations, while retaining a participating 5% interest in profits, losses and residual value of the investees.
With respect to each investee, liquidation of the investee or redemption of Anadarkos interest in the investee is expected to result in Anadarko net-settling in cash its obligation under the corresponding note payable with the distributable fair value of its interest in the investee. The Company does not currently expect such net settlement to have a material effect on its future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Each of Anadarkos noncontrolling interests in the investees is optionally redeemable by Anadarko or the controlling investor in or after 2022 and is mandatorily redeemable in 2037.

(4) This table does not include the Companys pension or postretirement benefit obligations. See Note 20Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits and Employee Savings Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
Operating Leases Operating lease obligations include several deepwater drilling rig commitments. Anadarko continues to manage its access to rigs in order to execute its worldwide deepwater drilling strategy over the next several years. The Company believes these rig commitments offer compelling economics and facilitate its strategy. The portion of lease payments associated with successful exploratory wells and development wells, net of amounts billed to partners, will be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties.
The Company also has $0.9 billion in commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements for production platforms and equipment, buildings, facilities and aircraft.
For additional information see Note 13Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
53 Table of Contents Asset Retirement Obligations Anadarko is obligated to dispose of long-lived assets upon their abandonment. The majority of Anadarkos asset retirement obligations (AROs) relate to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas properties. The ARO is recorded at its estimated fair value, measured by reference to the expected future cash outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligation discounted at the Companys credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Revisions to estimated AROs can result from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation rates and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment.
Midstream and Marketing Activities Anadarko has entered into various transportation, storage and purchase agreements in order to access markets and provide flexibility for the sale of its natural gas and crude oil in certain areas.
Oil and Gas Activities Anadarko has various long-term contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development and production activities, which extend beyond 2010. The Company has work-related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic and fulfilling rig commitments. The preceding table includes long-term drilling and work-related commitments of $3,201 million, comprised of $1,857 million related to the United States and $1,344 million related to international locations.
The Company is obligated for approximately 27% of the construction costs of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO) that will be used in the Companys Ghana operations. Construction of the FPSO is expected to be complete in the first half of 2010. The Companys share of total construction costs is estimated to be approximately $224 million. At December31, 2009, the Company has accrued a net liability of $129 million representing Anadarkos net share of construction costs incurred to date, less amounts funded by Anadarko through loans or other payments to the contractor of approximately $60 million. The Companys obligation for construction costs is reported net of amounts previously funded as Anadarko has a contractual right to offset collection of the loans against the Companys construction cost obligation. The Companys remaining $35 million funding obligation is included in oil and gas activities in the preceding table.
Marketing and Trading Contracts At December31, 2009, the fair value of the Companys marketing and trading portfolio of physical delivery and financially settled derivative instruments was $6 million. See Critical Accounting Estimates for an explanation of how the fair value for derivatives is calculated.
Environmental Anadarko is subject to various environmental-remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state and local laws and regulations. As of December31, 2009, the Companys balance sheet included a $96 million liability for remediation and reclamation obligations, most of which were incurred by companies acquired by Anadarko. The Company continually monitors the liability recorded and the remediation and reclamation process, and believes the amount recorded is appropriate. For additional information on environmental issues, see Risk Factors under Item1A of this Form 10-K.
For additional information on contracts, obligations and arrangements the Company enters into from time to time, see Note 8Derivative Instruments, Note 10Debt and Interest Expense, Note 13Commitments, and Note 14Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
Discontinued Operations In November 2006, Anadarko sold its wholly owned subsidiary, Anadarko Canada Corporation. The results of Anadarkos Canadian operations have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows for 2008 and 2007 primarily related to adjustments to an indemnity obligation provided by the Company to the purchaser, as well as expenses associated with finalizing exit activities. See Note14Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods reported. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, including those related to the determination of properties and equipment, 54 Table of Contents proved reserves, goodwill, asset retirement obligations, litigation, environmental liabilities, pension liabilities and costs, income taxes and fair values. Changes in facts and circumstances or the discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates. Management considers the following to be its most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and discusses the selection and development of these estimates with the Companys Audit Committee.
Oil and Gas Activities Anadarko applies the successful efforts method of accounting to account for its oil and gas activities. Under this method, acquisition costs and the costs associated with drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending the determination of proved oil and gas reserves. Geological and geophysical costs and other costs of carrying properties such as delay rentals are expensed as incurred.
Acquisition Costs Acquisition costs of unproved properties are assessed for impairment during the holding period and transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent the costs are associated with successful exploration activities. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment, based on the Companys current exploration plans, and a valuation allowance is provided if impairment is indicated.
For unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs, costs are amortized on a group basis over the average lease terms at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration. Costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged against the valuation allowance, while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Amortization of individually insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases are included in exploration expense.
Significant undeveloped leasehold costs are assessed for impairment at a lease level or resource play (for example, the Greater Natural Buttes area in the Rockies), while leasehold acquisition costs associated with prospective areas that have had limited or no previous exploratory drilling are generally assessed for impairment by major prospect area.
A majority of the Companys unproved leasehold costs are associated with properties acquired in the Kerr-McGee and Western acquisitions in 2006 and to which proved developed producing reserves are also attributed. Generally, economic recovery of unproved reserves in such areas is not yet supported by actual production or conclusive formation tests, but may be confirmed by the Companys continuing exploration and development programs.
Another portion of the Companys unproved leasehold costs are associated with the Land Grant acreage, where the Company owns mineral interests in perpetuity and plans to continue to explore and evaluate the acreage.
A change in the Companys expected future plans for exploration and development could cause an impairment of the Companys unproved property.
Exploratory Costs Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploratory costs associated with a discovery well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending determination of whether proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activitiesin particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, whether development negotiations are underway or proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory drilling costs are expensed. Therefore, at any point in time, the Company may have capitalized costs on its consolidated balance sheet associated with exploratory wells that may be charged to exploration expense in a future period. At December31, 2009, suspended exploratory drilling costs were $579 million compared to $279 million at December31, 2008.
55 Table of Contents Proved Reserves In December 2009, Anadarko adopted revised oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements which conforms the definition of proved reserves with the SEC Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting rules, which were issued by the SEC at the end of 2008. The new accounting standard requires that the average, first-day-of-the-month price during the 12-month period preceding the end of the year, rather than the year-end price, be used when estimating reserve quantities and permits the use of reliable technologies to determine proved reserves, if those technologies have been demonstrated to result in reliable conclusions about reserves volumes. Prior-year data are presented in accordance with FASB oil and gas disclosure requirements effective during those periods; however, historical information has been reclassified to conform to the significant geographic areas required to be disclosed in 2009 under the revised accounting standard.
Anadarko estimates its proved oil and gas reserves as defined by the SEC and the FASB. This definition includes crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, government regulations, etc., i.e ., at prices as described above and costs as of the date the estimates are made. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, and do not include adjustments based upon expected future conditions.
The Companys estimate of proved reserves is made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions, as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits earlier. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on DD&A expense and could result in the recognition of an impairment.
Fair Value The Company estimates fair value for derivatives, long-lived assets for impairment testing, reporting units for goodwill impairment testing, certain exchanges, guarantees, pension plan assets, the initial measurement of an asset retirement obligation, and assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination. When the Company is required to measure fair value, and there is not a market-observable price for the asset or liability, or a market-observable price for a similar asset or liability, the Company generally utilizes an income valuation approach. This approach is based upon managements best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate. Such evaluations involve significant judgment and the results are based on expected future events or conditions, such as sales prices, estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput, development and operating costs and the timing thereof, economic and regulatory climates and other factors. The Companys estimates of future net cash flows are inherently imprecise because they reflect managements expectation of future conditions that are often outside of managements control. However, assumptions used reflect a market participants view of long-term prices, costs and other factors, and are consistent with assumptions used in the Companys business plans and investment decisions.
Business Combinations Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
Purchase Price Allocation The purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value. Estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired companys assets and liabilities and tax-related carryforwards at the merger date, although such estimates may 56 Table of Contents change in the future as additional information becomes known. The amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost.
Goodwill At December31, 2009, the Company had $5.3 billion of goodwill recorded related to past business combinations. Goodwill is required to be assessed for impairment annually, or more often as facts and circumstances warrant. The first step in assessing whether an impairment of goodwill is necessary is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets and goodwill. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment. Anadarko has allocated goodwill to three reporting units. These reporting units are oil and gas exploration and production, gathering and processing, and transportation. As of December31, 2009, these reporting units have a goodwill balance of $5.2 billion, $135 million and $5 million, respectively.
During 2009, the Company changed its goodwillimpairment testing date from January1 to October1. The Company completed its January1, 2009, and October1, 2009, annual goodwill impairment tests with no goodwill impairment indicated. Although Anadarko cannot predict when or if goodwill will be impaired in the future, impairment charges may occur if the Company is unable to replace the value of its depleting asset base or if other adverse events (for example, lower sustained oil and gas prices) reduce the fair value of the associated reporting unit.
Because quoted market prices for the Companys reporting units are not available, management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available information to make these fair-value estimates, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks associated with the assets and observed for the oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit, and market multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the gathering and processing and transportation reporting units.
In estimating the fair value of its oil and gas reporting unit, the Company assumes production profiles utilized in its estimation of reserves that are disclosed in the Companys supplemental oil and gas disclosures, market prices based on the forward price curve for oil and gas as of the test date (adjusted for location and quality differentials), capital and operating costs consistent with pricing and expected inflation rates, and discount rates that management believes a market participant would utilize based upon the risks inherent in Anadarkos operations.
For the Companys gathering and processing and transportation reporting units, the Company estimates fair value by applying an estimated multiple to projected 2010 EBITDA. The Company considered the relatively few observable transactions in the market, as well as trading multiples for peers to determine an appropriate multiple to apply against the Companys projected EBITDA for its gathering and processing and transportation reporting units.
A lower fair-value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in a goodwill impairment. Factors that could trigger a lower fair-value estimate include sustained price declines, cost increases, regulatory or political environment changes, and other changes in market conditions such as decreased prices in market-based transactions for similar assets. Based on our most recent goodwill impairment test, we concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit. Therefore, no goodwill impairment was indicated.
Impairment of Assets A long-lived asset other than unproved oil and gas property is evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may be greater than its future net undiscounted cash flows. Impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of an assets carrying amount over its estimated fair value. The Company utilizes an income approach when market information for the same or similar assets does not exist. This fair-value approach requires us to use managements best estimates, including asset production profiles and cost expectations, combined with inputs a market participant would use e.g.
, prices and discount rates.
57 Table of Contents Derivative Instruments All derivative instruments, other than those that satisfy specific exceptions, are recorded at fair value. If market quotes are not available to estimate fair value, managements best estimate of fair value is based on the quoted market price of derivatives with similar characteristics or utilizing industry-standard valuation techniques.
The Companys derivative instruments are either exchange-traded or transacted in an over-the-counter market. Valuation is determined by reference to readily available public data for similar instruments. Option fair values are measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and verified by comparing a sample to market quotes for similar options. Unrealized gains or losses on derivatives are recorded within Anadarkos current earnings.
Benefit Plan Obligations The Company has non-contributory defined-benefit pension plans, including both qualified and supplemental plans, and a foreign contributory defined-benefit pension plan. The Company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. Determination of the projected benefit obligations for the Companys defined-benefit pension and postretirement plans impacts the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet, the amount of benefit expense recorded to the income statement, and the Companys decision regarding amounts to be contributed to the plans.
Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate used for measuring the present value of future plan obligations, the fair value and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, rate of future increases in compensation levels and health care cost projections. Anadarko analyzes demographics and utilizes third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations.
Discount rate The discount-rate assumption used by the Company reflects the interest rate at which the pension and other postretirement obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date. The Company currently uses a yield curve analysis to support the discount-rate assumption for the plans. This analysis involves the creation of a hypothetical Aa spot yield curve represented by a series of high-quality, non-callable, marketable bonds, then discounts the projected cash flows from each plan at interest rates on the created curve specifically applicable to the timing of each respective cash flow. The present values of the cash flows are then accumulated, and a weighted-average discount rate is calculated by imputing the single discount rate that equates to the total present value of the cash flows. The consolidated discount-rate assumption is determined by evaluation of the weighted-average discount rates determined for each of the Companys significant pension and postretirement plans. The weighted-average discount-rate assumption used by the Company as of December31, 2009, was 5.25% and 5.5% for pension plans and other postretirement plans, respectively.
Expected long-term rate of return The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption was determined using the year-end 2009 pension investment balances by category and projected long-term target asset allocations. The expected return for each of these categories was determined by using capital-market projections. The Companys capital-market projection uses a forward-looking building-block approach and is not strictly based upon historical returns. Equity returns are generally developed as the sum of inflation, expected real earnings growth and expected long-term dividend yield. Bond returns are generally developed as the sum of inflation, real bond yield and risk spread (as appropriate), adjusted for the expected effect on returns from changing yields. Other asset class returns are derived from their relationship to the equity and bond markets. Consideration was also given to current market conditions. Anadarkos expected long-term rate of return is expected to be fairly consistent from year to year; however, it may change due to changes in asset-allocation targets, changes in financial market conditions and changes in the general economic outlook. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption used by the Company as of December31, 2009, was 7.5%.
58 Table of Contents Rate of compensation increases The Companys assumption is based on its long-term plans for compensation increases specific to covered employee groups and expected economic conditions. The assumed rate of salary increases includes the effects of merit increases, promotions and general inflation. The weighted-average rate of increase in long-term compensation levels assumption used by the Company as of December31, 2009, was5.0%.
Health care cost trend rate The health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. A 9.0% annual rate of increase in the per-capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2010, decreasing gradually to 5.0% in 2018 and later years.
Environmental Obligations and Other Contingencies Management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation, litigation and other contingent matters. Provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. Estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, the stage of investigation, the stage of the remedial design, evaluation of existing remediation technologies, and presently enacted laws and regulations. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Companys estimate of environmental-remediation costs, such as changes in laws and regulations, changes in the interpretation or administration of laws and regulations, revisions to the remedial design, unanticipated construction problems, identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater, and changes in costs of labor, equipment and technology. Consequently, it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the Companys estimates. The Companys in-house legal counsel and environmental personnel regularly assess these contingent liabilities and, in certain circumstances, third-party legal counsel or consultants are utilized.
Income Taxes The amount of income taxes recorded by the Company requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of various tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. The Company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and reduces such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company routinely assesses potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, establishes accruals for such amounts. The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are subject to a significant amount of judgment by Company management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances. Although management considers its tax accruals adequate, material changes in these accruals may occur in the future, based on the progress of ongoing tax audits, changes in legislation and resolution of pending tax matters.
59 Table of Contents RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS In June 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the consolidation standard applicable to variable interest entities. The amendments significantly reduce the previously required quantitative consolidation analysis, and require ongoing reassessments of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. This standard is effective for the Company on January1, 2010. The adoption of this standard will not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In January 2010, the FASB adopted changes to the definition of proved reserves, requiring proved reserves to be computed using the average, first-day-of-the-month price during the 12-month period before the end of the year, as well as allowing the use of reliable technology in determining estimates of proved reserves. These new reserve estimates will be used in determining depletion expense for the Companys oil and gas properties beginning January1, 2010. Adoption of these new definitions will not have a material impact on depletion expense recorded in future periods.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys primary market risks are attributable to fluctuations in energy prices and interest rates. These fluctuations can affect revenues and cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities. The Companys risk-management policies provide for the use of derivative instruments to manage these risks. The types of derivative instruments utilized by the Company include futures, swaps, options and fixed-price physical-delivery contracts. The volume of commodity derivative instruments utilized by the Company may vary from year to year and is governed by risk-management policies with levels of authority delegated by the Board of Directors. Both exchange and over-the-counter traded commodity derivative instruments may be subject to margin deposit requirements, and the Company may be required from time to time to deposit cash or provide letters of credit with exchange brokers or its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin requirements. For additional information see Liquidity and Capital ResourcesUses of CashMargin Deposits under Part II, Item7 of this Form 10-K.
For information regarding the Companys accounting policies and additional information related to the Companys derivative and financial instruments, see Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 8Derivative Instruments and Note 10Debt and Interest Expense in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
COMMODITY PRICE RISK The Companys most significant market risk relates to the pricing for natural gas, crude oil and NGLs. Management expects the prices of these commodities to remain volatile and unpredictable. As these prices decline or rise significantly, revenues and cash flow will also decline or rise significantly. In addition, a non-cash write-down of the Companys oil and gas properties may be required if future commodity prices experience a sustained and significant decline. Below is a sensitivity analysis of the Companys commodity-price-related derivative instruments.
Derivative Instruments Held for Non-Trading Purposes The Company had derivative instruments in place to reduce the price risk associated with future equity production of approximately 1 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of natural gas and 49 MMBbls of crude oil as of December31, 2009. At December31, 2009, the Company had a net liability derivative position of $101 million related to these derivative instruments. Utilizing actual derivative contractual volumes, a 10% increase in underlying commodity prices would reduce the fair value of these instruments by approximately $528 million, while a 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices would increase the fair value of these instruments by approximately $478 million. However, a gain or loss would be substantially offset by a decrease or increase, respectively, in the actual sales value of production covered by the derivative instruments.
Derivative Instruments Held for Trading Purposes At December31, 2009, the Company had a net asset derivative position of $6 million related to derivative instruments entered into for trading purposes. Utilizing actual derivative contractual volumes, a 10% increase or decrease in underlying commodity prices would result in a loss or gain, respectively, on these derivative instruments of approximately $8 million or $9 million, respectively.
For additional information regarding the Companys marketing and trading portfolio, see Marketing Activities under Items1 and 2 of this Form 10-K.
INTEREST-RATE RISK As of December31, 2009, Anadarko had outstanding $1.6 billion of variable-rate debt (Midstream Subsidiary Note Payable to a Related Party) and $11.1 billion of fixed-rate debt. A 10% increase in LIBOR interest rates would increase gross interest expense by approximately $0.4 million per year.
In December 2008 and January 2009, Anadarko entered into interest-rate swap agreements with a combined notional principal amount of $3.0 billion, whereby the Company locked in a fixed interest rate in exchange for a floating interest rate indexed to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The Companys intent is to settle these positions at the earlier of the related debt issuance or the start date of the swaps. A 10% increase or decrease in the three-month LIBOR interest-rate curve would increase or decrease, respectively, the fair value of outstanding interest-rate swap agreements by approximately $117 million. At December31, 2009, the Company had a net asset derivative position of $50 million related to interest-rate swaps. For a summary of the Companys open interest-rate derivative positions, see Note 8Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.

70 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies General Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is engaged in the exploration, development, production, and marketing of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs). The Company also engages in the gathering, processing, treating and transporting of natural gas, as well as participates in the hard minerals business through its ownership in non-operated joint ventures and royalty arrangements. The terms Anadarko and Company refer to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Anadarko and entities in which it holds a controlling financial interest. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures are consolidated on a proportionate basis. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Investments in non-controlled entities over which Anadarko exercises significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Other investments are carried at cost. Certain amounts for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
The Company changed the manner in which gains and losses on commodity derivatives, used to economically hedge production, are presented within the Consolidated Statements of Income to provide enhanced transparency into asset-operating performance. Previously, all realized and unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives were reported in gas sales, oil and condensate sales, or NGLs sales. (Gains) losses on commodity derivatives are now presented as a separate line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. See Derivative Instruments below.
Use of Estimates In preparing financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Management reviews its estimates periodically, including those related to the carrying value of properties and equipment, proved reserves, goodwill, intangible assets, asset retirement obligations, litigation reserves, environmental liabilities, pension assets and liabilities and costs, income taxes, and fair values. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates.
Fair Value Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or price paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard characterizes inputs used in determining fair value according to a hierarchy that prioritizes those inputs based upon the degree to which they are observable. The three levels of the fair-value-measurement hierarchy are as follows: Level 1-inputs represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (for example, exchange-traded commodity derivatives).
Level 2-inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (for example, quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets not considered to be active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, or market-corroborated inputs).
Level 3-inputs that are not observable from objective sources, such as the Companys internally developed assumptions used in pricing an asset or liability (for example, an estimate of future cash flows used in the Companys internally developed present value of future cash flows model that underlies the fair-value measurement).
71 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) In determining fair value, the Company utilizes observable market data when available, or models that incorporate observable market data. In addition to market information, the Company incorporates transaction-specific details that, in managements judgment, market participants would take into account in measuring fair value.
In arriving at fair-value estimates, the Company utilizes the most observable inputs available for the valuation technique employed. If a fair-value measurement reflects inputs at multiple levels within the hierarchy, the fair-value measurement is characterized based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair-value measurement. For Anadarko, recurring fair-value measurements are performed for interest-rate derivatives, commodity derivatives, investments in trading securities and pension assets.
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable reported on the balance sheet approximates fair value.
Nonfinancial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value include certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, impaired long-lived assets (asset groups), intangible assets and goodwill, and asset retirement obligations and exit or disposal costs.
Revenues The Company recognizes sales revenues for gas, oil and condensate, and NGLs based on the amount of each product sold to purchasers when delivery to the purchaser has occurred and title has transferred. This occurs when product has been delivered to a pipeline or a tanker lifting has occurred. The Company follows the sales method of accounting for natural-gas production imbalances. If the Companys sales volumes for a well exceed the estimated remaining recoverable reserves of the well, a liability is recognized. No receivables are recorded for those wells on which the Company has taken less than its proportionate share of production.
Realized gains and losses on derivative instruments that received cash flow hedge accounting treatment are included in gas sales, oil and condensate sales and NGLs sales. The Company discontinued hedge accounting effective January1, 2007, as discussed in Derivative Instruments below.
The Company enters into buy/sell arrangements for a portion of its crude-oil production. Under these arrangements, barrels are sold at prevailing market prices at a location, and in an additional transaction entered into in contemplation of the sale transaction with the same third party, barrels are re-purchased at a different location at the market prices prevailing at that location. The barrels are then sold at prevailing market prices at the re-purchase location. These arrangements are often required by private transporters. In these transactions, the re-purchase price is more than the original sales price with the difference representing a transportation fee. Other buy/sell arrangements are entered in order to shift the ultimate sales point of the Companys production to a more liquid location, thereby avoiding potential marketing fees and other market-price reductions. In these transactions, the sales price in the field and the re-purchase price are each at prevailing market prices at the respective locations. Anadarko uses these buy/sell arrangements in its marketing and trading activities and, as such, reports these transactions in the income statement on a net basis.
Anadarko provides gathering, processing, treating, and transportation services pursuant to a variety of contracts. Under these arrangements, the Company receives fees, or retains a percentage of products or a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of products and recognizes revenue at the time the services are performed or product is sold. These revenues are included in gathering, processing and marketing sales.
Marketing margins related to the Companys production are included in gas sales, oil and condensate sales and NGLs sales. Marketing margins related to sales of commodities purchased from third parties, as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses on such marketing activities, are included in gathering, processing and marketing sales.
Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
72 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Inventories Commodity inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market.
Properties and Equipment Properties and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A). Costs of improvements that appreciably improve the efficiency or productive capacity of existing properties or extend their lives are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of properties and equipment, net of the related accumulated DD&A, is removed and, if appropriate, gain or loss is recognized in gains (losses) on divestitures and other, net.
Oil and Gas Properties The Company applies the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties. Under successful efforts, exploration costs such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals and exploration overhead are charged against earnings as incurred. Acquisition costs and costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling the well. If management determines that commercial quantities of hydrocarbons have not been discovered, capitalized costs associated with exploratory wells are charged to exploration expense. Acquisition costs of unproved leaseholds are assessed for impairment during the holding period and transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent associated with successful exploration activities. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment, based on the Companys current exploration plans, and a valuation allowance is provided if impairment is indicated. Unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs are amortized on a group basis (thereby establishing a valuation allowance) over the average terms of the leases, at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration or abandonment. Costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged against the valuation allowance, while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Costs of maintaining and retaining undeveloped leaseholds, as well as amortization of individually insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases, are included in exploration expense.
Capitalized Interest Interest is capitalized as part of the historical cost of developing and constructing assets for significant projects. Significant oil and gas investments in unproved properties, significant exploration and development projects for which DD&A expense is not currently recognized, and exploration or development activities that are in progress qualify for interest capitalization. Interest is capitalized until the asset is ready for service. Capitalized interest is determined by multiplying the Companys weighted-average borrowing cost on debt by the average amount of qualifying costs incurred. Once an asset subject to interest capitalization is completed and placed in service, the associated capitalized interest is expensed through depreciation or impairment, along with other capitalized costs related to that asset.
Asset Retirement Obligations An asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset is recognized as a liability in the period incurred, with an associated increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The cost of the tangible asset, including the asset retirement cost, is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. The asset retirement obligation is recorded at its estimated fair value, measured by reference to the expected future cash outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligation discounted at the Companys credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. If the estimated future cost of the asset retirement obligation changes, an adjustment is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the long-lived asset. Revisions to estimated asset retirement obligations can result from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation rates and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment.
73 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Impairments Properties and equipment, net of salvage value, are reviewed for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of cash flows from other assets when facts and circumstances indicate that their net book values may not be recoverable. In performing this review, an undiscounted cash flow test is performed on the impairment unit. If the sum of these undiscounted estimated future net cash flows is less than the net book value of the property, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess, if any, of the propertys net book value over its estimated fair value.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Costs of drilling and equipping successful exploratory wells, development wells, costs to construct or acquire facilities other than offshore platforms and associated asset retirement costs are depreciated using the unit-of-production method based on total estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves. Costs of acquiring proved properties, including leasehold acquisition costs transferred from unproved leaseholds and costs to construct or acquire offshore platforms and associated asset retirement costs, are depleted using the unit-of-production method based on total estimated proved developed and undeveloped reserves. Mineral properties are depleted using the unit-of-production method. All other properties are stated at historical acquisition cost, net of allowance for impairment, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 15 years for furniture and equipment, up to 40 years for buildings, and up to 47 years for gathering facilities.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of a business over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company assesses the carrying amount of goodwill by testing the goodwill for impairment annually, unless facts and circumstances make it necessary to test more frequently. During 2009, the Company changed its annual goodwill impairment testing date from January1 to October1. As a result, goodwill was tested for impairment at both January1 and October1 in 2009. The impairment test requires an allocation of goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to business levels referred to as reporting units. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment. Anadarko has allocated goodwill to three reporting units: oil and gas exploration and production, gathering and processing, and transportation. The fair value of each reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, including goodwill, then the goodwill is written down to the implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to expense.
Changes in goodwill may result from, among other things, impairments, future acquisitions or future divestitures.
Other intangible assets represent contractual rights obtained in connection with a business combination that had favorable contractual terms relative to market as of the acquisition date. Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever impairment indicators are present. See Note7.
Derivative Instruments Anadarko utilizes derivative instruments in its marketing and trading activities and to manage price risk attributable to the Companys forecasted sales of oil, natural-gas and NGLs production. Anadarko also periodically utilizes derivatives to manage its exposure associated with natural-gas processing, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. All derivatives that do not satisfy the normal purchases and sales exception criteria are carried on the balance sheet at fair value and are included in other current assets, other assets, accrued expenses or other long-term liabilities, depending on the derivative position and the expected timing of settlement. To the extent a legal right of offset with a counterparty exists, the Company reports derivative assets and liabilities on a net basis. Anadarko has exposure to credit risk to the extent the derivative-instrument counterparty is unable to satisfy its settlement commitment. The Company actively monitors the creditworthiness of each counterparty and assesses the impact, if any, on its derivative positions.
74 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Through the end of 2006, Anadarko applied hedge accounting to certain commodity and interest-rate derivatives whereby gains and losses on these instruments were recognized in earnings in the same period in which the specifically identified hedged transactions affected earnings. Effective January1, 2007, Anadarko discontinued its application of hedge accounting to all derivatives. As a result of this change, both realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments are recognized on a current basis. Net derivative losses attributable to derivatives previously subject to hedge accounting reside in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December31, 2009 and will be reclassified to earnings in future periods as the economic transactions to which the derivatives relate affect earnings. See Note 8.
Accounts Payable Accounts payable includes property expenditure accruals of $741million and $579million at December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Also included in accounts payable at December31, 2009 and 2008 are liabilities of $252million and $391million, respectively, representing the amount by which checks issued, but not presented to the Companys banks for collection, exceed balances in applicable bank accounts, and changes in these liabilities are reflected in cash flows from financing activities.
Legal Contingencies The Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims and liabilities which arise in the ordinary course of its business. Except for legal contingencies acquired in a business combination, which are recorded at fair value, the Company accrues for losses associated with legal claims when such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes available or circumstances change. See Note 14.
Environmental Contingencies Except for environmental contingencies acquired in a business combination, which are recorded at fair value, the Company accrues for losses associated with environmental-remediation obligations when such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Accruals for estimated losses from environmental-remediation obligations are recognized no later than the time of the completion of the remediation feasibility study. These accruals are adjusted as additional information becomes available or as circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures for environmental-remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value. Recoveries of environmental-remediation costs from other parties are recorded at undiscounted value as assets when receipt is deemed probable. See Note 14.
Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits and Employee Savings Plans The Company measures pension plan assets at fair value. Pension plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating the use of various assumptions. Critical assumptions for pension and other postretirement plans include the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for funded pension plans). Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, turnover and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies the assumptions as necessary. See Note 20.
Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests represent third-party ownership in the net assets of the Companys consolidated subsidiaries and are presented as a component of equity. Changes in Anadarkos ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in deconsolidation are recognized in equity. See Note 3.
Income Taxes The Company files various United States federal, state and foreign income tax returns. Deferred federal, state and foreign income taxes are provided on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position and will record the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. See Note 16.
75 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation at fair value. The Company grants various types of stock-based awards including stock options, non-vested equity shares (restricted stock awards and units) and performance-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Restricted stock awards and units are valued using the market price of Anadarko common stock on the grant date. For performance-based awards, the fair value of the market-condition portion of the award is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation, and the performance-condition portion is measured at the market price of Anadarko common stock on the grant date. Liability-classified awards are remeasured at estimated fair value at the end of each period based on the specifications of each plan. The Company records compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, for stock-based compensation awards over the requisite service period. As each award vests, an adjustment is made to compensation cost for any difference between the estimated forfeitures and the actual forfeitures related to the vested awards. For equity awards that contain service and market conditions, compensation cost is recorded using the straight-line method. If the requisite service period is satisfied, compensation cost is not adjusted unless the award contains a performance condition. If an award contains a performance condition, expense is recognized only for those shares that ultimately vest using the per-share fair value measured at the grant date. See Note 12.
Discontinued Operations The Companys Canadian operations have been classified as discontinued operations for 2007 and 2008. Unless otherwise indicated, information presented in the notes to the financial statements relates only to Anadarkos continuing operations. See Note 2.
Earnings Per Share The Companys basic earnings per share (EPS) amounts have been computed based on the average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period and include the effect of any participating securities as appropriate. Diluted EPS includes the effect of the Companys outstanding stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance-based stock awards if the inclusion of these items is dilutive. Diluted net loss per share for the year ended December31, 2009, does not assume an increase in the average number of shares outstanding from future stock option exercises, unvested restricted stock or performance-based stock awards because the inclusion of shares attributable to these sources would have an anti-dilutive effect. See Note 11.
Changes in Accounting Principles The Company adopted a new fair-value-measurement standard as of January1, 2008. The standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under existing accounting pronouncements that require fair-value measurements and expands fair-value-measurement disclosures. The Company elected to implement the standard with the one-year deferral permitted for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those nonfinancial items recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually). The deferral period ended on January1, 2009. Accordingly, the Company now applies the fair-value framework to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities initially measured at fair value, such as assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, impaired long-lived assets (asset groups), intangible assets and goodwill, and initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and exit or disposal costs. Also, during the fourth quarter of 2009, Anadarko adopted a standard that requires expanded fair-value-measurement disclosures related to pensions.
The Company adopted a new standard for its derivative instruments and hedging activities, effective January1, 2009. The standard does not change the Companys accounting for derivatives, but requires enhanced disclosures regarding the Companys methodology and purpose for entering into derivative instruments, accounting for derivative instruments and related hedged items (if any), and the impact of derivative instruments on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 8.
The Company adopted new accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of subsidiaries, effective January1, 2009. Specifically, these standards require the 76 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) recognition of noncontrolling interests (formerly referred to as minority interests) as a component of total equity. Prior to January1, 2009, the share of a subsidiarys net assets allocable to minority interest investors was reported outside of equity. These standards also establish a single method of accounting for changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation and specifically provide that dispositions of subsidiary stock are required to be accounted for as equity transactions with no gain or loss recognized upon disposal. Finally, consolidated net income and comprehensive income are presented to include amounts attributable to both the parent and noncontrolling interests. All prior periods have been conformed to the current-year presentation.
The Company adopted a new accounting standard for business combinations, effective January1, 2009. The standard applies prospectively to the Company for future business combinations. The standard expands the definition of what qualifies as a business, thereby increasing the scope of transactions that qualify as business combinations. Furthermore, under the standard, changes in estimates of income tax liabilities existing at the date of, or arising in connection with, past business combinations are accounted for as adjustments to current-period income as opposed to adjustments to goodwill. The adoption of the standard had no impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
The Company adopted a new standard on determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions constitute participating securities, effective January1, 2009. This standard addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting, and therefore included in the allocation of earnings for purposes of computing EPS. Unvested share-based payment awards, whether paid or unpaid, that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents constitute participating securities and are included in the computation of EPS. The Companys restricted stock awards and restricted stock units contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends, thereby qualifying these instruments as participating securities and requiring the underlying securities to be taken into account for purposes of computing EPS. However, because the Companys restricted stock awards and restricted stock units do not participate in losses, these instruments were not taken into account for purposes of calculating EPS for the year ended December31, 2009. All prior periods have been conformed to the current-year presentation. See Note 11.
The Company adopted a new standard on subsequent events, effective April1, 2009. The standard defines subsequent events as either recognized subsequent events (events that provide additional evidence about conditions at the balance sheet date) or nonrecognized subsequent events (events that provide evidence about conditions that arose after the balance sheet date). Recognized subsequent events are recorded in the financial statements for the current period presented, while nonrecognized subsequent events are not. Both types of subsequent events require disclosure in the consolidated financial statements if nondisclosure of such events causes the financial statements to be misleading. The adoption of this standard had no impact on the financial statements of the Company. The Company has evaluated subsequent events through February23, 2010.
During the third quarter of 2009, the Company changed its annual goodwill impairment testing date from January1 to October1 of each year. This change ensures the completion of the annual goodwill impairment test prior to the end of the annual reporting period, thereby aligning impairment testing procedures with year-end financial reporting. Accordingly, management considers this accounting change preferable. This change did not accelerate, delay, avoid, or cause an impairment charge, nor did this change result in adjustments to previously issued financial statements. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2009, with no impairment indicated.
In December 2009, Anadarko adopted revised oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements. The primary impact of the new disclosures for Anadarko is to align the definition of proved reserves with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting rules, which were issued by the SEC at the end of 2008. The accounting standards update revised the definition of proved oil and gas reserves to require that the average, first-day-of-the-month price during the 12-month period preceding the end of 77 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) the year rather than the year-end price, must be used when estimating whether reserve quantities are economical to produce. This same 12-month average price is also used in calculating the aggregate amount of (and changes in) future cash inflows related to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. The rules also allow for the use of reliable technology to estimate proved oil and gas reserves, if those technologies have been demonstrated to result in reliable conclusions about reserve volumes. The unaudited supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities for 2009 has been presented following these new reserve estimation and disclosure rules, which may not be applied retrospectively. The 2006, 2007, and 2008 data are presented in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) oil and gas disclosure requirements effective during those respective periods. However, historical information has been reclassified to conform to the geographic areas required to be disclosed in 2009 under the revised accounting standard. Adoption of the new rules had no effect on the 2009 consolidated financial statements. The effect of applying the new reserve estimation requirements did not significantly impact 2009 net proved reserve volumes, nor will the requirements have a material impact on depletion expense in future periods.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In June 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the consolidation standard applicable to variable interest entities. The amendments reduce the previously required quantitative consolidation analysis, and require ongoing reassessments of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. This standard requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprises involvement with a variable interest entity. This standard is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after November15, 2009. The adoption of this standard will not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, other than the expanded disclosures.
2. Divestitures and Other Gains (Losses) on Divestitures and Other During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company closed several unrelated property divestiture transactions, realizing proceeds of approximately $176million, $2.5billion, and $11.1billion before income taxes, respectively. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, net gains on divestitures were $44million, $1.2billion, and $4.7billion, respectively. The 2009 gains included $29million primarily related to divestitures of certain oil and gas properties in Qatar.
In December 2009, Anadarko entered into a non-monetary exchange for certain oil and gas properties in the Rockies area. The properties received were recorded at fair value of approximately $230million and the properties conveyed were accounted for as a retirement as the conveyance did not significantly affect the depletion rate of the properties.
During 2008, the Company entered into an agreement to divest its 50% interest in the Peregrino field, offshore Brazil, and certain related assets. The Peregrino divestiture closed in December 2008. Anadarko received approximately $1.4billion in net after-tax cash proceeds from the sale, recognizing a gain of approximately $800million. In connection with the sale of its interest in the Peregrino field, Anadarko may receive contingent consideration in future periods. Contingent consideration is based on the value of oil produced from properties subject to the sale transaction. The Company has not recorded any amounts for this contingent consideration. Additionally, the Company has cash on deposit with the Brazilian federal court pending a decision regarding the appropriate rate of tax on the sale of the Peregrino field.
The 2007 gains included $4.1billion related to the divestiture of certain oil and gas properties and $0.6billion related to the divestiture of certain gathering and processing facilities.
In 2008, gains (losses) on divestitures and other, net included a net $82million ($52million after tax) reduction related to corrections resulting from analysis of property records after the adoption of the successful efforts method of accounting. This net amount included a reduction of $163million related to 2007. Management 78 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 2. Divestitures and Other (Continued) concluded that this misstatement was not material relative to 2007 interim and annual results, or to the 2008 periods, and corrected the error in the first quarter of 2008.
Discontinued Operations In November 2006, Anadarko sold its wholly owned subsidiary, Anadarko Canada Corporation. The results of Anadarkos Canadian operations have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows for 2008 and 2007 primarily related to adjustments to an indemnity obligation provided by the Company to the purchaser, as well as expenses associated with finalizing exit activities. See Note 14.
Severance and Asset-Realignment Expenses During 2007, general and administrative expense included charges of $85million associated with employee severance and benefits arising from the Companys post-acquisition asset-realignment and restructuring efforts initiated in the fourth quarter of 2006. These expenses were not material in 2008 or 2009.
During 2007, oil and gas operating expense included charges of $20million for employee-related severance costs associated with field operations. At December31, 2008, there was no remaining liability.
3. Noncontrolling Interest During the second quarter of 2008, Western Gas Partners, LP (WES) completed its initial public offering of 20.8million common units (representing a 38.4% limited partner interest) for net proceeds of $321million ($343million less $22million for underwriting discounts and structuring fees). WES is a limited partnership formed by Anadarko to own, operate, acquire and develop midstream assets. Anadarko contributed assets to WES in exchange for an aggregate 59.6% initial limited partner interest (consisting of common and subordinated limited partner units) in WES, a 2% general partner interest and incentive distribution rights (IDRs). IDRs entitle the holder to specified increasing percentages of cash distributions as WESs per-unit cash distributions increase. In addition, Anadarko maintains control over the assets owned by WES through ownership of the general partner. Proceeds from the offering were used to reduce debt.
All proceeds from the sale of the common units to the public is reported as noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet, including $29million that will be transferred to paid-in capital if and when the WES subordinated units convert to common units. The results of operations and financial position of WES are included in the consolidated financial statements of Anadarko. The portion of WES results of operations that is attributable to common units held by the public (units not held by Anadarko) is recorded as noncontrolling interests.
In December 2009, WES issued 6.9million common units representing limited partner interests to the public. This offering raised proceeds of approximately $120million and was recorded as noncontrolling interests. Anadarko holds an aggregate 54.8% limited partner interest in WES as of December31, 2009.
4. Inventories The major classes of inventories, which are included in other current assets, are as follows: millions 2009 2008 Crude oil and NGLs $ 142 $ 89 Natural gas 94 51 Total $ 236 $ 140 79 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 5.

This includes $22million related to the oil and gas exploration and production operating segment, which was triggered by the current economic and commodity price environment. In addition, certain midstream operating segment assets were impaired by $7million due to reduced operating activity, and an LNG facility site, included in the marketing operating segment, was impaired by $12million. All assets were impaired to fair value resulting in Level 3 measurements, and, along with current-year depreciation, reduced the net book value to $26million.
During 2008 and 2007, the Company recognized impairments of $211million and $51million, respectively. Impairments in 2008 included $113million associated with United States properties included in the oil and gas exploration and production operating segment, and $98million associated with certain gathering and processing facilities in the United States included in the midstream operating segment. These impairments resulted primarily from lower commodity prices at year-end 2008.
Suspended Exploratory Drilling Costs If an exploratory well provides evidence as to the existence of sufficient quantities of hydrocarbons to justify potential completion as a producing well, drilling costs associated with the well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling. This determination may take longer than one year in certain areas (generally, deepwater and international locations) depending upon, among other things, the amount of hydrocarbons discovered, the outcome of planned geological and engineering studies, the need for additional appraisal drilling activities to determine whether the discovery is sufficient to support an economic development plan and, the requirement for government sanctioning in certain international locations before proceeding with development activities.
At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities  in particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, any associated suspended exploratory drilling costs are expensed in that period.

Properties and Equipment (Continued) The following table presents the amount of suspended exploratory drilling costs relating to continuing operations at December31 for each of the last three years, and changes in those amounts during the years then ended. The table excludes amounts capitalized and subsequently reclassified to proved oil and gas properties or charged to expense in the same year.

The majority of these costs is associated with deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects and is suspended pending the completion of an economic evaluation including, but not limited to, results of additional appraisal drilling, facilities, infrastructure, well-test analysis, additional geological and geophysical data and approval of a development plan. The international projects with costs suspended for longer than one year are primarily suspended pending the results of additional appraisal drilling, which is currently ongoing. Management believes these projects with suspended exploratory drilling costs exhibit sufficient quantities of hydrocarbons to justify potential development and is actively pursuing efforts to assess whether reserves can be attributed to their respective areas. If additional information becomes available that raises substantial doubt as to the economic or operational viability of any of these projects, the associated costs will be expensed at that time.
6. Investments Noncontrolling Mandatorily Redeemable Interests In 2007, Anadarko contributed certain of its oil and gas properties ($1.0billion fair value at date of contribution) and gathering and processing assets ($1.9billion fair value at date of contribution), to newly formed unconsolidated entities in exchange for noncontrolling mandatorily redeemable interests. The common equity of the investee entities is 95% owned by third parties that 81 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 6. Investments (Continued) also maintain operational control over the assets. Distributions to the interest holders, including Anadarko, are payable quarterly. Subsequent to their formation, the investee entities loaned Anadarko an aggregate of $2.9billion. These loans were funded through third-party equity contributions to the investee entities. The Company accounts for its investment in these entities under the equity method of accounting. Anadarko has legal right of setoff and intends to net-settle its obligations under each of the notes payable to the investees and the distributable fair value of its interest in the corresponding investee entity. Accordingly, the investments and the obligations are presented net on the consolidated balance sheet with the excess of the notes payable to investee entities over the aggregate investment carrying amounts included in other long-term liabilitiesother for all periods presented.
The noncontrolling mandatorily redeemable interests entitle Anadarko to a LIBOR-based preferred return on the value of the contributed assets plus a common return consisting of a 5% participation in profits, losses and any residual value of the investee entities. At December31, 2009, the priority return rates applicable to Anadarkos interests were 0.78% for Anadarkos interest in the oil and gas investee entity and 0.70% for Anadarkos interests in gathering and processing investee entities. Anadarkos interest in these entities also provides the Company with limited consent rights with respect to certain matters, such as acquisition and disposition of assets and incurrence of debt. Anadarko may redeem its noncontrolling interests, and the owners of the controlling interests may cause a redemption of Anadarkos interests, in 2022 and thereafter. Anadarkos interests are mandatorily redeemable in 2037.
The notes issued by Anadarko have 35-year terms and variable LIBOR-based interest rates that fluctuate with Anadarkos credit rating. At December31, 2009, the applicable interest rate for all above-described notes was 1.25%. Interest on the notes is due quarterly, while principal is due at maturity, subject to the net-settlement provisions. The notes are equal in seniority to Anadarkos other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness. The note with the oil and gas entity contains a maximum 67% debt-to-capitalization covenant. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay a portion of Anadarkos indebtedness related to its 2006 acquisitions. Anadarko recognized gains of approximately $443million and $300million on the exchange with the oil and gas investee entity and the gathering and processing investee entities, respectively, in 2007.
At December31, 2009, the carrying amount of these investments was $2.8billion, while the carrying amount of notes payable to the investee entities was $2.9billion. Other (income) expense for 2009, 2008 and 2007 included interest expense on the notes payable to the investee entities of $57million, $123million and $102million, respectively, and equity in earnings from Anadarkos investments in the investee entities of $(42)million, $(89)million and $(98)million, respectively.
Midstream Financing Arrangement As further discussed in Note 10, in December 2007, Anadarko and an entity formed by a group of unrelated third-party investors (the Investor) formed Trinity Associates LLC (Trinity). Trinity was initially capitalized with a $100million cash contribution from Anadarko in exchange for ClassA member and managing member interests in Trinity and a $2.2billion cash contribution from the Investor in exchange for a Class B member cumulative preferred interest. Trinity invested $100million in a U.S. Government securities money market fund and loaned $2.2billion to a wholly owned subsidiary of Anadarko, Midstream Holding. The Company used all of the loan proceeds received by Midstream Holding to repay a portion of the Companys indebtedness related to the 2006 acquisitions. See Note 10 for additional information about the Midstream Subsidiary Note Payable to a Related Party.
Through its ClassA member and managing member interests, Anadarko has significant influence over Trinity and accounts for its investment in Trinity under the equity method of accounting. Trinitys earnings, which consist primarily of interest income from the Midstream Holding note and the government money market fund investment, are to be allocated first to the Investors Class B member interest until its cumulative preferred return is satisfied, with the remaining earnings allocated to Anadarkos ClassA member interest. Anadarko 82 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 6. Investments (Continued) absorbs first-dollar losses of Trinity, if any, until its ClassA member capital account in Trinity is reduced to zero. As of December31, 2009, the carrying amount of Anadarkos investment in Trinity was $100million and is included in other assets. Investment earnings are included in other (income) expense and were not material.
Other During the fourth quarter of 2008, Anadarko changed the method of accounting for its investment in Petroritupano, S.A. (Petroritupano), a Venezuelan mixed company, to the cost method. The Company determined that it was no longer appropriate to account for the investment under the equity method. At December31, 2009 and 2008, the Companys investment in Petroritupano is included in other assets.
7. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for 2009 and 2008 are as follows: 2009 2008 millions OilandGas Exploration & Production Midstream Total OilandGas Exploration & Production Midstream Total Balance at beginning of year $ 5,143 $ 139 $ 5,282 $ 4,847 $ 108 $ 4,955 Goodwill associated with 2006 acquisitions    298 31 329 Other changes, net    (2 )  (2 ) Balance at end of year $ 5,143 $ 139 $ 5,282 $ 5,143 $ 139 $ 5,282 During 2008, the carrying amount of goodwill increased $327million largely attributable to revisions in estimates of deferred tax liabilities recorded upon the acquisitions of Kerr-McGee Corporation (Kerr-McGee) and Western Gas Resources, Inc. (Western). None of Anadarkos goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.
Intangible assets subject to amortization at December31, 2009 and 2008 are as follows: millions GrossCarrying Amount Accumulated Amortization NetCarrying Amount Balance at December31, 2009 Drilling contracts $ 155 $ (155 ) $  Transportation contracts 171 (163 ) 8 Offshore platform leases 60 (28 ) 32 $ 386 $ (346 ) $ 40 Balance at December31, 2008 Drilling contracts $ 155 $ (153 ) $ 2 Transportation contracts 171 (76 ) 95 Offshore platform leases 60 (26 ) 34 $ 386 $ (255 ) $ 131 Costs associated with acquired drilling contract intangibles were initially capitalized as intangible assets. Amortization of these costs is recorded to oil and gas properties as exploratory and development drilling costs and ultimately expensed through depletion. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, $2million, $35million and $81million, 83 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 7. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (Continued) respectively, of drilling contract intangible value was amortized and recorded to oil and gas properties. Drilling contract intangibles relate to the Companys oil and gas exploration and production operating segment.
The Company recognized impairments of $74million, $12million and zero for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to certain transportation contracts included in intangible assets due to changes in price differentials at specific locations. These assets were impaired to fair value, determined using a discounted cash flow approach, which incorporates market-based inputs that represent a Level 2 fair-value measurement. Amortization expense for the transportation contracts was $13million, $26million and $28million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The transportation contract impairments and amortization relate to the marketing operating segment.
Costs associated with offshore platform leases were capitalized as intangible assets. Amortization expense for the offshore platform lease intangibles was $2million, $7million and $19million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Offshore platform lease intangibles relate to the Companys oil and gas exploration and production operating segment.
The estimated aggregate amortization expense for all intangible assets for the next five years is $3million, $5million, $6million, $1million, and $1million, respectively.
8. Derivative Instruments Objective and Strategy The Company is exposed to commodity price and interest-rate risk, and management considers it prudent to periodically reduce the Companys exposure to cash flow variability resulting from commodity price changes and interest-rate fluctuations. Accordingly, the Company enters into certain derivative instruments in order to manage its exposure to these risks.
Futures, swaps and options are used to manage the Companys cash flow exposure to commodity price risk inherent in the Companys oil and gas production and gas-processing operations (Oil and Gas Production/Processing Derivative Activities). Futures contracts and commodity swap agreements are used to fix the price of expected future oil and gas sales at major industry trading locations, such as Henry Hub, Louisiana for gas and Cushing, Oklahoma for oil. Basis swaps are used to fix or float the price differential between the product price at one market location versus another. Options are used to establish a floor and a ceiling price (collar) for expected future oil and gas sales. Derivative instruments are also used to manage commodity price risk inherent in customer pricing requirements and to fix margins on the future sale of natural gas and NGLs from the Companys leased storage facilities (Marketing and Trading Derivative Activities).
The Company may also enter into physical-delivery sales contracts to manage cash flow variability. These contracts call for the receipt or delivery of physical product at a specified location and price, which may be fixed or market-based.
Interest-rate swaps are used to fix or float interest rates on existing or anticipated indebtedness. The purpose of these instruments is to mitigate the Companys existing or anticipated exposure to unfavorable interest-rate changes.
The Company does not apply hedge accounting to any of its derivative instruments. The application of hedge accounting was discontinued by the Company for periods beginning on or after January1, 2007. As a result, both realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with derivative instruments are recognized in earnings. Net derivative losses attributable to derivatives previously subject to hedge accounting reside in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to earnings in future periods as the economic transactions to which the derivatives relate are recorded in earnings.
The accumulated other comprehensive loss balances related to commodity derivatives at December31, 2009 and December31, 2008, were $10million ($7million after tax) and $22million ($14million after tax), respectively. The accumulated other comprehensive loss balances related to interest-rate derivatives at 84 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 8. Derivative Instruments (Continued) December31, 2009 and December31, 2008, were $141million ($89million after tax) and $163million ($104million after tax), respectively.

The sold call establishes the maximum price that the Company will receive for the contracted commodity volumes. The purchased put establishes the minimum price that the Company will receive for the contracted volumes unless the market price for the commodity falls below the sold put strike price, at which point the minimum price equals the reference price ( i.e.
, NYMEX) plus the excess of the purchased put strike price over the sold put strike price.
Marketing and Trading Derivative Activities In addition to the positions in the above tables, the Company also engages in marketing and trading activities, which include physical product sales and derivative transactions entered into to reduce commodity price risk associated with certain physical product sales. At December31, 2009 and December31, 2008, the Company had outstanding physical transactions for 46billion cubic feet (Bcf) and 51 Bcf, respectively, offset by derivative transactions for 17 Bcf and 34 Bcf, respectively, for net positions of 29 Bcf and 17 Bcf, respectively.
85 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 8. Derivative Instruments (Continued) Interest-Rate Derivatives As discussed in Note 10, during 2009, Anadarko issued fixed-rate senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2.0billion. In advance of certain of these debt issuances, Anadarko entered into derivative financial instruments, effectively hedging the U.S. Treasury portion of the coupon rate on a portion of this debt. These derivative instruments were settled concurrently with the associated debt issuances, resulting in a realized loss of $16million for the year ended December31, 2009, reflected in (gains) losses on other derivatives, net.
As of December31, 2009, the Company had scheduled debt maturities of approximately $3.5billion in 2011 and 2012. In anticipation of refinancing a portion of these maturing debt obligations, in December 2008 and January 2009 Anadarko entered into interest-rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of the fixed interest rate it would pay on an aggregate notional principal amount of $3.0billion, over a reference term of either 10 years or 30 years, beginning in 2011 and 2012. The swap instruments include a provision that requires both the termination of the swaps and cash settlement in full at the start of the reference period. A summary of the swaps detailing the outstanding notional principal amounts and the associated reference periods is shown in the table below.
Increases in the reference U.S. Treasury rates since contract inception have increased the value of this swap portfolio to Anadarko, the fixed-rate payor. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company revised the contractual terms of this swap portfolio to increase the weighted-average interest rate it is required to pay from approximately 3.25% to approximately 4.80%, and realized $552million in cash. This realized gain was recorded to (gains) losses on other derivatives, net, as were unrealized gains of $57million, for the year ended December31, 2009, which were attributable to further fair-value changes of the Companys swap portfolio.
The Companys interest-rate derivative positions outstanding as of December31, 2009, are as follows: millions Reference Period Weighted-Average Interest Rate Notional Principal Amount: Start End $750 October2011 October2021 4.72 % $1,250 October 2011 October2041 4.83 % $250 October 2012 October2022 4.91 % $750 October 2012 October2042 4.80 % 86 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 8.

Derivative Instruments (Continued) to counterparty credit risk. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of each of its counterparties, establishes credit limits according to the Companys credit policies and guidelines, and assesses the impact, if any, of counterparties creditworthiness on fair value. The Company has the ability to require cash collateral or letters of credit to mitigate credit-risk exposure. The Company also routinely exercises its contractual right to net realized gains against realized losses when settling with its counterparties.
The Companys net asset derivatives recorded at fair value on the balance sheet include amounts attributable to agreements entered into with financial institutions. Approximately $442million of the Companys $495million gross derivative asset balance at December31, 2009 was attributable to open positions with financial institutions. The Company has netting and setoff agreements with each of these counterparties, which permit the net settlement of these gross derivative assets against gross derivative liabilities with this same group of counterparties. As of December31, 2009, $321million of the Companys $541million gross derivative liability balance is permitted to offset the gross derivative asset balance. The table below includes the financial impact of our netting arrangements on the fair value of the Companys outstanding derivative positions.
Certain of the Companys derivative instruments contain provisions requiring either full or partial collateralization of the Companys obligations, or the immediate settlement of all such obligations in the event of a downgrade in the Companys credit rating to a level below investment grade from major credit rating agencies. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features for which a net liability position existed on December31, 2009 was $146million. This amount represents the amount that the Company would have to either collateralize or cash settle in the event the Companys credit rating was downgraded to a level below investment grade and the credit-risk-related features of such instruments were exercised.
Fair Value The fair value of commodity-futures contracts are based on inputs that are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, resulting in Level 1 categorization of such measurements. The valuation of physical-delivery purchase and sale agreements, over-the-counter financial swaps and three-way collars are based on similar transactions observable in active markets or industry-standard models that primarily rely on market-observable inputs. Substantially all of the assumptions for industry-standard models are observable in active markets throughout the full term of the instrument. Therefore, the Company categorizes these measurements as Level 2.
The following tables set forth, by level within the fair-value hierarchy, the fair value of the Companys financial assets and liabilities.

Fair values are based on quoted market prices or average valuations of similar debt instruments at the balance sheet date for those debt instruments for which quoted market prices are not available.
Except for Anadarkos Midstream Subsidiary Note Payable to a Related Party (see following discussion), none of the Companys notes, debentures or credit agreements contain credit-rating-downgrade triggers that result in accelerating debt maturity. All of the Companys debt, with the exception of the WES credit facility, is senior unsecured debt of the Company. As of December31, 2009, the Company had approximately $340million in undrawn letters of credit.

Debt and Interest Expense (Continued) In October 2006, the Company received $500million of proceeds from a private offering of Zero-Coupon Senior Notes due 2036 with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of $2.4billion. The Company presents the note in long-term debt. The carrying amount as of December31, 2009 includes $30million, $28million and $28million related to accretion expense recognized in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The notes were issued with a yield to maturity of 5.24%, and the holder has an option to put the notes back to the Company annually, starting in 2010, at the accreted value, which approximates carrying value. If the put option is exercised in 2010, the Company intends to refinance the debt under its Revolving Credit Agreement (RCA).
Midstream Subsidiary Note Payable to a Related Party In December 2007, Anadarko and the Investor formed Trinity, with initial capitalization totaling $2.3billion. Note 6 provides additional information regarding Anadarkos interest in Trinity. Trinity extended a $2.2billion loan to a wholly owned subsidiary of Anadarko, referred to herein as Midstream Holding, which holds and operates substantially all of Anadarkos midstream assets, directly and through its subsidiaries. The Company used all of the loan proceeds received by Midstream Holding to repay a portion of the Companys indebtedness related to the 2006 acquisitions.
The principal balance owed by Midstream Holding to Trinity is reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as Midstream Subsidiary Note Payable to a Related Party. The loan has an initial maturity date of December27, 2012, subject to renewals for additional five-year periods on market terms at the time of renewal. Interest on the loan is based on three-month LIBOR plus a margin. The rate in effect at the beginning of 2010 is 1.32%.
Midstream Holding may repay the loan in whole or in part at any time prior to maturity. In December 2008, Anadarko provided a parental guaranty for the payment of principal and interest on the remaining balance of the Midstream Subsidiary Note Payable to a Related Party in exchange for the removal of various covenants in the loan agreement, including a ceiling on the maximum ratio of debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as defined in the loan agreement. Midstream Holding was in compliance with all previously existing covenants as of the date the Anadarko parental guaranty was provided. The amended loan agreement requires customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, and includes the same financial covenants as the RCA discussed below. The Midstream Subsidiary Note Payable to a Related Party has the same priority with respect to the payment of principal and interest as Anadarkos other debt.
Following a sale or transfer of assets to third parties or other entities within the Anadarko consolidated group, Midstream Holding and/or its subsidiaries will be required to repay a portion of the loan principal. Further, maturity of the loan could be accelerated if Anadarkos senior unsecured credit rating were to be rated below BB- by Standard and Poors (S&P) or Ba3 by Moodys Investors Service (Moodys). As of December31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all covenants, and S&P and Moodys rated the Companys debt at BBB- and Baa3, respectively.
Anadarko Revolving Credit Agreement In March 2008, the Company entered into a $1.3billion, five-year RCA with a syndicate of United States and foreign lenders. Under the terms of the RCA, the Company can, under certain conditions, request an increase in the borrowing capacity under the RCA up to a total available credit amount of $2.0billion. The RCA has a maximum 65% debt-to-capitalization covenant. The RCA terminates in March 2013. As of December31, 2009, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the RCA. Anadarko was in compliance with existing covenants and the full amount of the RCA was available for borrowing at December31, 2009.
WES Revolving Credit Facility In October 2009, Anadarkos consolidated subsidiary, WES, entered into a three-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF) with a group of banks. The aggregate initial commitments of the lenders under the RCF are $350million and are expandable to a maximum of $450million.
92 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 10. Debt and Interest Expense (Continued) The RCF matures in October 2012. The RCF contains various customary covenants including a limitation on debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and a minimum interest coverage requirement. As of December31, 2009, WES had no outstanding borrowings under the RCF. WES was in compliance with existing covenants at December31, 2009.

See Note 6 for interest expense incurred on certain notes payable to unconsolidated affiliates which is reported in other (income) expense.
11. Stockholders Equity Common Stock In August 2008, the Company announced a $5billion share-repurchase program under which shares may be repurchased either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The program is authorized to extend through August 2011 and replaced the $1billion stock-buyback program authorized in 2005. The repurchase program does not obligate Anadarko to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time. During 2008, Anadarko purchased 10million shares of common stock for $600million under the program through purchases in the open market and under share-repurchase agreements. During 2009 and 2007, no shares were repurchased under the programs in effect at those times.
In May 2009, Anadarko completed a public offering of 30million shares of common stock at $45.50 per share. After deducting the underwriting discount and other offering costs of $28million, net proceeds to the Company were approximately $1.3billion. Net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures.

For all periods presented, quarterly dividends of nine cents per share were paid to holders of common stock. As of December31, 2009, the covenants contained in certain of the Companys credit and lease agreements provided for a maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio of 65%. The covenants do not specifically restrict the payment of dividends; however, the impact of dividends paid on the Companys debt-to-capitalization ratio must be considered in order to ensure covenant compliance. Based on these covenants, as of December31, 2009, retained earnings of approximately $13.3billion were not limited as to the payment of dividends.

Stockholders Equity (Continued) The reconciliation between basic and diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders is as follows: millions except per share amounts 2009 2008 2007 Income: Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders $ (135 ) $ 3,197 $ 3,767 Less: Distributions to participating securities  2 2 Less: Undistributed income allocated to participating securities  37 40 Basic $ (135 ) $ 3,158 $ 3,725 Diluted $ (135 ) $ 3,158 $ 3,725 Shares: Basic Weighted-average common shares outstanding 480 465 465 Dilutive effect of stock options and performance-based stock awards  1 2 Diluted 480 466 467 Income (loss) per common share: Basic $ (0.28 ) $ 6.79 $ 8.01 Diluted $ (0.28 ) $ 6.78 $ 7.99 All prior-period EPS data presented above have been adjusted retrospectively to conform to the requirements of a new accounting standard, which addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions constitute participating securities. For 2009, basic EPS was not impacted by the two-class method because the Companys participating securities are not obligated to share in the losses of the Company, and diluted EPS was not impacted because the inclusion of these securities would have had an anti-dilutive effect. Basic and diluted EPS, as previously reported, decreased $0.08 and $0.06, respectively, in 2008 and decreased $0.08 and $0.06, respectively, in 2007 under the two-class method.
For 2009, 2008 and 2007, awards for 14.2million, 7.6million and 6.6million average shares, respectively, of common stock were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation because the inclusion of these shares would have had an anti-dilutive effect.
See Note 12 for information related to common stock issued under stock-based compensation plans.
Preferred Stock In the second quarter of 2008, Anadarko redeemed and subsequently retired its 5.46% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock for $45million. Holders of the shares were entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of $5.46 per share.
Dividends of $27.30 per share for 2008 and $54.60 per share for 2007 (equivalent to $2.73 and $5.46, respectively, per Depositary Share) were paid to holders of preferred stock.

Stock-Based Compensation The Company generally issues new shares to satisfy employee share-based payment plans. At December31, 2009, 24million shares of the 35million shares of Anadarko common stock originally authorized for awards under the active share-based compensation plans remain available for future issuance. The number of shares available is reduced by awards granted. A summary of stock-based compensation cost is presented below: millions 2009 2008 2007 Compensation cost: Restricted stock $ 138 $ 131 $ 115 Value Creation Plan and other 171 43 55 Total compensation cost, pretax 309 174 170 Income tax benefit 112 63 62 For 2009, 2008 and 2007, $12.3million, $9.4million and $23.4million, respectively, in excess tax benefits were included in cash flow from financing activities. Cash received from stock option exercises for 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $22.3million, $14.1million and $88.7million, respectively.
Equity-Classified Awards Stock Options Certain employees may be granted options to purchase shares of Anadarko common stock with an exercise price equal to, or greater than, the fair market value of Anadarko common stock on the date of grant. These stock options vest over service periods ranging from three to four years and will terminate at the earlier of seven years from the date of grant or the date of exercise.
Nonemployee directors may be granted nonqualified stock options with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of Anadarko common stock on the date of grant. These stock options vest over a one-year service period from the date of grant and terminate at the earlier of ten years from the date of grant or the date of exercise.
The fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The expected life of the option is estimated based upon historical exercise behavior. The expected forfeiture rate is estimated based upon historical forfeiture experience. The volatility assumption was estimated based upon expectations of volatility over the life of the option as measured by historical and implied volatility. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury rate for a term commensurate with the expected life of the option. The dividend yield was based upon a 12-month average dividend yield. The Company used the following weighted-average assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock options granted during 2009, 2008 and 2007.

The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $24.3million, $12.5million and $78.9million, respectively, based on the difference between the market price at the exercise date and the option price. As of December31, 2009, there was $64.2million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.
Restricted Stock Certain employees may be granted restricted stock in the form of restricted stock awards or restricted stock units. Restricted stock is subject to forfeiture restrictions and cannot be sold, transferred or disposed of during the restriction period. The holders of restricted stock awards have the same rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to such shares, including the right to vote and receive dividends or other distributions paid with respect to the shares. A restricted stock unit is equivalent to a restricted stock award except that unit holders receive cash dividend equivalents during the restriction period and do not have the right to vote the units. Restricted stock vests over service periods ranging from the date of grant up to four years and is not considered issued and outstanding until it vests.
Nonemployee directors are granted deferred shares that are held in a grantor trust by the Company and become payable when the director ceases to serve on the Board of Directors.
A summary of restricted stock activity for the year ended December31, 2009 is presented below: Shares (millions) Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Nonvested at January 1, 2009 4.76 $ 56.01 Granted 1.65 $ 40.65 Vested (2.50 ) $ 53.74 Forfeited (0.08 ) $ 51.28 Nonvested at December 31, 2009 3.83 $ 50.98 97 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 12. Stock-Based Compensation (Continued) The weighted-average grant-date fair value of restricted stock granted during 2008 and 2007 was $61.20 and $52.53, respectively. The total fair value of restricted shares vested during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $122.0million, $110.3million and $119.1million, respectively, based on the market price at the vesting date. As of December31, 2009, there was $126.2million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years.
Performance-Based Share Awards Key officers of the Company were provided Performance Unit Award Agreements in 2004, 2005 and 2006 with three-year performance periods ending December 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. The number of shares of common stock to be issued was determined based on a market objective and a performance objective, with both objectives equally weighted. The number of shares of common stock to be issued with respect to the market objective was determined by comparing the Companys total shareholder return to the total shareholder return of a predetermined group of peer companies over the performance period. The number of shares of common stock to be issued with respect to the performance objective was determined based on the Companys return on capital over the performance period. The fair value per share for the performance-based objective is $31.54, $47.14 and $49.86 for the agreements related to the three-year periods ending December 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation (Continued) In November 2007, in place of the cancelled awards, two new Performance Unit Award Agreements were provided to key officers. The number of shares of common stock awarded under these agreements is based solely on a comparison of the Companys total shareholder return to the total shareholder return of a predetermined group of peer companies over performance periods ranging from one to three years. The table below summarizes these awards: Year Granted AwardType Maximum Shares of CommonStock PerformancePeriod Sharesof Common StockIssued Year Issued 2007 Transitional (1) 184,512 1.1.2008-12.31.2008 6,162 (2) 2008 184,512 1.1.2008 -12.31.2009 7,719 (2) 2009 128,505 (3) 2010 Annual 282,700 1.1.2008 -12.31.2009 5,700 (2) 2008 125,706 (3) 2010 282,700 1.1.2008 -12.31.2010 29,100 (2) 2009 (1) Recognized incremental compensation cost of $7million attributable to the modification of the cancelled awards.
(2) No shares of common stock were issued to current key officers. Shares shown as issued reflect shares issued to certain key officers whose employment with the Company terminated prior to the end of the performance period and the determination of actual performance.
(3) During 2010, 336,865 shares were awarded to current key officers for the performance periods that ended December 2009.
As of December31, 2009, there was $2.6million of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to performance-based share awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of one year.
Liability-Classified Awards Value Creation Plan As a part of its employee compensation program, the Company offers an incentive compensation program that generally provides non-officer employees the opportunity to earn cash bonus awards based on the Companys total shareholder return for the year, compared to the total shareholder return of a predetermined group of peer companies. As of December31, 2009, the Company has accrued approximately $105million for the 2009 performance period.
Performance-Based Unit Awards In November 2008 and 2009, key officers of the Company were provided Performance Unit Award Agreements with a two-year performance period ending December31, 2010 and 2011, respectively, and a three-year performance period ending December31, 2011 and 2012, respectively. The vesting of these units is based solely on comparing the Companys total shareholder return to the total shareholder return of a predetermined group of peer companies over the specified performance period. Each performance unit represents the value of one share of the Companys common stock. At the end of each performance period, the value of the vested performance units, if any, will be paid in cash. As of December31, 2009, the liability under Performance Unit Award Agreements was $16.7million, and there was $38.4million of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to these awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years.
99 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 13. Commitments Leases The Company has $2.5billion in long-term drilling rig commitments that satisfy operating lease criteria. The Company also has various commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements of $0.9billion for production platforms and equipment, buildings, facilities and aircraft. These operating leases expire at various dates through 2024. Certain of these operating leases contain residual value guarantees at the end of the lease term; however, at December31, 2009, no material liabilities were accrued for these guarantees. At December31, 2009, future minimum lease payments under existing operating leases are as follows: millions Operating Leases 2010 $ 971 2011 872 2012 776 2013 383 2014 95 Later years 296 Total future minimum lease payments $ 3,393 Total rent expense, net of sublease income, amounted to $188million in 2009, $226million in 2008 and $229million in 2007. Total rent expense includes contingent rent expense related to processing fees of $39million, $32million and $6million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Drilling Rig Commitments Anadarko has entered into various agreements to secure a portion of the drilling rigs necessary to execute its drilling plans over the next several years. The table of future minimum lease payments above includes approximately $2.3billion related to 5 offshore drilling vessels and $186million related to certain contracts for onshore United States drilling rigs. The portion of these lease payments associated with exploratory wells and development wells, net of amounts billed to partners, will initially be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties, and either depreciated in future periods or written off as exploration expense.
Production Platforms During 2004, Anadarko and a group of energy companies (Atwater Valley Producers Group) executed agreements with third parties for the dedication, processing and gathering of natural-gas and condensate production from several natural-gas fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Third parties constructed and own Independence Hub, a semi-submersible platform in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Anadarko became operator of the platform structure upon mechanical completion in 2007.
The table of future minimum lease payments above includes $72million related to the monthly demand charges due under the above-described agreements. The agreements do not contain any purchase options, purchase obligations or value guarantees.
Spar Platform and Production Vessel Leases Anadarko has operating leases related to certain spar platforms in the Gulf of Mexico and a floating production, storage and offloading vessel in China. The table of future minimum lease payments above includes approximately $450million for these agreements. These agreements also contain residual value guarantees totaling $37million at the end of the lease periods.
Buildings The table of future minimum lease payments above includes the Companys lease payment obligations of $99million related to office building leases, including the corporate office building located in Denver, Colorado. In December 2009, the Company exercised its purchase option under a lease covering two 100 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 13. Commitments (Continued) corporate office buildings in The Woodlands, Texas (The Woodlands lease). The Woodlands lease contained various covenants including covenants regarding the Companys financial condition. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at the time it exercised its purchase option.
Aircraft The table of future minimum lease payments above includes the Companys lease payment obligations of $11million related to aircraft leases. Some of these leases provide for a residual value guarantee for any deficiency resulting from a sale of aircraft for less than the sale option amount (approximately $31million in the aggregate). In addition, the Company is entitled to any proceeds from a sale of an aircraft in excess of the sale option amount.
Other Equipment Leases Included in the table of future minimum lease payments above are lease payments of approximately $243million related to equipment associated with various gas gathering and processing systems. In the event the Company does not purchase the equipment at the end of the leases, the Company may be required to make payments in connection with residual value guarantees for a total of up to $54million.
Other Commitments In the normal course of business, the Company enters into other contractual agreements to purchase natural gas or crude oil, pipeline capacity, storage capacity, utilities and other services. Aggregate future payments under these contracts total $4.3billion, of which $1.6billion is expected to be paid in 2010, $890million in 2011, $560million in 2012, $311million in 2013, $154million in 2014 and $705million thereafter.
The Company is obligated for approximately 27% of the construction costs of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO) that will be used in the Companys Ghana operations. Construction of the FPSO is expected to be complete in the first half of 2010, and the Companys share of total construction costs is estimated to be approximately $224million. At December31, 2009, the Company has accrued a net liability of $129million representing Anadarkos net share of construction costs incurred to date, less amounts funded by Anadarko through loans and other payments to the contractor of approximately $60million. The Companys obligation for construction costs is reported net of amounts previously funded as Anadarko has a contractual right to offset collection of the loans made by Anadarko against the Companys construction cost obligation.
Sale of Future Hard Minerals Royalty Revenues In 2004, the Company conveyed a limited-term non-participating royalty interest, which was carved out of the Companys existing royalty interests, that entitles a third party to receive future coal and trona royalty revenue over an 11-year period. Additionally, the third party is entitled to receive 5% of the aggregate royalties earned during the first ten years of the agreement that exceed $400million. The specified cumulative future amount that the third-party investor expects to receive, prior to the 5% of any excess royalties described above, is $100million. This amount and the payment timing are subject to change based upon the actual royalties received by the Company during the term of the agreement. The third party relies solely on royalty payments to recover its investment; therefore, the third party bears the risk associated with the royalties being insufficient to recover the original investment over the term of the agreement.
Proceeds from this transaction were accounted for as deferred revenues and classified as liabilities on the balance sheet. The deferred revenues are amortized to other sales on a unit-of-revenue basis over the term of the agreement. For each of the years 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company amortized $16million of deferred revenues to other sales revenues related to this agreement.
101 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 14. Contingencies General Litigation charges of $24million, $112million and $56million were expensed during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits and is involved in governmental proceedings, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims and environmental claims. The Company has also been named as a defendant in various personal injury claims, including claims by employees of third-party contractors alleging exposure to asbestos, silica and benzene while working at refineries (previously owned by predecessors of acquired companies) located in Texas, California and Oklahoma. While the ultimate outcome and impact on the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.
Litigation The Company is subject to various claims from its royalty owners in the regular course of business as an oil and gas producer, including disputes regarding measurement, post-production costs and expenses and royalty valuations. The Company was named as a defendant in a case styled U.S. of America ex rel. Harold E. Wright v. AGIP Company, et al . filed in September 2000 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Lufkin Division. Kerr-McGee was also named as a defendant in this legal proceeding. This lawsuit generally alleges that the Company, including Kerr-McGee, and other industry defendants knowingly undervalued natural gas in connection with royalty payments on production from federal and Indian lands. Based on the Companys present understanding of these various governmental and False Claims Act proceedings, the Company believes that it has substantial defenses to these claims and is vigorously asserting such defenses. However, if the Company is found to have violated the False Claims Act, the Company could be subject to a variety of damages, including treble damages and substantial monetary fines. The discovery process is ongoing. The court has entered an order whereby the case will be tried in phases. The claims against the Company have yet to be set for trial. The Company is currently in settlement discussions with the U.S. government in efforts to globally resolve this litigation against Anadarko and Kerr-McGee, as well as any related administrative actions. Management has accrued a liability for only the settlement amount. The Company believes that an additional loss is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on Anadarkos consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Deepwater Royalty Relief Act In 1995, the United States Congress passed the Deepwater Royalty Relief Act (DWRRA) to stimulate exploration and production of oil and natural gas by providing relief from the obligation to pay royalties on certain federal leases located in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The Company currently owns interests in several deepwater Gulf of Mexico leases granted during the 1996-2000 time period (some originally owned by Kerr-McGee). After the passage of the DWRRA, the Minerals Management Service (MMS), an agency of the Department of the Interior (DOI), inserted price thresholds into leases issued in 1996, 1997 and 2000 that effectively eliminated the DWRRA royalty relief if these price thresholds were exceeded. The Companys 1998 and 1999 leases did not contain price-threshold provisions.
In January 2006, the DOI issued an order (the 2006 Order) to Kerr-McGee Oil and Gas Corporation (KMOG), a subsidiary of Kerr-McGee, to pay oil and gas royalties and accrued interest on KMOGs deepwater Gulf of Mexico production associated with eight 1996, 1997 and 2000 leases, for which KMOG considered royalties to be suspended under the DWRRA. On March17, 2006, KMOG filed a lawsuit styled Kerr-McGee Oil and Gas Corp.v. C. Stephen Allred, Assistant Secretary for Land& Minerals Mgt. and the Dept of the Interior (Kerr-McGee v. Allred) in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana against the DOI for injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to the DOIs claims for additional royalties on the eight leases listed in the 2006 Order. In May 2007, KMOG filed a motion for summary judgment with the District Court for the Western District of Louisiana which ruled in favor of KMOG in October 2007. The DOI appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Fifth Circuit). In January 2009, a three-judge Fifth Circuit panel unanimously affirmed the District Courts ruling in favor of KMOG. At the end of March 2009, the DOI filed a petition for rehearing by the full Fifth Circuit (en banc) which was denied on April14, 2009. The DOI filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court which was denied on October5, 2009.
102 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 14. Contingencies (Continued) The MMS issued two additional orders to Anadarko in 2008 and 2009 to pay past-due royalties and interest covering several deepwater Gulf of Mexico leases, including certain leases contained in the 2006 Order. Generally, the orders issued in 2008 and 2009 cover time periods not included in the 2006 Order. Anadarko has filed administrative appeals of the 2008 and 2009 orders with the MMS and the appeals are currently stayed pending a final non-appealable judgment of Kerr-McGee v. Allred . The MMS has approved Anadarkos request to self-bond the appeal of the order issued in 2008 in lieu of filing a letter of credit or other surety instrument. Anadarko is awaiting a response from the MMS on its request to self-bond the appeal of the 2009 order.
Based on the U.S. Supreme Courts denial of the DOIs petition for review by the court, Anadarko reversed its $657million accrued liability for royalties in September 2009 that could be owed on leases listed in the 2006 Order, similar orders to pay issued in 2008 and 2009, and other deepwater Gulf of Mexico leases with similar price-threshold provisions. The Companys accrued liability of $657million related to royalties on production from January 2003 through September 2009, including a $165million liability related to pre-acquisition contingencies recorded in purchase accounting. In addition, the Company reversed its $78million accrued liability for interest on these unpaid royalty amounts, substantially all of which related to post-acquisition periods.
Guarantees and Indemnifications Under the terms of the Master Separation Agreement entered into between Kerr-McGee and Tronox Incorporated (Tronox), a former wholly owned subsidiary that held Kerr-McGees chemical business, Kerr-McGee agreed to reimburse Tronox for 50% of certain qualifying environmental-remediation costs incurred and paid by Tronox and its subsidiaries before November28, 2012, subject to certain limitations and conditions. The reimbursement obligation is limited to a maximum aggregate reimbursement of $100million. As of December31, 2009, the Company has a $95million liability recorded for the guarantee obligation.
The Company is guarantor for specific financial obligations of a trona mining affiliate. The investment in this entity is accounted for under the equity method. The Company has guaranteed a portion of amounts due under a term loan. The Companys guarantee under the term loan expires in 2010, coinciding with the maturity of that agreement. The Company would be obligated to pay $15million under the term loan if the affiliate defaulted on the obligation. No liability has been recorded for this guarantee as of December31, 2009.
In connection with its various acquisitions, the Company routinely indemnifies the former officers and directors of acquired companies in respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the effective date of the acquisition. The Company also agrees to maintain directors and officers liability insurance on these individuals with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the acquisition, generally for a period of six years. No liability has been recognized for these indemnifications.
The Company also provides certain indemnifications in relation to dispositions of assets. These indemnifications typically relate to disputes, litigation or tax matters existing at the date of disposition. In connection with the 2006 sale of its Canadian subsidiary, the Company indemnified the purchaser for potential future audit adjustments that may be imposed by the Canadian taxing authorities for tax years prior to the sale. During 2008, the purchaser notified Anadarko that $90million of the indemnity is no longer relevant as a result of the effective settlement of the underlying contingent obligation. Accordingly, the Company reversed a portion of its recorded liability. At December31, 2009, other long-term liabilities included a $49million liability for this contingency. The Company believes it is probable that the remaining indemnification will be settled with the purchaser in cash.
Other The Company is subject to other legal proceedings, claims and liabilities which arise in the ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of Anadarko, the liability (if any) with respect to these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Anadarko is also subject to various environmental-remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state and local laws and regulations. As of December31, 2009, the Companys balance sheet included a $96million liability for remediation and reclamation obligations. The Company continually monitors the remediation and reclamation process and the liability recorded.
103 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 15. Other Taxes Taxes incurred, other than income taxes, are as follows: 2009 2008 2007 Production and severance $ 523 $ 1,135 $ 998 Ad valorem 189 221 178 Other 34 96 58 Total $ 746 $ 1,452 $ 1,234 In July 2006, the Algerian parliament approved legislation establishing an exceptional profits tax on foreign companies Algerian oil production. In December 2006, implementing regulations regarding this legislation were issued. These regulations provide for an exceptional profits tax imposed on gross production at rates of taxation ranging from 5% to 50% based on average daily production volumes for each calendar month in which the price of Brent crude averages over $30 per barrel, retroactively effective to August-2006 production. Uncertainty existed at that time as to whether the exceptional profits tax would apply to the full value of production or only to the value of production in excess of $30 per barrel. In 2006, Anadarko recorded a $103million accrual for the tax, assuming the tax would be applied only to the amounts in excess of $30 per barrel.
In January 2007, Sonatrach, the national oil and gas company of Algeria, advised Anadarko that it would begin collecting the exceptional profits tax from Anadarkos share of production commencing with March 2007 liftings, including for the prior months since the new tax went into effect. In April 2007, ALNAFT, an agency under the control of the Algerian Ministry of Energy and Mines responsible for overseeing the Algerian hydrocarbons industry, issued the Application Procedure further defining the procedure and conditions under which the exceptional profits tax is applied and the methodology for its calculation. The Application Procedure and other information supplied by Sonatrach revealed that the exceptional profits tax applied to the full value of production rather than to the amounts in excess of $30 per barrel. This was evidenced by changes in the Companys crude-oil lifting schedule, which was conveyed to Anadarko by Sonatrach. As a result, Anadarko changed the measurement basis for the exceptional profits tax liability in the first quarter of 2007 to reflect the application of the tax rate to the full value of production. On that measurement basis, the Company recognized production tax expense of $379million, $648million and $705million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of the 2007 amount, $87million, or $0.19 per diluted share, was related to 2006 sales and income from continuing operations.
In response to the Algerian governments imposition of the exceptional profits tax, the Company has notified Sonatrach of its disagreement with the collection of the exceptional profits tax, based on the Companys interpretation of the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA), which provides for fiscal stability through several provisions that require Sonatrach to pay all taxes and royalties. To facilitate discussions between the parties in an effort to resolve the dispute, on October31, 2007, the Company initiated a conciliation proceeding on the exceptional profits tax as provided in the PSA. Any recommendation issued by a conciliation board (Conciliation Board) arising out of the conciliation proceeding is non-binding on the parties. The Conciliation Board issued its non-binding recommendation on November26, 2008, which the Company received on December1, 2008. On February15, 2009, the Company initiated arbitration against Sonatrach with regard to the exceptional profits tax. In conformance with the terms of the PSA, a notice of arbitration was submitted to Sonatrach.

Income Taxes (Continued) Certain tax effects have been recorded directly to the balance sheet at December31, 2009 and 2008. Tax effects related to internal restructuring of certain foreign operations in prior years have been recorded to other long-term liabilities and are being recognized in the income statement over the estimated life of the related properties. During 2008 and 2007, liabilities of $47million and $184million, respectively, were recorded to other long-term liabilities. During 2009, $51million of the liabilities recorded in prior years were reversed to income. As of December31, 2009, the balance in other long-term liabilities related to the restructuring of certain foreign operations was $93million. This balance will be recognized into tax expense in future periods.
Additionally, the Company recorded increases in tax liabilities of approximately $310million and $16million for 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to certain acquired subsidiaries for years prior to their acquisition by the Company. The increased tax liabilities were due to completion of audits and administrative appeals, filing amended returns, re-evaluation of contingencies, re-establishment of deferred income tax liabilities related to prior acquisitions and changes to the tax basis of acquired assets and liabilities. Accordingly, these liabilities were recorded with an offsetting increase in goodwill.

18. Major Customers The Companys natural gas is sold to interstate and intrastate gas pipelines, direct end-users, industrial users, local distribution companies and gas marketers. Crude oil and condensate are sold to marketers, gatherers and refiners. NGLs are sold to direct end-users, refiners and marketers. These purchasers are located in the United States and China. The majority of the Companys receivables are paid within two months following the month of purchase.
The Company conducts credit analyses of customers prior to making any sales to new customers or increasing credit for existing customers. Based upon these analyses, the Company may require a standby letter of credit or a financial guarantee. As of December31, 2009 and 2008, accounts receivable are shown net of allowance for uncollectible accounts of $11million and $24million, respectively.
In 2009, 2008 and 2007, there were no sales to individual customers that exceeded 10% of the Companys total sales revenues.
108 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 19. Segment Information Anadarkos primary business segments are vertically integrated within the oil and gas industry. These segments are separately managed because of the nature of their products and services, as well as unique technology, distribution and marketing requirements. The Companys three reportable operating segments are oil and gas exploration and production, midstream, and marketing. The exploration and production segment explores for and produces natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs. The midstream segment engages in gathering, processing, treating and transporting Anadarko and third-party oil and gas production. The marketing segment sells most of Anadarkos production, as well as production purchased from third parties.
To assess the operating results of Anadarkos segments, the chief operating decision maker (CODM) analyzes income from continuing operations before income taxes, interest expense, exploration expense, DD&A and impairments less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (Adjusted EBITDAX). Anadarkos definition of Adjusted EBITDAX excludes exploration expense, as exploration expense is not an indicator of operating efficiency for a given reporting period, but is monitored by management as part of costs incurred in exploration and development activities. Similarly, DD&A expense and impairments are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX as a measure of segment operating performance, because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. The Companys definition of Adjusted EBITDAX also excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating results without regard to Anadarkos financing methods or capital structure. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX provides information useful in assessing the Companys financial condition and results of operations and that Adjusted EBITDAX is a widely accepted financial indicator of a companys ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions to stockholders.
Adjusted EBITDAX may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDAX should be considered in conjunction with income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders and other performance measures, such as operating income or cash flow from operating activities. Below is a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes.

However, Anadarko accounts for such intersegment arrangements as executory contracts. Additionally, intersegment asset transfers are accounted for at historical cost basis, and do not give rise to gain or loss recognition.

Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits and Employee Savings Plans Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits The Company has non-contributory defined-benefit pension plans, including both qualified and supplemental plans, and a foreign contributory defined-benefit pension plan. The Company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. Retiree health care benefits are funded by contributions from the Company and the retiree. The Companys retiree life insurance plan is noncontributory.
In 2009, the Company made contributions of $144million to its funded pension plans, $19million to its unfunded pension plans and $16million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. Although reported benefit obligations exceed the fair value of pension and other postretirement plan assets at December31, 2009, the Company monitors the funded status of its funded pension and other postretirement benefit plans to ensure that plan funds are sufficient to continue paying benefits. Contributions to the funded plans increase the plan assets while contributions to unfunded plans are used for current benefit payments. The Company expects to contribute up to $114million to its funded pension plans in 2010. In addition, the Company expects to contribute $19million to its unfunded pension plans and $19million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans in2010.

Following are the weighted-average assumptions used by the Company in determining the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of December31, 2009 and 2008: PensionBenefits OtherBenefits percent 2009 2008 2009 2008 Discount rate 5.25 % 6.00 % 5.50 % 6.00 % Rates of increase in compensation levels 5.00 % 5.00 % n/a n/a The discount-rate assumption used by the Company is meant to reflect the interest rate at which the pension and other postretirement obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date. The Company currently uses a yield curve analysis to support the discount-rate assumption for the plans. This analysis involves the creation of a hypothetical Aa spot yield curve represented by a series of high-quality, non-callable, marketable bonds, then discounts the projected cash flows from each plan at interest rates on the created curve specifically applicable to the timing of each respective cash flow. The present values of the cash flows are then accumulated, and a weighted-average discount rate is calculated by imputing the single discount rate that equates 114 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 20. Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits and Employee Savings Plans (Continued) to the total present value of the cash flows. The consolidated discount-rate assumption is determined by evaluating the weighted-average discount rates determined for each of the Companys significant pension and postretirement plans.
Following are the weighted-average assumptions used by the Company in determining the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost for 2009, 2008 and 2007: Pension Benefits Other Benefits percent 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Discount rate 6.00 % 6.00 % 5.75 % 6.00 % 6.00 % 5.75 % Long-term rate of return on plan assets 7.50 % 7.75 % 7.75 % n/a n/a n/a Rates of increase in compensation levels 5.00 % 5.00 % 5.00 % n/a n/a 5.00 % Plan Assets Investment Policies and Strategies The Company has adopted a balanced, diversified investment strategy, with the intent of maximizing returns without exposure to undue risk. Investments are typically made through investment managers across several investment categories (Domestic Large and Small Cap, International, Domestic Fixed Income, Real Estate, Hedge Funds and Private Equity), with selective exposure to Growth/Value investment styles. Performance for each investment is measured relative to the appropriate index benchmark for its category. Target asset-allocation percentages by major category are 45%-55% equity securities, 20%-30% fixed income and up to 25% in a combination of other investments such as real estate, hedge funds and private equity. Investment managers have full discretion as to investment decisions regarding all funds under their management to the extent permitted within investment guidelines.
There are no direct investments in Anadarko securities included in plan assets; however, there may be indirect investments in Anadarko securities through the plans mutual fund investments. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption was determined starting with the year-end 2009 pension investment balances by category and projected target asset allocations for 2010. The expected return for each of these categories was determined by using capital-market projections. Anadarkos expected long-term rate of return for U.S. defined-benefit pension plan assets is a blended average of the projected long-term returns for the various asset classes, weighted by the asset allocation. Returns on asset classes are developed using a forward-looking building-block approach and are not strictly based upon historical returns. Equity returns are generally developed as the sum of inflation, expected real earnings growth and expected long-term dividend yield. Bond returns are generally developed as the sum of inflation, real bond yield and risk spread (as appropriate), adjusted for the expected effect on returns from changing yields. Other asset class returns are derived from their relationship to the equity and bond markets. Consideration was also given to current market conditions.

Fair value of investments included as Level 3 measurements are estimates based on the net asset values, but the underlying assets are not traded in active markets.
The following table sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the Level 3 assets for the year ended December31, 2009.

Investment securities are exposed to various risks, such as interest-rate, credit and market risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, it is reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities could significantly impact the plan assets.
The plan assets may include securities with contractual cash flows, such as asset-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and commercial mortgage-backed securities, including securities backed by subprime mortgage loans. The value, liquidity and related income of those securities are sensitive to changes in economic conditions, including real estate value, delinquencies or defaults, or both, and may be adversely affected by shifts in the markets perception of the issuers and changes in interest rates.

After considering the effect of income taxes, the adjustments recorded in the first quarter of 2008 related to the adoption of the successful efforts method of accounting in the third quarter of 2007, reduced net earnings for the year ended December31, 2008 by $52million.
119 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES (Unaudited) In December 2009, Anadarko adopted revised oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements. The primary impact of the new disclosures is to conform the definition of proved reserves with the SEC Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting rules, which were issued by the SEC at the end of 2008. The accounting standards update revised the definition of proved oil and gas reserves to require that the average, first-day-of-the-month price during the 12-month period before the end of the year rather than the year-end price, must be used when estimating whether reserve quantities are economical to produce. This same 12-month average price is also used in calculating the aggregate amount of (and changes in) future cash inflows related to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. The rules also allow for the use of reliable technology to estimate proved oil and gas reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated to result in reliable conclusions about reserve volumes. The unaudited supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities for 2009 has been presented in accordance with the new reserve estimation and disclosure rules, which may not be applied retrospectively. The 2006, 2007 and 2008 data are presented in accordance with FASB oil and gas disclosure requirements effective during those periods. However, historical information has been reclassified to conform to the geographic areas required to be disclosed for 2009 under the revised accounting standard. Disclosures by geographic area include the United States and International geographic areas, which are located primarily in Algeria, China and Ghana. The effect of applying the new definition of reliable technology and other non-price related aspects of the updated rules did not significantly impact 2009 net proved reserve volumes. Less than 1% of the Companys total proved reserves, as of year-end 2009, were added as a result of pressure-gradient analyses, well-control and seismic reliable technologies. The effect of applying the 12-month average price, versus the 2009 year-end price, decreased the net remaining reserve volumes by less than 3% of total proved reserves. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows for 2009 decreased by $8.3billion as a result of using the 12-month average price rather than the year-end 2009 price.
120 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES (Unaudited) Oil and Gas Reserves The reserve disclosures that follow reflect estimates of proved reserves, proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves, net of royalty interests, of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs owned at year end and changes in proved reserves during the last three years. Natural-gas volumes are inbillions of cubic feet (Bcf) at a pressure base of 14.73 pounds per square inch and volumes for oil, condensate and NGLs are inmillions of barrels (MMBbls). Total volumes are inmillions of barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE). For this computation, one barrel is assumed to be the equivalent of 6,000 cubic feet of gas. NGLs are included with oil and condensate reserves and associated shrinkage has been deducted from the gas reserves.
International reserves are calculated in accordance with the terms of their respective agreements using the economic interest method. The international reserves include estimated quantities allocated to Anadarko for recovery of costs and income taxes and Anadarkos net equity share after recovery of such costs.
The estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions as well as changes in the expected recovery rates associated with infill drilling.
During 2009, Anadarko added 70 MMBOE of proved reserves primarily as the result of successful drilling in the United States and at international locations. Reserve revisions for 2009 include an increase of 212 MMBOE primarily related to large onshore natural-gas plays, such as the Greater Natural Buttes and Pinedale fields, as a result of successful infill drilling (where the reserve bookings for the infill wells are treated as a positive revision). The revisions include a decrease of 39 MMBOE driven by lower gas pricing. Sales and acquisitions of proved reserves in place were 24 and 32 MMBOE, respectively, related to onshore domestic assets. In 2008, Anadarko added 102 MMBOE of proved reserves primarily as the result of successful drilling in the Rockies and developments and appraisals in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Reserve revisions for 2008 included an increase of 188 MMBOE primarily as a result of successful infill drilling related to the large onshore natural-gas plays, such as the Greater Natural Buttes, Wattenberg and Pinedale fields, in addition to positive revisions to the Peregrino field offshore Brazil which was sold in 2008, partially offset by a decrease of 102 MMBOE related to price impacts for oil and NGLs. Sales of proved reserves in place for 2008 totaled 137 MMBOE, related to properties located in the United States and Brazil. During 2007, sales of proved reserves in place associated with the Companys asset-realignment program totaled 620 MMBOE. Excluding the effect of divestitures, the Company added approximately 252 MMBOE of proved reserves in 2007. Reserve adds were primarily driven by successful drilling in coalbed methane and conventional plays and successful infill drilling onshore in the United States, as well as the initial recognition of proved reserves for the Peregrino development offshore Brazil.

125 Table of Contents ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES (Unaudited) Results of Operations for Producing Activities Results of operations for producing activities consist of all activities within the Oil and Gas Exploration& Production segment. Net revenues from production include only the revenues from the production and sale of gas, oil, condensate and NGLs. Gains on property dispositions represent net gains on sales of oil and gas properties. Reversal of accrual for DWRRA dispute represents reversal of the liability accrued for potential additional royalties due on leases subject to litigation with the Department of Interior as described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Production costs are those incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities used in oil and gas operations. Exploration expenses include dry hole costs, leasehold impairments, geological and geophysical expenses, and the costs of retaining undeveloped leaseholds. Income tax expense is calculated by applying the current statutory tax rates to the revenues after deducting costs, which include DD&A allowances, after giving effect to permanent differences. The results of operations exclude general office overhead and interest expense attributable to oil and gas activities.

Prices used for all periods are adjusted only for fixed and determinable amounts under provisions in existing contracts. Estimated future net cash flows for all periods presented are reduced by estimated future development, production, abandonment and dismantlement costs based on existing costs, assuming continuation of existing economic conditions, and by estimated future income tax expense. These estimates also include assumptions about the timing of future production of proved reserves, and timing of future development, production costs, and abandonment and dismantlement. Income tax expense, both U.S. and foreign, is calculated by applying the existing statutory tax rates, including any known future changes, to the pretax net cash flows giving effect to any permanent differences and reduced by the applicable tax basis. The effect of tax credits is considered in determining the income tax expense. The 10-percent discount factor is prescribed by GAAP.
The present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of Anadarkos proved reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, anticipated changes in future prices and costs, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas. Significant changes in estimated reserve volumes or commodity prices could have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
