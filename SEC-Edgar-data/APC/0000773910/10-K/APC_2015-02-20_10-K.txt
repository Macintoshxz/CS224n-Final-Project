OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES AND ACTIVITIES The map below illustrates the locations of Anadarkos oil and natural-gas exploration and production operations.
3 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements United States Overview Anadarkos U.S. operations include oil and natural-gas exploration and production onshore in the Lower 48 states, the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and onshore Alaska. The Companys U.S. operations accounted for 89% of total sales volumes during 2014 and 92% of total proved reserves at year-end 2014 .
Rocky Mountains Region Anadarkos Rocky Mountains Region (Rockies) properties include oil and natural-gas plays located in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming where the Company operates approximately 14,500 wells and owns an interest in approximately 8,000 nonoperated wells. Anadarko operates fractured-carbonate/shale reservoirs, tight-gas assets, coalbed-methane (CBM) natural-gas assets, and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects within the region. The Company also has fee ownership of mineral rights under approximately eightmillion acres that pass through Colorado, Wyoming, and into Utah (known as the Land Grant). Management considers the Land Grant a significant competitive advantage for Anadarko as it enhances the Companys economic returns from production on Land Grant acreage, offers drilling opportunities for the Company without expiration, and allows the Company to capture royalty revenue from third-party activity on Land Grant acreage. The Company also believes its liquids-rich reservoirs, strong well performance, low development and operating costs, and large expandable midstream infrastructure each provide tangible benefits to the Company.
Activities in the Rockies primarily focus on expanding existing fields to increase production and adding proved reserves through horizontal drilling, infill drilling, and down-spacing operations. The Company focused its 2014 capital investments in areas that offer high liquids yields (liquids-rich areas), which resulted in significant oil production growth. In 2014 , total-year Rockies sales volumes increased 10% over 2013 , with a 45% or 49 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d) increase in liquids volumes. The Company drilled 569 wells and completed 487wells in the Rockies during 2014 . The Company plans to continue its drilling program in 2015 , focusing on the Wattenberg field.
4 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Wattenberg Anadarko operates approximately 5,800 vertical wells and 750horizontal wells in the Wattenberg field. The field contains the Niobrara and Codell formations, which are naturally fractured formations that hold liquids and natural gas. During 2014 , the Companys drilling program focused entirely on horizontal development, drilling 369horizontal wells. Sales volumes in the Wattenberg field increased 55% compared to 2013 , with year-over-year increases of 69% in oil volumes and 79% in total liquids volumes. Horizontal drilling results in the Wattenberg field continue to be strong, with economics that are enhanced by the Land Grant mineral interest, a consolidated core acreage position, and recent enhancements in infrastructure and takeaway capacity.
Major facility and takeaway expansions occurred in 2014. The Lancaster cryogenic plant and Front Range Pipeline (FRP) were commissioned in 2014. The Lancaster cryogenic plant resulted in a field-wide increase in NGLs recoveries and the FRP resulted in access to the premium Mt. Belvieu NGLs market. Gas processing capacity is expected to increase in mid-2015 with the addition of Lancaster II, which is a second 300 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) cryogenic processing facility currently under construction. The White Cliffs pipeline expansion was completed in the third quarter of 2014, providing additional oil transportation capacity for the region. Management believes that Anadarko is well-positioned with its oil and NGLs export capacity, which includes transport by pipeline, rail, and truck.
Greater Natural Buttes The Greater Natural Buttes area in eastern Utah is one of the Companys major tight-gas assets. The Company utilizes both refrigeration and cryogenic processing facilities in this area to extract NGLs from the natural-gas stream.
The Company operates approximately 2,800wells in the Greater Natural Buttes area and drilled 133wells in 2014 . The Company operated the field at a reduced activity level for the majority of 2014 due to capital allocation to higher-margin projects.
Powder River Deep The Company drilled 10 horizontal wells in the Powder River basin during 2014 as part of a multi-objective horizontal exploration program targeting oil opportunities. The Company has seen encouraging results in the Niobrara and Turner formations. Anadarko controls over 350,000 acres of deep mineral rights within the Powder River basin.
Coalbed Methane Properties Anadarko operates approximately 2,300CBM wells and owns an interest in approximately 2,500nonoperated CBM wells in the Rockies, primarily located in the Powder River basin in Wyoming and the Helper and Clawson fields in Utah. Anadarko controls over 640,000acres of shallow rights within the Powder River basin. CBM is natural gas that is generated and stored within coal seams. To produce CBM, water is extracted from the coal seam, resulting in reduced pressure and the release of natural gas, which flows to the wellhead. The Company operated the field at a reduced activity level in 2014 due to capital allocation to higher-margin projects.
Salt Creek and Monell During 2014 , the Company continued the development of its Rockies EOR assets in the Salt Creek and Monell fields in Wyoming. The Companys EOR operations use carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to stimulate oil production from mature reservoirs after primary and water-flood recovery methods have been completed. Significant gains in production were achieved in this area due to the Companys ongoing development programs, with oil production rising 10% in 2014 . In 2015 , the Company plans to continue the management of these fields to enhance CO 2 flooding operations.
In 2012, the Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement where a third party agreed to fund $400million of development costs in exchange for a 23% interest in the Companys EOR development in the Salt Creek field in Wyoming. The funding commitment was completed in 2014.
Laramie County, Wyoming Anadarko holds ownership in more than 100,000 mineral-interest acres in this emerging liquids-rich play, targeting the Niobrara and Codell formations in the northern DJ Basin. In 2014, the Company participated in more than 70 nonoperated wells testing the Niobrara and Codell formations.Early results from wells drilled in 2014 are encouraging, as results from the 19nonoperated wells that are currently producing remain strong with initial 30-day net production averagingapproximately 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d).
5 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Greater Green River Basin Anadarko operates over 1,400 wells in the Wamsutter and Moxa fields, which are primarily dry-gas assets. The Company also carries a nonoperated position in 2,600 wells between the two fields. Much of this producing area is in the Land Grant, which improves the economics of projects in the area.
In late 2013, Anadarko acquired additional working interests and became the operator in the Moxa field, increasing the Companys net production by approximately 6,500 BOE/d. In 2014, additional value was realized through reduction in the decline rates and decreasing operating costs.
In January 2014, Anadarko sold its interest in the Pinedale/Jonah assets in Wyoming for $581million.
Southern and Appalachia Region Anadarkos Southern and Appalachia Region properties are primarily located in Texas, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, and Kansas. The region includes the Eagleford shale in South Texas, the Delaware basin in West Texas, the Marcellus shale in north-central Pennsylvania, and the Haynesville shale in East Texas and Louisiana. Operations in these areas are focused on finding and developing both natural gas and liquids from shales, tight sands, and fractured-reservoir plays.
During 2014 , the Company continued to focus on liquids-rich opportunities across the region by expanding drilling activity in the emerging Wolfcamp shale play in the Delaware basin and other shale plays, while continuing its existing liquids-rich projects in the Eagleford shale, Delaware basin, and East Texas/North Louisiana plays. The Company has reduced costs and benefited from improved cycle-time efficiencies in both drilling and completion operations across all operating areas in the region.
In 2014 , total-year sales volumes in the Southern and Appalachia Region increased 16% over 2013 , with a 33% increase in liquids volumes. The Company drilled 589 operated horizontal wells and brought 730 wells online in 2014 . In 2015 , the Company expects to continue its horizontal drilling program, focusing on the Texas assets.
6 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Eagleford The Eagleford shale development in South Texas consists of approximately 357,000 gross acres and over 1,100 producing wells.The Company drilled 393 wells, completed 388 wells, and brought 385 wells online generating 47% sales volume growth year over year.
Anadarko entered 2014 with 10 drilling rigs and reduced the rig count to eight by the end of 2014 due to outstanding drilling performance. To facilitate additional completion activities, water infrastructure was expanded in 2014, increasing capacity by 75 thousand barrels per day (MBbls/d). The Company continues to test concepts for additional recovery across its acreage position and completed successful tests on two upper-Eagleford shale wells.
Delaware Basin Anadarko holds an interest in over 600,000 gross acres in the Delaware basin. Anadarkos 2014 drilling activity primarily targeted the liquids-rich Bone Spring formation, the Avalon shale, and the developing Wolfcamp shale play. In 2014, Anadarko drilled 97operated wells and participated in 43nonoperated wells. Significant infrastructure was added, which increased NGLs sales volumes by 82% over 2013. In addition, in November 2014, Western Gas Partners, LP (WES), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, acquired Nuevo Midstream, LLC (Nuevo), which has gathering and processing assets located intheDelaware basin. The Company had one operated rig drilling in the Bone Spring formation, one operated rig drilling in the Avalon shale, and eight operated rigs drilling in the Wolfcamp shale at year-end 2014.
The successful Wolfcamp shale delineation program continues to deliver encouraging results across the majority of Anadarkos acreage position. Anadarko is testing multiple zones within the Wolfcamp shale and several development concepts including multi-well pads, extended laterals, and horizontal well spacing for increased efficiency. The Company has identified thousands of potential drilling locations in the Wolfcamp formations that are expected to provide substantial opportunity for Anadarkos continued activity in the basin.
Eaglebine Anadarko holds 156,000 gross acres in the Eaglebine shale in Southeast Texas, most of which is held by existing Austin Chalk production. In 2014 , Anadarko continued to delineate and develop this acreage with a one-rig drilling program. In September 2014 , the Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement requiring a third party to fund $442million of Anadarkos capital costs in exchange for a 34% working interest in the Eaglebine development. Anadarko will remain the operator with an average post-transaction working interest of approximately 51%. This transaction allows the Company to develop this oil opportunity while further enhancing Anadarkos capital efficiency and flexibility. At December31,2014, $22million of the total $442million obligation had been funded.
East Texas/North Louisiana Anadarko holds 293,000 gross acres in East Texas/North Louisiana. Anadarko increased its capital program in the East Texas Carthage area in 2014, targeting a liquids-rich area in the Haynesville shale. In 2014 , Anadarko operated six rigs and drilled 52 wells in the Haynesville and Cotton Valley formations. The Company increased sales volumes from the area by 10% year over year.
Marcellus The Company holds 654,000 gross acres in the Marcellus shale of the Appalachian basin. During the year, 24operated horizontal wells were drilled using one rig. Anadarko also participated in drilling an additional 78nonoperated horizontal wells in 2014 . The Companys production in Marcellus continued to improve with sales volumes increasing 12% over 2013.
7 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Gulf of Mexico In the Gulf of Mexico, Anadarko owns an average 61% working interest in 394 blocks. The Company operates seven active floating platforms and holds interests in 23 producing fields. During 2014 , the Company advanced development of the Lucius and Heidelberg projects and continued an active deepwater development and appraisal program in the Gulf of Mexico as it continues to take advantage of its existing infrastructure to accelerate development activities at reduced costs.
The following includes the significant development, exploration, and appraisal activity in the Gulf of Mexico during 2014 .
Development Lucius The Company realized first production at the Anadarko-operated Lucius Spar in January 2015, bringing on three wells initially and ramping up production with an additional three wells expected to come online during the first quarter of 2015. The successful Lucius project was developed with production startup only three years from sanction and five years from discovery. The 80-MBbls/d spar resides in Keathley Canyon Block 875 with a water depth of 7,100 feet.
A carried-interest arrangement with a third party, entered into in 2012, provided funding for the substantial majority of Anadarkos development capital commitment through first production. Following the carried-interest arrangement and 2014 equity re-determination, the Company holds a 23.8% working interest in Lucius.
Heidelberg The Company continues to advance the Anadarko-operated Heidelberg development project, which was sanctioned during the second quarter of 2013. The construction of the 80-MBbls/d spar is progressing on schedule with anticipated start-up in 2016. At December 31, 2014, fabrication of the main topsides module was more than 70% complete and ahead of schedule.
In 2013, the Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement requiring a third party to fund $860million of capital costs in exchange for a 12.75%working interest in the project. The carry obligation is expected to cover the substantial majority of the Companys expected future capital costs through first production. At December31,2014, $386million of the $860million obligation had been funded. Anadarko holds a 31.5% working interest in Heidelberg. Development drilling commenced in late 2014 on two development wells.
8 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Caesar/Tonga At Caesar/Tonga (33.75% working interest), the Company successfully completed a fourth development well (GC 727#2) in the first quarter of 2014, and the well is producing 10 MBbls/d of oil. Anadarko is currently completing a fifth development well (GC 683#2), which is expected to come online during the first quarter of 2015.
K2 At K2 (41.8% working interest), the GC 562 #5 infill well found 210 feet of oil pay in the Miocene, and the well is being sidetracked for a subsequent completion. The well is expected to come online in the second half of2015.
Constitution At Constitution (100% working interest), the Company executed a successful platform drilling program in 2014, where the A1 well was sidetracked, completed, and brought online producing 3 MBbls/d of oil.
Vito In 2014, Anadarko sold its 18.67% working interest in the nonoperated Vito deepwater development, along with several surrounding exploration blocks, for $500 million.
Exploration Three exploration wells were drilled in the Gulf of Mexico during 2014. The Deep Nansen exploration well (35% working interest) targeted Lower Tertiary-aged sediments in a large, four-way structure beneath Anadarkos Nansen field and found non-commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and the well was plugged and abandoned. The evidence of a working petroleum system is being incorporated into potential future activity on the surrounding leasehold.The Bimini exploration well (50% working interest) was drilled in Garden Banks close to existing infrastructure at the Anadarko-operated Power Play field and near the Conger field and Baldpate Platform. The well tested a subsalt Miocene prospect and was plugged and abandoned. The K2 development well was drilled deeper to test the Wilcox potential beneath the existing field in Green Canyon and did not find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons in the Wilcox objective. The K2 well will be sidetracked and completed in a field pay interval. Also, the Yeti exploration well (37.5% nonoperated working interest) was spud prior to year end. The well will test a Miocene sub-salt three-way closure in Walker Ridge.
Appraisal Shenandoah Basin The Company spud the Shenandoah-3 well, its second appraisal well at the Shenandoah discovery, in the second quarter of 2014. The well finished drilling at the end of 2014 and found approximately 50% (1,470 feet) more of the same reservoir sands 1,500 feet down-dip and 2.3 miles east of the Shenandoah-2 well, which encountered over 1,000 feet of net oil pay in excellent quality Lower Tertiary-aged sands. The Shenandoah-3 well confirmed the sand depositional environment, lateral sand continuity, excellent reservoir qualities, and down-dip thickening.The well also enabled the projection of oil-water contacts based on pressure data and reduced the uncertainty of the resource range. Planning is underway for the next appraisal well, which the Company expects to spud in the second quarter of 2015.
An appraisal well at the Coronado discovery (35% working interest) reached total depth during the second quarter of 2014 and did not find the Lower Miocene objective and was plugged and abandoned.
During the third quarter of 2014, the first appraisal well of the Yucatan discovery (25% working interest) was drilled down-dip of the original discovery, and found approximately 57 gross feet of pay in Lower Tertiary oil-bearing sands. The Yucatan discovery is located approximately three miles south of the Shenandoah discovery.
Alaska Anadarkos nonoperated oil production and development activity in Alaska is concentrated on the North Slope. Infrastructure construction began in 2013 on the Alpine West satellite development, a 15-to-20-well extension of the Alpine field. Drilling at Alpine West is scheduled to commence in mid-2015 with production anticipated to come online in late 2015 or early 2016.
9 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements International Overview Anadarkos international operations include oil, natural-gas, and NGLs production and development in Mozambique, Algeria, and Ghana. The Company also has exploration acreage in Brazil, Colombia, Cte dIvoire, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Mozambique, New Zealand, and other countries. International locations accounted for 11% of Anadarkos total sales volumes and 21% of sales revenues during 2014 , and 8% of total proved reserves at year-end 2014 . In 2015 , the Company expects to focus itsexploration and appraisal activity in East Africa, Cte dIvoire, and Colombia.
Mozambique Anadarko operates two blocks (one onshore and one offshore) totaling approximately 5.3 million gross acres at December 31, 2014. From a construction, finance, and marketing perspective, the Company is positioned to commence project execution and deliver first cargoes in the expected 2019 timeframe; however, the pace of this project is dependent upon securing necessary approvals from the government of Mozambique.
Development In February 2014, the Company sold a 10% working interest in Offshore Area 1 in Mozambique for $2.64billion. Anadarko remains the operator of Offshore Area 1 with a working interest of 26.5%.
During 2014, the Company obtained reserves certification from a third party indicating sufficient volumes to support an initial LNG development. The Environmental Impact Assessment was approved by the government of Mozambique. The Company completed front-end engineering and design (FEED) for the onshore liquefaction facilities and the offshore gathering infrastructure and is in the process of selecting the contractor groups for construction.Anadarko and its partners reached non-binding Heads of Agreements for long-term LNG sales to buyers in Asian markets covering in excess of eight million metric tonnes per annum. In December 2014, the Mozambique government published a Decree Law that is sufficient to continue progressing project finance, marketing, and construction and operation of an LNG project. This legislation marks a critical step toward establishing a project-wide legal and contractual framework that delivers a level of fiscal stability enabling continued equity investments by the Company and potential access to significant limited-recourse project finance capital.
10 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Exploration In the Offshore Area 1, the Tubaro Tigre-1 exploration well was drilled approximately 37 miles south of the Orca-1 discovery well and encountered more than 92feet of net gas pay in Paleocene sands. The Ourio do Mar exploration well was drilled 22.5 miles south of the Orca-1 discovery well and tested the potential down-dip extent of the Paleocene reservoirs found in the Orca and Tubaro Tigre discoveries. The well was plugged and abandoned during the third quarter of 2014. Appraisal of the Orca discovery continued with the drilling of three appraisal wells. During the first quarter of 2014, the Orca-2 well encountered 151 feet of Paleocene reservoir sand with the top 26 feet being charged, establishing the gas/water contact for the discovery. The rig moved to the Orca-3 location and encountered 102 net feet of natural-gas pay in the Paleocene. The Orca-4 well reached total depth during the fourth quarter of 2014 encountering natural-gas pay in two reservoirs. At the end of 2014, the rig was located at Tubaro Tigre-2 drilling the first appraisal well associated with the Tubaro Tigre discovery. Data from these wells will be used to further delineate the size of the resource and determine future appraisal activity for the Orca and Tubaro Tigre discoveries.
In the Onshore Rovuma (35.7% working interest), the Anadarko-operated Tembo-1 well completed drilling at the end of the fourth quarter in 2014. The well encountered gas and condensate in one of the Cretaceous reservoirs and post-drill evaluations are underway to determine if additional exploration is warranted within the prospect area. A rig has been mobilized to the second well in the program, Kifaru, which will test Miocene, Oligocene, and Paleocene gas targets near the future LNG facility site.
Algeria Anadarko is engaged in production and development operations in Algerias Sahara Desert in Blocks 404 and 208, which are governed by a Production Sharing Agreement between Anadarko, two other parties, and Sonatrach, the national oil and gas company of Algeria. The Company is responsible for 24.5% of the development and production costs for these blocks. The Company produces oil through the Hassi Berkine South and Ourhoud central processing facilities (CPF) in Block 404 and oil, condensate, and NGLs through the El Merk CPF in Block208. Gross production through these facilities averaged more than 383MBbls/d in 2014, and a quarterly net production record of approximately 75MBOE/d was achieved as all of the fields at the El Merk CPF were increased to full oil production rates. The Company drilled ninedevelopment wells in 2014.
Ghana Anadarkos production and development activities in Ghana are located offshore in the West Cape Three Points Block and the Deepwater Tano Block.
The Jubilee field (27%nonoperated unit interest), which spans both the West Cape Three Points Block and the Deepwater Tano Block, averaged gross production of 102 MBbls/d of oil in 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2014, a pipeline tie-in was completed and natural-gas exports commenced from the Jubilee field to an onshore gas processing plant. The natural-gas exports are being delivered to satisfy a commitment established in conjunction with the Jubilee development plan and are expected to allow increases in future oil production rates. The Company and its partners are evaluating options to further expand the oil throughput capacity of the floating production, storage, and offloading vessel (FPSO) and expect to submit a full-field development plan for the Jubilee field to the government of Ghana in 2015.
The Jubilee J-24 development well was drilled deeper to evaluate the Mahogany sands below the Jubilee reservoirs. Additional appraisal work was completed in 2014 in the Mahogany and Akasa fields and the data is under evaluation.
In 2013, development commenced on the Tweneboa/Enyenra/Ntomme (TEN) project (19% nonoperated working interest). The project will use an 80-MBbls/d-capacity FPSO for production from subsea wells. Significant progress was made during 2014, including engineering design completion, the successful dry-docking of the FPSO, and drilling of the first nine wells. The project was approximately 50% complete at year-end 2014 and remains on budget and on schedule for first production in 2016.
China In August 2014, the Company sold its Chinese subsidiary for $1.075billion.
11 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Brazil Anadarko holds exploration interests in approximately 300,000 gross acres in two offshore blocks located in the Campos basin. At the Wahoo discovery, the Company is evaluating commercialization options by performing pre-FEED and FEED studies.
Colombia During 2014, Anadarko was the high bidder on the COL1, COL 6, and COL 7 blocks. At December 31,2014, Anadarko controls the exclusive rights to explore or conduct technical evaluation activities on nine blocks, totaling 16million acres. The COL1, COL 2, COL 6, and COL 7 blocks are operated at 100% working interest and the remaining blocks are operated at a 50% working interest.
Two initial prospects have been selected for the 2015 exploration drilling program. The Calasu prospect is a large four-way structure on the north end of the Fuerte Norte block. It has multiple targets and success would reduce the risk of several adjacent structures on the block. The Kronos prospect is located in the Fuerte Sur block and will test a large structure associated with the frontal area of a large thrust complex. As with Calasu, success would reduce the risk of multiple prospects. The two-well program commenced in early 2015.
Cte dIvoire Anadarko owns an operated working interest in five offshore blocks totaling approximately 1.3 million acres, including CI-515 and CI-516 each with a 45% working interest, CI-103 with a 65% working interest, and CI-528 and CI-529 each with a 90% working interest.
The Company continued appraisal of the Cretaceous Paon discovery in Block CI-103, where the discovery well encountered 100 feet of net pay. The Paon-3AR was drilled 3.7 miles down-dip to the discovery well and encounteredmore than 94 feet of pay. The well established an oil/water contact and appears to be in communication with the Paon-1X discovery. As a result of the success, the drilling of the Paon-4A was accelerated. The well, located six miles east of the Paon-3AR, penetrated over 37 feet of pay in the target section and defined the eastern extent of the reservoir.During 2014, Anadarko became operator of the block and farmed down a portion of the working interest for a carry on the appraisal activities. Based on the successful drilling program to date, the partnership and the government are currently discussing additional appraisal drilling activity for 2015, which would include a drillstem test.
The Morue prospect in Block CI-516 was drilled and encountered a small accumulation of oil in the well-developed sands in the targeted interval, and was plugged and abandoned as non-commercial.
The Saumon prospect was drilled in Block CI-515 during 2014. The well reached total depth and did not find hydrocarbons. The well was plugged and abandoned.
Kenya Anadarko owns and operates a 45% working interest in five offshore deepwater blocks, encompassing approximately 5.6 million gross acres. An exploration well is currently planned to test a large four-way structure at the Mlima prospect in Block L-11B during 2015.
Liberia Two exploration wells were drilled in Block LB-10 (50% working interest) during 2014. The Anadarko-operated Iroko and Timbo wells both encountered non-commercial quantities of oil in their primary targets and were plugged and abandoned. Post-well evaluation is underway to determine the remaining prospectivity of the block. Anadarko completed a farm down prior to drilling, which covered a majority of the drilling costs for these two wells.
New Zealand Anadarko controls the exclusive rights to explore or conduct technical evaluation activities on four blocks totaling 42 million acres, of which 6.1 million acres are owned under exploration licenses. Anadarko operates a 45% working interest in the Canterbury basin block and a 100% working interest in two Pegasus basin blocks. In the 36 million acre New Caledonia basin block, Anadarko controls a 25% nonoperated working interest. The Caravel prospect reached its total-depth objective in the Canterbury basin block and was plugged and abandoned, having encountered natural gas shows and high-quality reservoir in the primary objective. A seismic acquisition is planned during 2015 on the block.
Other Anadarko also has exploration projects in other overseas, new-venture areas including Tunisia and South Africa.
12 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Proved Reserves Estimates of proved reserves volumes owned at year end, net of third-party royalty interests, are presented in billions of cubic feet (Bcf), at a pressure base of 14.73 pounds per square inch for natural gas and in millions of barrels (MMBbls) for oil, condensate, and NGLs. Total volumes are presented in millions of barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE). For this computation, one barrel is the equivalent of 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas. Shrinkage associated with NGLs has been deducted from the natural-gas reserves volumes. Proved reserves are estimated based on the average beginning-of-month prices during the 12-month period for the respective year.
Disclosures by geographic area include the United States and International. The International geographic area consists of proved reserves located in Algeria and Ghana, which by country and in total represents less than 15% of the Companys total proved reserves. The Company sold its Chinese subsidiary during 2014.

Reserves bookings related to infill drilling additions are treated as positive revisions. Other non-price-related revisions in 2014 are driven by a reduction of 116 MMBOE in the Wattenberg area primarily associated with the optimization of horizontal drilling locations and the discontinuation of vertical well workover plans.
The Companys estimates of proved developed reserves, proved undeveloped reserves (PUDs), and total proved reserves at December31,2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , and changes in proved reserves during the last threeyears are presented in the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities (Supplemental Information) under Item8 of this Form 10-K. Also presented in the Supplemental Information are the Companys estimates of future net cash flows and discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves. See Critical Accounting Estimates under Item7 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the Companys proved reserves.
The Company has not yet filed information with a federal authority or agency with respect to its estimated total proved reserves at December31,2014 . Annually, Anadarko reports gross proved reserves for U.S.-operated properties to the U.S. Department of Energy. These reported reserves are derived from the same database used to estimate and report proved reserves in this Form 10-K.
14 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Changes in PUDs Changes to PUDs occurring during 2014 are summarized in the table below. Revisions of prior estimates reflect Anadarkos ongoing evaluation of its asset portfolio and include updates to prior PUDs, the addition of new PUDs associated with current development plans, the transfer of PUDs to unproved categories due to development plan changes, and the impact of changes in economic conditions, including changes in commodity prices. The Companys year-end development plans and associated PUDs are consistent with SEC guidelines for PUDs development within fiveyears unless specific circumstances warrant a longer development time horizon.
MMBOE PUDs at January1, 2014 789 Revisions of prior estimates 333 Extensions, discoveries, and other additions 32 Conversion to developed (210 ) Sales (55 ) PUDs at December31, 2014 889 Revisions In 2014 , PUD revisions of 333MMBOE were primarily related to successful infill drilling in large onshore areas such as Wattenberg in the Rockies and the Eagleford shale in the Southern and Appalachia Region, partially offset by decreases primarily due to development plan updates.
Extensions, Discoveries, and Other Additions During 2014 , Anadarko added 32MMBOE of PUDs through extensions, discoveries, and other additions, primarily as a result of successful drilling in the Marcellus and Wolfcamp shale plays in the Southern and Appalachia Region.
Conversions In 2014 , the Company converted 210MMBOE, or 27% of total year-end 2013 PUDs, to developed status. Approximately 73% of PUD conversions occurred in U.S. onshore assets, 16%in international assets, and the remaining 11% in Gulf of Mexico assets.
Development activity in the U.S. onshore assets resulted in the conversion of 80 MMBOE in the Southern and Appalachia Region and 72 MMBOE in the Rockies. Ongoing development activity in the Companys Algerian assets resulted in the conversion of 34 MMBOE in 2014. The remaining PUD conversions were associated with development projects in various Gulf of Mexico fields.
Anadarko spent $1.6 billion to develop PUDs in 2014, of which approximately 74% related to U.S. onshore assets, 13% related to Gulf of Mexico assets, and 13% related to international assets.
In 2013 , the Company converted 183MMBOE, or 27% of the total year-end 2012 PUDs, to developed status. Approximately 85% of PUD conversions occurred in U.S. onshore assets, 11% in international assets, and the remaining 4% in Gulf of Mexico assets. Anadarko spent $1.0billion on PUD development in 2013 , of which approximately 70% related to domestic development programs in the Rockies and the Southern and Appalachia Regions, 25% related to development of international projects, and the remaining 5% related to Alaska and Gulf of Mexico development projects.
15 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Development Plans The Company annually reviews all PUDs to ensure an appropriate plan for development exists. Typically, U.S. onshore PUDs are converted to developed reserves within five years of the initial proved reserves booking, but projects such as EOR, arctic development, deepwater development, and international programs may take longer. All of the Companys U.S. onshore PUDs at December31,2014 , were scheduled to be developed within five years, with the exception of the Salt Creek EOR project, the annual development of which is limited by CO 2 supply.
At December31,2014 , the Company had 39MMBOE of pre- 2010 PUDs that remained undeveloped. Approximately 51% of these PUDs are associated with Gulf of Mexico opportunities where longer development times are a result of delays associated with operating in a deepwater environment, including delays associated with the development and adoption of enhanced safety procedures and other regulatory changes following the Deepwater Horizon event.
Another 33% of the Companys pre- 2010 PUDs are associated with the Salt Creek EOR single-development project located in the Rockies. Since 2003, Anadarko has invested an average of $90 million per year to develop the Salt Creek EOR project and will continue similar spending levels in the future.
The remaining pre- 2010 PUDs are associated with the El Merk development project and are being developed according to an Algerian government-approved plan. Anadarko and its partners achieved initial oil production in 2013 and the El Merk facility reached maximum allowable oil production rates in 2014 when all the fields were brought online and the facility became fully operational.
Technologies Used in Proved Reserves Estimation The Companys 2014 proved reserves additions were based on estimates generated through the integration of relevant geological, engineering, and production data, using technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results as defined in the SEC regulations. Data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface through wellbores, such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and performance information. The data used also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements such as seismic data. The tools used to interpret the data included proprietary and commercially available seismic processing software and commercially available reservoir modeling and simulation software. Reservoir parameters from analogous reservoirs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates when available. The method or combination of methods used to estimate the reserves of each reservoir was based on the unique circumstances of each reservoir and the dataset available at the time of the estimate.
Internal Controls over Reserves Estimation Anadarkos estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows were made solely by the Companys engineers and are the responsibility of management. The Company requires that reserves estimates be made by qualified reserves estimators (QREs), as defined by the Society of Petroleum Engineers standards. The QREs are assigned to specific assets within the Companys regions. The QREs interact with engineering, land, and geoscience personnel to obtain the necessary data for projecting future production, net cash flows, and ultimate recoverable reserves. Management within each region approves the QREs reserves estimates. All QREs receive ongoing education on the fundamentals of SEC definitions and reserves reporting through the Companys reserves manual and internal training programs administered by the Corporate Reserves Group (CRG).
The CRG ensures confidence in the Companys reserves estimates by maintaining internal policies for estimating and recording reserves in compliance with applicable SEC definitions and guidance. Compliance with the SEC reserves guidelines is the primary responsibility of Anadarkos CRG.
The CRG is managed through the Companys finance department, which is separate from its operating regions, and is responsible for overseeing internal reserves reviews and approving the Companys reserves estimates. The Director-Reserves Administration and the Corporate Reserves Manager manage the CRG and report to the VP-Corporate Planning. The VP-Corporate Planning reports to the Companys Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, who in turn reports to the Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. The Governance and Risk Committee of the Companys Board of Directors meets with management, members of the CRG, and the Companys independent petroleum consultants, Miller and Lents, Ltd. (M&L), to discuss the results of procedures and methods reviews as discussed below, as well as other matters and policies related to reserves.
16 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Companys principal engineer, who is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of proved reserves estimates, has over 28 years of experience in the oil and gas industry, including over 14years as either a reserves estimator or manager. His further professional qualifications include a degree in petroleum engineering, extensive internal and external reserves training, and asset evaluation and management. The principal engineer is a member of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and the Society of Petroleum Engineers, where he has been a member for over 28years. In addition, he is an active participant in industry reserves seminars and professional industry groups.
Third-Party Procedures and Methods Reviews M&L reviewed the procedures and methods used by Anadarkos staff in preparing the Companys estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows at December31,2014 . The purpose of the review was to determine if the procedures and methods used by Anadarko to estimate its proved reserves are effective and in accordance with the definitions contained in SEC regulations. The procedures and methods reviews by M&L were limited reviews of Anadarkos procedures and methods and do not constitute a complete review, audit, independent estimate, or confirmation of the reasonableness of Anadarkos estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows.
The reviews covered 16 fields that included major assets in the United States and Africa, and encompassed approximately 88% of the Companys estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows at December31,2014 . In each review, Anadarkos technical staff presented M&L with an overview of the data, methods, and assumptions used in estimating its reserves. The data presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, well performance data, operating procedures, and relevant economic criteria.
Managements intent in retaining M&L to review its procedures and methods is to provide objective third-party input on the Companys procedures and methods and to gather industry information applicable to reserves estimation and reporting processes.

Through ownership and operation of these facilities, the Company improves its ability to manage costs, controls the timing of bringing on new production, and enhances the value received for gathering, processing, treating, and transporting the Companys production. Anadarkos midstream business also provides services to third-party customers, including major and independent producers. Anadarko generates revenues from its midstream activities through a variety of contract structures, including fixed-fee, percent-of-proceeds, and keep-whole agreements. Anadarkos midstream activities include WES, which is a publicly traded limited partnership formed by Anadarko to own, operate, acquire, and develop midstream assets. WESs general partner interest is owned by Western Gas Equity Partners, LP (WGP), a publicly traded consolidated subsidiary formed to own substantially all of the partnership interests in WES previously owned by Anadarko. At December31,2014 , Anadarkos ownership interest in WGPconsisted of an 88.3% limited partner interest and the entirenon-economic general partner interest. At December31,2014 , WGPs ownership interest in WES consisted of a 34.9% limited partner interest, the entire 1.8% general partner interest, and all of the WES incentive distribution rights. At December31,2014 , Anadarko also owned an 8.3% limited partner interest in WES through other subsidiaries.
At the end of 2014 , Anadarko had 41 gathering systems and 38 processing and treating plants located throughout major onshore producing basins in Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Texas. In 2014 , the Companys midstream activity was concentrated in liquids-rich growth areas such as Wattenberg, Greater Natural Buttes, the Delaware basin, the Eagleford shale, and East Texas/North Louisiana plays, as well as in the Marcellus shale dry-gas play. In 2015, the Company plans to continue midstream investments in these core areas.
Wattenberg The Company is constructing a second 300-MMcf/d train at its Lancaster cryogenic processing plant, with completion expected in the second quarter of 2015. The plant will support the increasing production from horizontal drilling in the Niobraradevelopment, helping to relieve processing constraints and improve recoveries of NGLs in the basin. Three new compressor stations are scheduled to come online in the first quarter of 2015 with a total capacity of 120 MMcf/d. In addition, the Company is constructing a Central Oil Stabilization Facility (COSF) with an expected completion date of mid-year 2015.The COSF will stabilize oil in a centralized location and will reduce equipment and installation cost at each well pad.Initial planned throughput for the facility is 125MBbls/d.
21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company participates in two long-haul NGL pipeline joint ventures, FRP and Texas Express Pipeline (TEP), which provide access to the Gulf Coast NGLs market. The FRP, which is connected to the Companys Lancasterprocessing facility, was placed in service in the first quarter of 2014. The FRP extends 435 miles, providing 150MBbls/d (expandable to 230 MBbls/d) of NGLs takeaway capacity from Weld County, Colorado to Skellytown, Texas. In Skellytown, the FRP connects to other pipelines including the TEP. The TEP extends 593 miles providing 280MBbls/d (expandable to 400 MBbls/d) of NGLs takeaway capacity to NGLs fractionation and storage facilities in Mont Belvieu, Texas. The Company has ownership interests of 33% in the FRP, 20% in the TEP, and 25% in two NGLs fractionators at Mont Belvieu.
In July 2014, construction of the second pipeline for the White Cliffs Pipeline system was completed and placed in service.This 526-mile dual pipeline system now provides 150 MBbls/d of oil takeaway capacity fromPlatteville, Colorado to Cushing, Oklahoma. The Company and its joint-venture partners are currently expanding the existing pipeline system to over 200 MBbls/d.The expansion project is scheduled to be completed in mid-2015.
Greater Natural Buttes Chipetas total processing capacity (cryogenic and refrigeration) is approximately one billion cubic feet per day with cryogenic processing capacity exceeding 600 MMcf/d. Chipetas third-party pipeline interconnect has added over 100 MMcf/d of natural-gas supply to the plant. Optimization projects, including several pipeline-freeze mitigation projects in the gathering system, have continued to improve the Companys reliability and efficiency.
Wyoming During the second half of 2014, the Company connected five third-party well locations to the Patrick Draw plant.Initial deliveries are expected in the first quarter of 2015. The Company also constructed a 10-mile pipelineinthe Barricade unit to gather and deliver the incremental third-party gas to the Companys Patrick Draw plant for processing.Also, gathering connections and expansions in 2014 increased throughput of the Hilight plant by about 40%.
Delaware Basin In 2014, the Company expanded its midstream infrastructure for BoneSpring, Wolfcamp, and Avalonproduction in the Delaware basin of West Texas, installing a total of 127 miles of oil and gas gatheringlines.Also,significant progress was made towards expanding three central production facilities that will add 30MBbls/d ofcapacity upon completion in early 2015. Substantial progress was made on a new CGF with a capacity of 24MMcf/d, which will be completed in early 2015. The Company entered into a joint-venture agreement with a third party to construct a new 200-MMcf/d cryogenic plant located in Loving County, Texas. The new plant will be operated by the third party.
In November 2014, WES acquired Nuevo, which owns and operates gathering and processing assets located intheDelaware basin. Following the acquisition, WES changed the name of Nuevo to Delaware Basin Midstream, LLC (DBM). The assets include a 300-MMcf/d cryogenic gas processing plant. WES is preparing to construct an additional 200-MMcf/d cryogenic unit (Train IV) and progress payments have been made towards the construction of another cryogenic unit (Train V), with both expected to come online in 2016.
Eagleford In the Eagleford shale, Anadarko continued the expansion of its infield gathering system with (i) the installation of two new field gas compression facilities, (ii) the addition of incremental compression at Stumberg and Catarina Ranch compressor stations, and the Maverick main central delivery point compression facilities, as well as three other existing field compression facilities, (iii) the completion of approximately 90 miles of gathering pipelines and lateral that connected more than 20 central production facilities, and (iv) enhancements at the main oil-handling facility that increased its reliability and capabilities. The 200-MMcf/d Brasada natural-gas cryogenic processing plant completed its first full year of operations and remains at or near capacity.
22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements East Texas/North Louisiana In East Texas, the Company continued to expand its midstream infrastructure for Cotton Valley Taylor and Haynesville production in 2014. The high-pressure Haynesville gathering system, and related water and condensate infrastructure, was expanded in the Carthage area to handle the continued growth associated with the liquids-rich Haynesville natural-gas production. Additionally, Anadarko has secured access to 430 MMcf/d of firm-processing capacity for the Companys current and future development in East Texas.
Marcellus In the Marcellus shale, Anadarko continued to expand its gathering system in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. In 2014, the Company connected 44 Anadarko-operated wells and constructed 52 miles of new pipeline.The Seely West trunk line, completed in December 2014, connects the COP 356/357 gathering system and Larrys Creek gathering system to the Seely gathering system and alleviates the need to use third parties to gather natural gas.
Springfield In September 2014, the Company sold the Springfield gathering system located in East Texas to a third party.
San Juan In April 2014, the Company sold the San Juan gathering system located in New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah along with the San Juan River gas processing plant located in New Mexico to a third party.
The following provides information regarding the Companys midstream assets by geographic regions: Area Asset Type Miles of Gathering Pipelines Total Horsepower 2014 Average Net Throughput (MMcf/d) Rocky Mountains Gathering, processing, and treating 11,900 1,244,100 3,800 Texas Gathering, processing, and treating 3,600 248,400 1,100 Mid-Continent and other Gathering 3,300 392,200 1,100 Total 18,800 1,884,700 6,000 MARKETING ACTIVITIES The Companys marketing segment actively manages Anadarkos natural-gas, oil, condensate, and NGLs sales, as well as the Companys anticipated LNG sales. In marketing its production, the Company attempts to minimize market-related shut-ins, maximize realized prices, and manage credit-risk exposure. The Companys sales of natural gas, oil, condensate, and NGLs are generally made at market prices for those products at the time of sale. The Company also purchases natural gas, oil, condensate, and NGLs from third parties, primarily near Anadarkos production areas, to aggregate volumes so that the Company is positioned to fully use transportation, storage and fractionation capacity, facilitate efforts to maximize prices received, and minimize balancing issues with customers and pipelines during operational disruptions.
The Company sells its products under a variety of contract structures including indexed, fixed-price, and cost-escalation-based agreements. The Company also engages in limited trading activities for the purpose of generating profits from exposure to changes in market prices of natural gas, oil, condensate, and NGLs. The Company does not engage in market-making practices and limits its marketing activities to natural-gas, oil, NGLs, and LNG commodity contracts. The Companys marketing-risk position is typically a net short position (reflecting agreements to sell natural gas, oil, and NGLs in the future for specific prices) that is offset by the Companys natural long position as a producer (reflecting ownership of underlying natural-gas and oil reserves). See Commodity-Price Risk under Item7A of this Form 10-K.
23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Natural Gas Anadarko markets its natural-gas production to maximize value and to reduce the inherent risks of physical commodity markets. Anadarkos marketing segment offers supply-assurance and limited risk-management services at competitive prices, as well as other services that are tailored to its customers needs. The Company may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer. The Company controls natural-gas firm-transportation capacity that ensures access to downstream markets, which enables the Company to maximize its natural-gas production. This transportation capacity also provides the opportunity to capture incremental value when price differentials between physical locations exist. The Company stores natural gas in contracted storage facilities to minimize operational disruptions to its ongoing operations and to take advantage of seasonal price differentials. Normally, the Company will have forward contracts in place (physical-delivery or financial derivative instruments) to sell stored natural gas at a fixed price.
Oil, Condensate, and NGLs Anadarkos oil, condensate, and NGLs revenues are derived from production in the United States, Algeria, and Ghana. Most of the Companys U.S. oil and NGLs production is sold under contracts with prices based on market indices, adjusted for location, quality, and transportation. Product from Algeria is sold by tanker as Saharan Blend, condensate, refrigerated propane, and refrigerated butane to customers primarily in the Mediterranean area. Saharan Blend is high-quality crude that provides refiners large quantities of premium products such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Oil from Ghana is sold by tanker as Jubilee Oil to customers around the world. Jubilee Oilis high-quality crude that provides refiners large quantities of premium products such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Prior to the Company divesting its subsidiary in August 2014, oil from China was sold by tanker as Cao Fei Dian Blend to customers primarily in the Far East markets.
COMPETITION The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisition of reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production. The Companys competitors include national oil companies, major oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, individual producers, gas marketers, and major pipeline companies, as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers.

24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements REGULATORYAND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations Anadarkos business operations are subject to numerous international, provincial, federal, regional, state, tribal, and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. The more significant of these existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations include the following U.S. laws and regulations, as amended from time to time:  the U.S. Clean Air Act, which restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources and imposes various pre-construction, monitoring, and reporting requirements  the U.S. Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the federal Clean Water Act (CWA), which regulates discharges of pollutants from facilities to state and federal waters  the U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), which subjects owners and operators of vessels, onshore facilities, and pipelines, as well as lessees or permittees of areas in which offshore facilities are located, to liability for removal costs and damages arising from an oil spill in waters of the United States  U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and natural-gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages  the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, which imposes liability on generators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur  the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which governs the generation, treatment, storage, transport, and disposal of solid wastes, including hazardous wastes  the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act, which ensures the quality of the nations public drinking water through adoption of drinking water standards and controlling the injection of waste fluids into below-ground formations that may adversely affect drinking water sources  the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, which requires facilities to implement a safety hazard communication program and disseminate information to employees, local emergency planning committees, and response departments on toxic chemical uses and inventories  the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act, which establishes workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances, and appropriate control measures  the Endangered Species Act, which restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered and threatened species or their habitats through the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal, or permanent ban in affected areas These laws and regulations, as well as state counterparts, generally restrict the level of pollutants emitted to ambient air, discharges to surface water, and disposals or other releases to surface and below-ground soils and ground water. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of delays in the development of projects; and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of the Companys activities in a particular area.
See Risk Factors under Item1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on hydraulic fracturing, ozone standards, climate change, including methane or other greenhouse gas emissions, and other regulations relating to environmental protection. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards and water quality standards, continue to evolve.
25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Many states and foreign countries where the Company operates also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws, regulations, or analogous controls governing many of these same types of activities. While the legal requirements may be similar in form, in some cases the actual implementation of these requirements may impose additional, or more stringent, conditions or controls that can significantly alter or delay the development of a project or substantially increase the cost of doing business. In addition, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address potential air and water impacts, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on the Companys operations in the United States and in other countries in which Anadarko operates.
The Company has reviewed its potential responsibilities under both OPA and CWA as they relate to the Deepwater Horizon events.
As of the date of filing this Form 10-K with the SEC, no penalties or fines have been assessed by the federal government against the Company under OPA, CWA, and other similar local, state and federal environmental legislation related to the Deepwater Horizon events. However, in December 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the United States, filed a civil lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in New Orleans, Louisiana, against several parties, including the Company, seeking (i)an assessment of civil penalties under the CWA in an amount to be determined by the court, and (ii)a declaratory judgment that such parties are jointly and severally liable without limitation under OPA for all removal costs and damages resulting from the Deepwater Horizon events. For additional information, see Note17Contingencies Deepwater Horizon Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form10-K.
The Company has made and will continue to make operating and capital expenditures, some of which may be material, to comply with environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. These are necessary business costs in the Companys operations and in the oil and natural-gas industry. Although the Company is not fully insured against all environmental and occupational health and safety risks, and the Companys insurance does not cover any penalties or fines that may be issued by a governmental authority, it maintains insurance coverage that it believes is sufficient based on the Companys assessment of insurable risks and consistent with insurance coverage held by other similarly situated industry participants. Nevertheless, it is possible that other developments, such as stricter and more comprehensive environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, as well as claims for damages to property or persons resulting from the Companys operations, could result in substantial costs and liabilities, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, to Anadarko. The Company believes that it is in material compliance with existing environmental and occupational health and safety regulations. Further, the Company believes that the cost of maintaining compliance with these existing laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, but new or more stringently applied existing laws and regulations could increase the cost of doing business, and such increases could be material.
Oil Spill-Response Plan Domestically, the Company is subject to compliance with the federal Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) regulations, which, among other standards, require every owner or operator of a U.S. offshore lease to prepare and submit for approval an oil spill-response plan prior to conducting any offshore operations. The submitted plan is required to provide a detailed description of actions to be taken in the event of a spill, identify contracted spill-response equipment, materials and trained personnel, and stipulate the time necessary to deploy identified resources in the event of a spill. The BSEE regulations may be amended, resulting in changes to the amount and type of spill-response resources to which an owner or operator must maintain ready access. Accordingly, resources available to the Company may change to satisfy any new regulatory requirements, or to adapt to changes in the Companys operations.
Anadarko has in place and maintains both Regional (Central and Western Gulf of Mexico) and Sub-Regional (Eastern Gulf of Mexico) Oil Spill-Response Plans (Plans) for the Companys Gulf of Mexico operations. The Plans detail procedures for a rapid and effective response to spill events that may occur as a result of Anadarkos operations. The Plans are reviewed at least annually and updated as necessary. Drills are conducted at least annually to test the effectiveness of the Plans and include the participation of spill-response contractors, representatives of Clean Gulf Associates (CGA, a not-for-profit association of production and pipeline companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico contractually engaged by the Company for such matters), and representatives of relevant governmental agencies. The Plans must be approved by the BSEE.
26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements As part of the Companys oil spill-response preparedness, and as set forth in the Plans, Anadarko maintains membership in CGA, and has an employee representative on the executive committee of CGA. CGA was created to provide a means of effectively staging response equipment and to provide effective spill-response capability for its member companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico. CGA equipment and capabilities include skimming vessels, barges, boom and dispersants, among others. CGA has executed a support contract with T&T Marine to coordinate bareboat charters and provides for expanded response support. T&T Marine is responsible for inspecting, maintaining, storing, and calling out CGA equipment. T&T Marine has positioned CGAs equipment and materials in a ready state at various staging areas around the Gulf of Mexico. T&T Marine also handles the maintenance and mobilization of CGA non-marine equipment. T&T Marine has service contracts in place with domestic environmental contractors as well as with other companies that provide support services during the execution of spill-response activities.
Anadarko is also a member of the Marine Preservation Association, which provides full access to the Marine Spill Response Corporation (MSRC) cooperative including the Deep Blue enhanced Gulf of Mexico Response capability. In the event of a spill, MSRC stands ready to mobilize all of its equipment and materials. MSRC has a fleet of dedicated Responder Class Oil Spill-Response Vessels (OSRVs), designed and built specifically to recover spilled oil.
MSRC has equipment housed for the Atlantic Region, the Gulf of Mexico Region, the California Region, and the Pacific Northwest Region. Their equipment includes skimmers, OSRVs, fast response vessels, barges, storage bladders, work boats, ocean boom, and dispersant.
The Company has also entered into a contractual commitment to access subsea intervention, containment, capture, and shut-in capacity for deepwater exploration wells. Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC) is open to all oil and gas operators in the Gulf of Mexico and provides members access to oil spill-response equipment and services on a per-well fee basis. Anadarko has an employee representative on the executive committee of MWCC and this employee currently serves as its Chair. MWCC members have access to a containment system that is planned for use in deepwaterdepths of up to 10,000 feet with containment capacity of 100 MBbls/d of liquids and flare capability for 200MMcf/d of natural gas.
Anadarko retains geospatial and satellite imagery services through the MDA Corporation (MDA) to provide coverage over the Companys Gulf of Mexico operations. MDA owns and maintains two radar satellites, which provide all-weather surveillance and imagery available to assist in identifying areas of concern on the surface waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The Company has agreements with Waste Management, Inc. and Clean Harbors to assist in the proper disposal of contaminated and hazardous waste soil and debris. In addition, Anadarko has agreements with HDR Engineering, Inc. for assistance with Subsea Dispersant applications. The Company also has agreements with TDI-Brooks International for its scientific research vessels to properly monitor the effectiveness of the dispersant application and the health of the ecosystem. The Company also has agreements with Scientific and Environmental Associates, Inc. (SEA) for assistance with surface-dispersant applications. SEA is a scientific support consulting firm providing subject matter experts, and is renowned for its expertise in surface-dispersion applications and efficacy monitoring.
Anadarko has emergency and oil spill-response plans in place for each of its exploration and operational activities around the globe. Each plan satisfies the requirements of relevant local or national authority, describes the actions the Company will take in the event of an incident, is subject to drills at least annually, and includes reference to external resources that may become necessary in the event of an incident. Included in these external resources is the Companys contract with Oil Spill Response Limited (OSRL), a global emergency and oil spill-response organization headquartered in London.
OSRL has an aircraft available for dispersant application or equipment transport. OSRL also has a number of active recovery boom systems, and a range of booms that can be used for offshore, nearshore, or shoreline responses. In addition, OSRL provides a range of communications equipment, safety equipment, transfer pumps, dispersant application systems, temporary storage equipment, power packs and generators, small inflatable vessels, rigid inflatable boats, work boats, and Fast Response Vessels. OSRL also has a wide range of oiled wildlife equipment in conjunction with the SeaAlarmFoundation.
In addition to Anadarkos membership in or access to CGA, MSRC, OSRL, and MWCC, the Company participates in industry-wide task forces, which are currently studying improvements in both gaining access to and controlling blowouts in subsea environments. Two such task forces are the Subsea Well Control and Containment Task Force, and the Oil Spill Task Force.
27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements TITLE TO PROPERTIES As is customary in the oil and gas industry, a preliminary title review is conducted at the time properties believed to be suitable for drilling operations are acquired by the Company. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations, thorough title examinations of the drill site tract are conducted by third-party attorneys and curative work is performed with respect to significant defects, if any, before proceeding with operations. Anadarko believes the title to its leasehold properties is good, defensible, and customary with practices in the oil and gas industry, subject to such exceptions that, in the opinion of legal counsel for the Company, do not materially detract from the use of such properties.
Leasehold properties owned by the Company are subject to royalty, overriding royalty, and other outstanding interests customary in the industry. The properties may be subject to burdens such as liens incident to operating agreements, current taxes, development obligations under oil and gas leases and other encumbrances, easements, and restrictions. Anadarko does not believe any of these burdens will materially interfere with its use of these properties.

In October 2011, the Company and BP entered into a settlement agreement, mutual releases, and agreement to indemnify relating to the Deepwater Horizon events (Settlement Agreement). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Company is fully indemnified by BP against all claims, causes of action, losses, costs, expenses, liabilities, damages, or judgments of any kind arising out of the Deepwater Horizon events, related damage claims arising under OPA, NRD claims and assessment costs, and any claims arising under the OA. This indemnification is guaranteed by BPCNA and, in the event that the net worth of BPCNA declines below an agreed-on amount, BP p.l.c. has agreed to become the sole guarantor.
Any failure or inability on the part of BP to satisfy its indemnification obligations under the Settlement Agreement, or on the part of BPCNA or BP p.l.c. to satisfy their respective guarantee obligations, could subject us to significant monetary liability beyond the terms of the Settlement Agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In November2012, BP settled all criminal and securities claims brought by the United States against BP, with BP agreeing to pay $4.0 billion over five years to the U.S. Department of Justice with respect to the criminal claims and further agreeing to pay another $525million over three years to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with respect to the securities claims. In addition, in September2014, the U.S. District Court in New Orleans, Louisiana (Louisiana District Court) issued its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in the first phase of the Deepwater Horizon trial. The Louisiana District Court found that BP is liable under general maritime law for the blowout, explosion, and oil spill and apportioned 67% of the fault to BP. BP is challenging certain of the Louisiana District Courts findings.
31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Furthermore, in certain instances we may be required to recognize a liability for amounts for which we are indemnified in advance of or in connection with recognizing a receivable from BP for the related indemnity payment. Any such liability recognition without collection of the offsetting receivable could adversely impact our results of operations, our financial condition, and our ability to make borrowings.
Under the Settlement Agreement, BP does not indemnify the Company against penalties and fines, punitive damages, shareholder derivative or securities laws claims, or certain other claims. The adverse resolution of any current or future proceeding related to the Deepwater Horizon events for which we are not indemnified by BP could subject us to significant monetary liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
Oil, natural-gas, and NGLs prices are volatile. A substantial or extended decline in the price of these commodities could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Prices for oil, natural gas, and NGLs can fluctuate widely. For example, daily settlement prices for New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) West Texas Intermediate oil ranged from a high of $107.26 per barrel to a low of $53.27 per barrel during 2014. Daily settlement prices for NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas ranged from a high of $6.15 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) to a low of $2.89 per MMBtu during 2014. Our revenues, operating results, cash flows from operations, capital budget, and future growth rates are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our oil, natural gas, and NGLs. The markets for oil, natural gas, and NGLs have been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile in the future. Factors influencing the prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:  domestic and worldwide supply of, and demand for, oil, natural gas, and NGLs  volatile trading patterns in the commodity-futures markets  cost of exploring for, developing, producing, transporting, and marketing oil, natural gas, and NGLs  level of global oil and natural-gas inventories  weather conditions  potential U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas, oil, condensate, or NGLs  ability of the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producing nations to agree to and maintain production levels  worldwide military and political environment, civil and political unrest in Africa and the Middle East, uncertainty or instability resulting from the escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities, or further acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere  effect of worldwide energy conservation and environmental protection efforts  price and availability of alternative and competing fuels  price and level of foreign imports of oil, natural gas, and NGLs  domestic and foreign governmental laws, regulations, and taxes  proximity to, and capacity of, natural-gas pipelines and other transportation facilities  general economic conditions worldwide The long-term effect of these and other factors on the prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs is uncertain. Prolonged or substantial declines in these commodity prices may have the following effects on our business:  adversely affecting our financial condition, liquidity, ability to finance planned capital expenditures, and results of operations  reducing the amount of oil, natural gas, and NGLs that we can produce economically  causing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  reducing our revenues, operating income, or cash flows  reducing the amounts of our estimated proved oil, natural-gas, and NGLs reserves  reducing the carrying value of our oil and natural-gas properties  reducing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil, natural-gas, and NGLsreserves  limiting our access to, or increasing the cost of, sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt Our domestic operations are subject to governmental risks that may impact our operations.
Our domestic operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and are subject to complex federal, provincial, regional, state, tribal, local, and other laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, permitting, changes in taxes, deductions, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering-rate controls, hydraulic fracturing, and environmental protection regulations. To conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals, and certificates from various federal, provincial, regional, state, tribal, and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. Our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws, including environmental and tax laws and regulations, are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. For example, from time to time, legislation has been proposed that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows related to the following:  Ozone Standards.
In December2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published proposed regulations to revise the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone, recommending a standard between 65 to 70 parts per billion (ppb) for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards protective of public health and public welfare. The current primary and secondary ozone standards are set at 75 ppb. The EPA is also taking comments on whether a 60 ppb standard should be established for the primary standard or whether the existing 75 ppb standard should be retained. If adopted, compliance with such regulations may require the Company to install new equipment to further control emissions and may also cause permitting delays. The EPA currently expects to issue a final rule by October1,2015.
Reduction of Methane Emissions.
In January2015, the Obama Administration announced that the EPA is expected to propose in the summer of 2015 and finalize in 2016 new regulations that will regulate methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. The Obama Administration seeks to reduce methane emissions from new and modified infrastructure and equipment in the oil and gas sector, including the drilling of new wells, by up to 45% from 2012 levels by 2025.
Climate Change.
A number of state and regional efforts exist that are aimed at tracking or reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In addition, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations that restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act. Also, certain of our operations are subject to EPA rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore and offshore production sources. We may be required to install best available control technology to limit emissions of GHGs from any new or significantly modified facilities that we may seek to construct in the future if they would otherwise emit large volumes of GHGs together with other criteria pollutants.
Deficit Reduction or Tax Reform.
Congress may undertake significant deficit reduction or comprehensive tax reform in the coming year. Proposals include provisions that would, if enacted, (i)eliminate the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs, (ii)eliminate the manufacturing deduction for oil and gas qualified production activities, and (iii)eliminate accelerated depreciation for tangible property.
33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Changes in laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing or other oil and gas operations could increase our costs of doing business, impose additional operating restrictions or delays, and adversely affect our production.
Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice used to stimulate production of natural gas and oil from dense subsurface rock formations such as shales. We routinely apply hydraulic-fracturing techniques in many of our U.S. onshore oil and natural-gas drilling and completion programs. The process involves the injection of water, sand, and additives under pressure into a targeted subsurface formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.
Hydraulic fracturing is regulated by state oil and natural-gas commissions. However, several federal agencies have also asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has issued final Clean Air Act regulations governing performance standards for the oil and gas industry; announced its intent to propose in early 2015 effluent limit guidelines that wastewater from shale gas extraction operations must meet before discharging to a treatment plant; and issued in May2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, in May 2013, the Bureau of Land Management issued a revised proposed rule containing disclosure requirements and other mandates for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands and the agency is expected to promulgate a final rule in early 2015. Also, from time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In the event that a new, federal level of legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic-fracturing process is adopted in areas where we operate, we may incur additional costs to comply with such federal requirements that may be significant in nature, and also could become subject to additional permitting requirements and experience added delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities.
Certain states in which we operate, including Colorado, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Texas, and Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, or well-construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or prohibit these operations completely. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. For example, in exchange for the withdrawal of several initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas operations proposed for inclusion on the Colorado state ballot in November2014, the governor of Colorado created the Task Force on State and Local Regulation of Oil and Gas Operations (Task Force) in September2014 to make recommendations to the state legislature regarding the responsible development of Colorados oil and gas resources. Although it is early in the process, it is possible that, as a result of the Task Forces recommendations, Colorado could adopt new policies or legislation relating to oil and natural-gas operations, including measures that would give local governments in Colorado greater authority to limit hydraulic fracturing and other oil and natural-gas operations or require greater distances between well sites and occupied structures. In the event state or local restrictions or prohibitions are adopted in areas where we conduct operations, such as the Wattenberg field in Colorado, we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or we may experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and possibly be limited or precluded in the drilling of wells or in the amounts that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves. Such costs, delays, restrictions, or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
In addition to asserting regulatory authority, a number of federal entities are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. In April2012, President Obama issued an executive order that established a working group for the purpose of coordinating policy, information sharing, and planning among federal agencies and offices regarding unconventional natural-gas production, including hydraulic fracturing. In December2012, the EPA issued an initial progress report on a study begun in 2011 of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater, with a draft final report expected to be issued for peer review and comment in early 2015. These studies and initiatives, or any future studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur efforts to further regulate hydraulic fracturing.
34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility.
Our total debt was $15.1billion at December31,2014 . We also have various commitments for leases, drilling contracts, derivative contracts, firm transportation, and purchase obligations for services and products. Our financial commitments could have important consequences to our business including, but not limited to, the following:  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures, to engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or to otherwise fully realize the value of our assets and opportunities because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt or to comply with any restrictive terms of our debt  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and/or fewer financial commitments Additionally, the credit agreements governing our $3.0 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our $2.0 billion 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility contain a number of customary covenants, including a financial covenant requiring maintenance of a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 65%, and limitations on certain secured indebtedness, sale-and-leaseback transactions, and mergers and other fundamental changes. Our ability to meet such covenants may be affected by events beyond our control.
A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.
As of December31,2014 , our long-term debt was rated BBB with a stable outlook by Standard and Poors (S&P), BBB- with a positive outlook by Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and Baa3 with a positive outlook by Moodys Investors Service (Moodys). In February2015, Moodys raised our long-term debt rating to Baa2 and changed the outlook to stable. Although we are not aware of any current plans of S&P, Fitch, or Moodys to lower their respective ratings on our debt, we cannot be assured that our credit ratings will not be downgraded. A downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our cost of capital or our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy. If our credit ratings were downgraded, it could affect our ability to raise debt in the public debt markets and the cost of that new debt could be much higher than our outstanding debt. In addition, a downgrade could affect the Companys requirements to provide financial assurance of its performance under certain contractual arrangements and derivative agreements.See Note11Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form10-K.
Our proved reserves are estimates. Any material inaccuracies in our reserves estimates or assumptions underlying our reserves estimates could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many factors beyond our control that could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated. The reserves information included or incorporated by reference in this report represents estimates prepared by our internal engineers. The procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants; however, no reserves audit was conducted by these consultants. Estimation of reserves is not an exact science. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural-gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, any of which may cause actual results to vary considerably from these estimates. These factors and assumptions may include, but are not limited to, the following:  historical production from an area compared with production from similar producing areas  assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and court rulings  assumptions concerning future oil and natural-gas prices, future operating costs, and capital expenditures  estimates of future severance and excise taxes, workover costs, and remedial costs 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Estimates of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of expected future net cash flows prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues, and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and the variance may be material. The discounted cash flows included in this report should not be construed as the fair value of the estimated oil, natural-gas, and NGLs reserves attributable to our properties. The estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on the average beginning-of-month prices during the 12-month period for the respective year. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from the SEC regulation-compliant prices used for purposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves.
Failure to replace reserves may negatively affect our business.
Our future success depends on our ability to find, develop, or acquire additional oil and natural-gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Our proved reserves generally decline when reserves are produced, unless we conduct successful exploration or development activities, acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. We may be unable to find, develop, or acquire additional reserves on an economic basis. Furthermore, if oil and natural-gas prices increase, our costs for finding or acquiring additional reserves could also increase.
Certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.
A portion of our leasehold acreage is currently undeveloped. Unless production in sufficient quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. If our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. Our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based on various factors: drilling results, oil and natural-gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals.
Future economic, business, or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.
During the last few years, concerns over inflation, potential default on U.S. debt, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, and uncertainties with regard to European sovereign debt, have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. Concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. Continued concerns could cause demand for petroleum products to diminish or stagnate, which could impact the price at which we can sell our oil, natural gas, and NGLs; affect the ability of our vendors, suppliers, and customers to continue operations; and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.
Our results of operations could be adversely affected by goodwill impairments.
As a result of mergers and acquisitions, we had approximately $5.6 billion of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December31,2014 . Goodwill must be tested at least annually for impairment, and more frequently when circumstances indicate likely impairment. Goodwill is considered impaired to the extent that its carrying amount exceeds its implied fair value. Various factors could lead to an impairment of goodwill, such as the Companys inability to replace the value of its depleting asset base, difficulty or potential delays in obtaining drilling permits, or other adverse events, such as lower oil and natural-gas prices, which could reduce the fair value of the associated reporting unit. An impairment of goodwill could have a substantial negative effect on our profitability.
36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We are subject to complex laws and regulations relating to environmental protection that can adversely affect the cost, manner, and feasibility of doing business.
Our operations and properties are subject to numerous federal, provincial, regional, state, tribal, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing the release of pollutants or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations govern the following, among other things:  issuance of permits in connection with exploration, drilling, production, and midstream activities  protection of endangered species  amounts and types of emissions and discharges  generation, management, and disposition of waste materials  offshore oil and gas operations and decommissioning of abandoned facilities  reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites  remediation of contaminated sites In addition, these laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for our failure to comply or for any contamination resulting from our operations, including the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of delays in the development of projects; and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in a particular area. Future environmental laws and regulations, such as the restriction against emission of pollutants from previously unregulated activities or the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we operate, such as the sage grouse, may negatively impact our operations. The cost of satisfying these requirements may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves. For a description of certain environmental proceedings in which we are involved, see Legal Proceedings under Item 3 and Note17Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form10-K.
We are vulnerable to risks associated with our offshore operations that could negatively impact our operations and financial results.
We conduct offshore operations in the Gulf of Mexico, Mozambique, Ghana, Brazil, Colombia, Cte dIvoire, Kenya, Liberia, New Zealand, and other countries. Our operations and financial results could be significantly impacted by conditions in some of these areas because we are vulnerable to certain unique risks associated with operating offshore, including those relating to the following:  hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions  oilfield service costs and availability  compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations  terrorist attacks, such as piracy  remediation and other costs and regulatory changes resulting from oil spills or releases of hazardous materials  failure of equipment or facilities In addition, we conduct some of our exploration in deep waters (greater than 1,000feet) where operations and decommissioning activities are more difficult and costly than in shallower waters. The deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as international deepwater locations, lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in its shallower waters. As a result, deepwater operations may require significant time between a discovery and the time that we can market our production, thereby increasing the risk involved with these operations.
37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Further, production of reserves from reservoirs in the Gulf of Mexico generally declines more rapidly than from reservoirs in many other producing regions of the world. This results in recovery of a relatively higher percentage of reserves from properties in the Gulf of Mexico during the initial few years of production and, as a result, our reserves replacement needs from new prospects may be greater there than for our operations elsewhere. Also, our revenues and return on capital will depend significantly on prices prevailing during these relatively short production periods.
Additional domestic and international deepwater drilling laws, regulations, and other restrictions; delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration and oil spill-response plans; and other related developments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
In response to the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, each agencies of the U.S. Department of the Interior, imposed new and more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters. Compliance with these new and more stringent rules and regulations, in addition to uncertainties or inconsistencies in current decisions and rulings by governmental agencies, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development, and oil spill-response plans, and possible additional regulatory initiatives could adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts. Among other adverse impacts, these additional measures could delay or disrupt our operations, increase the risk of expired leases due to the time required to develop new technology, result in increased supplemental bonding and costs, and limit activities in certain areas, or cause us to incur penalties, fines, or shut-in production at one or more of our facilities. If similar material spill events were to occur in the future, the United States or other countries could elect to again issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, may from time to time issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and gas exploration and development. We cannot predict with any certainty the full impact of any new laws or regulations on our drilling operations or on the cost or availability of insurance to cover the risks associated with such operations.
Further, the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (as well as international deepwater locations) lacks the degree of physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. Therefore, despite the Companys oil spill-response capabilities, it may be difficult for us to quickly or effectively execute any contingency plans related to future events similar to the Deepwater Horizon incident.
The matters described above, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
We operate in foreign countries and are subject to political, economic, and other uncertainties.
Our operations outside the United States are based primarily in Algeria, Brazil, Colombia, Cte dIvoire, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Mozambique, and New Zealand. As a result, we face political and economic risks andother uncertainties with respect to our international operations. These risks may include the following, among other things:  loss of revenue, property, and equipment or delays in operations as a result of hazards such as expropriation, war, piracy, acts of terrorism, insurrection, civil unrest, and other political risks, including tension and confrontations among political parties  transparency issues in general and, more specifically, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption compliance laws and issues  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  unilateral renegotiation of contracts by governmental entities  redefinition of international boundaries or boundary disputes  difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  foreign-exchange restrictions  international monetary fluctuations and changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar as compared to the currencies of other countries in which we conduct business For example, Ghana and Cte dIvoire are engaged in a dispute regarding the international maritime and land boundaries between the two countries. As a result, Cte dIvoire claims to be entitled to the maritime area which covers a portion of the Deepwater Tano Block where we are developing the TEN complex. In the event Cte dIvoire is successful in its maritime border claims, this development could be materially impacted. Also, Venezuela and Guyana are in a dispute regarding their maritime and land borders in which the two countries have initiated a dialogue. We are unable to ascertain the full impact of this border dispute on future operations in Guyana.
Outbreaks of civil and political unrest and acts of terrorism have occurred in countries in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, including countries where we conduct operations. Continued or escalated civil and political unrest and acts of terrorism in the countries in which we operate could result in our curtailing operations.In the event that countries in which we operate experience civil or political unrest or acts of terrorism, especially in events where such unrest leads to an unseating of the established government, our operations in such countries could be materially impaired.
Our international operations may also be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by laws, policies, and regulations of the United States affecting foreign trade and taxation, including U.S. trade sanctions.
Realization of any of the factors listed above could materially and adversely affect the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Our commodity-price risk-management and trading activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks.
To the extent that we engage in commodity-price risk-management activities to protect our cash flows from commodity-price declines, we may be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. In addition, our commodity-price risk-management and trading activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the following occur:  our production is less than the notional volumes  a widening of price basis differentials occurs between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the derivative arrangement  the counterparties to our hedging or other price-risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements  a sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil, natural-gas, or NGLs prices The enactment of derivatives legislation, and the promulgation of regulations pursuant thereto, could have an adverse effect on the Companys ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity-price, interest-rate, and other risks associated with its business.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), enacted in 2010, requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market including swap clearing and trade execution requirements. While many rules and regulations have been promulgated and are already in effect, other rules and regulations, including the proposed margin rules, position limits, and commodity clearing requirements, remain to be finalized or effectuated, and therefore, the impact of those rules and regulations on us is uncertain at this time.
39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements New or modified rules, regulations, or legal requirements may increase the cost and impact the availability to our counterparties of their hedging and swap positions that they can make available to us, and may further require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivative activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties. In addition, for uncleared swaps, the CFTC or federal banking regulators may require end-users to enter into credit support documentation or post margin collateral. Any changes in the regulations of swaps may result in certain market participants deciding to curtail or cease their derivative activities.
The Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder, could (i) significantly increase the cost, or decrease the liquidity, of energy-related derivatives we use to hedge against commodity-price fluctuations (including through requirements to post collateral), (ii) materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, (iii) reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, and (iv) increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and applicable rules and regulations, our cash flow may become more volatile and less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.
In addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent the Company transacts with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, it may become subject to such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.
Deterioration in the credit or equity markets could adversely affect us.
We have exposure to different counterparties. For example, we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, investment funds, and other institutions. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty. Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. We have exposure to these financial institutions through our derivative transactions. In addition, if any lender under our credit facility is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lenders commitment under our credit facility. Moreover, to the extent that purchasers of the Companys production rely on access to the credit or equity markets to fund their operations, there is a risk that those purchasers could default in their contractual obligations to the Company if such purchasers were unable to access the credit or equity markets for an extended period of time.
We are not insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.
Our business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production, gathering, processing, and transportation of oil and gas, including blowouts; cratering and fire; environmental hazards, such as gasleaks, oil spills, pipeline and vessel ruptures, and releases of chemicals or otherhazardous substances, any of which could result in damage to, or destruction of, oil and natural-gas wells or formations, production facilities, and other property; pollution or other environmental damage; and injury to persons. For protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage, including insurance coverage for certain physical damage, blowout/loss of control of a well, comprehensive general liability, aviation liability, and workers compensation and employers liability. However, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover us against 100% of potential losses arising as a result of the foregoing, and for certain risks, such as political risk, business interruption, war, terrorism, and piracy, for which we have limited or no coverage. In addition, we are not insured against all risks in all aspects of our business, such as hurricanes. The occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the completion of and commencement of production from development projects.
We are involved in several large development projects and the completion of those projects may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion dates. Key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of such projects include the following:  project approvals by joint-venture partners  timely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies or legislative and other governmental approvals  weather conditions  availability of qualified personnel  civil and political environment of, and existing infrastructure in, the country or region in which the project is located  manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment  commercial arrangements for pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons Delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the forward-looking statements related to large development projects and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
The oil and gas exploration and production industry is very competitive, and some of our exploration and production competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do.
The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production. Our competitors include national oil companies, major oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, individual producers, gas marketers, and major pipeline companies, as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers. Some of our competitors may have greater and more diverse resources on which to draw than we do. If we are not successful in our competition for oil and gas reserves or in our marketing of production, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
The high cost or unavailability of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, and other oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
Our industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs of rigs, equipment, supplies, and personnel are substantially greater and their availability to us may be limited. Additionally, these services may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The high cost or unavailability of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, and other oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our drilling activities may not be productive.
Drilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural-gas reservoirs. The costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including the following:  unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  fires, explosions, blowouts, and surface cratering  marine risks such as capsizing, collisions, and hurricanes  difficulty identifying and retaining qualified personnel  title problems  other adverse weather conditions  shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment Certain of our future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. While all drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Because of the percentage of our capital budget devoted to high-risk exploratory projects, it is likely that we will continue to experience significant exploration and dry hole expenses.
We have limited influence over the activities on properties we do not operate.
Other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest. We have limited ability to influence the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital, lead to unexpected future costs, or adversely affect the timing of activities.
Our ability to sell our oil, natural gas, and NGLs production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation.
The marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline facilities and tanker transportation. If any pipelines or tankers become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport the oil, natural gas, and NGLs, which could increase our costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of the oil and gas.
42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.
As an oil and gas producer, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats such as attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. Our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities, and infrastructure may result in increased costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
While we have experienced cybersecurity attacks, we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. In addition, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate or remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control of Anadarko, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders.
Our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that may make a change of control of Anadarko difficult, even if it may be beneficial to our stockholders, including provisions governing the nomination and removal of directors, the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent and regulation of stockholders ability to bring matters for action before annual stockholder meetings, and the authorization given to our Board of Directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock.
In addition, Section203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.
We may reduce or cease to pay dividends on our common stock.
We can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at the current rate or at all. The amount of cash dividends, if any, to be paid in the future will depend on actions taken by our Board of Directors, as well as, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, levels of capital and exploration expenditures, future business prospects, expected liquidity needs, and other related matters that our Board of Directors deems relevant.
The loss of key members of our management team, or difficulty attracting and retaining experienced technical personnel, could reduce our competitiveness and prospects for future success.
The successful implementation of our strategies and handling of other issues integral to our future success will depend, in part, on our experienced management team. The loss of key members of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business. We do not carry key man insurance. Our exploratory drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced explorationists, engineers, and other professionals. Competition for such professionals is intense. If we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.

43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Item 3.Legal Proceedings GENERAL The Company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits and is involved in governmental proceedings and regulatory controls arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, personal injury claims; title disputes; tax disputes; royalty claims; contract claims; contamination claims relating to oil and gas production, transportation, and processing; and environmental claims, including claims involving assets owned by acquired companies and claims involving assets previously sold to third parties and no longer a part of the Companys current operations. Anadarko is also subject to various environmental-remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state, and local laws and regulations. While the ultimate outcome and impact on the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, after consideration of recorded expense and liability accruals, management believes that the resolution of pending proceedingswill not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or cashflows.
In September2013, Anadarko received a Notice of Proposed Penalty Assessment from the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) as the result of an incident that occurred in February2012 relating to a drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico. In the notice, BSEE alleged several violations of certain offshore operational requirements. Anadarko disputed many of the allegations and in October2014 received a Revised Final Reviewing Officers Decision from BSEE for a penalty of $70,000.
In June2014, the EPA alleged that Anadarko was not in compliance with a consent decree entered into by the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado on March27,2008 to resolve certain Clean Air Act violations in Colorado and Utah. Specifically, the EPA alleged violations of the consent decree at three of Anadarkos compressor station facilities located in Utah. In November 2014, Anadarko entered into a joint stipulation with the EPA and agreed to pay a penalty of $599,000.
WGR Operating, LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is currently in negotiations with the EPA concerning enforcement for alleged noncompliance with the leak detection and repair requirements of the Clean Air Act at its Granger, Wyoming facilities. Although management cannot predict the outcome of settlement discussions, it is likely a resolution of this matter will result in a fine or penalty in excess of $100,000.

Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms Anadarko and Company refer to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
OVERVIEW Anadarko met or exceeded its key operational objectives in 2014 . The Company increased sales volumes per day byapproximately 8% over 2013 and added 502million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) of proved reserves. The Company ended 2014 with $7.4 billion of cash on hand, full availability of its $5.0billion senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in September 2015 ($5.0billion Facility), and access to credit and capital markets as needed.
In January 2015, the Company paid $5.2 billion after the settlement agreement resolving all claims asserted in the Tronox Adversary Proceeding became effective and replaced the $5.0billion Facility with two new unsecured credit facilities. The Company paid the settlement using cash on hand and borrowings. Management believes that the Company is positioned to continue to satisfy its operational objectives and capital commitments with cash on hand, available borrowing capacity, and cash flows fromoperations.
Mission and Strategy Anadarkos mission is to deliver a competitive and sustainable rate of return to shareholders by developing, acquiring, and exploring for oil and natural-gas resources vital to the worlds health and welfare.

In the second quarter of 2013, the Company reversed the $56million tax indemnification liability associated with the 2006 sale of the Companys Canadian subsidiary. The indemnity was reversed as a result of certain changes to Canadian tax laws.
2013 vs. 2012 During 2013, the Company recognized a decommissioning charge of $117 million and a restoration liability of $50 million, partially offset by the 2013 reversal of the $56million tax indemnification liability associated with the 2006 sale of the Companys Canadian subsidiary.
millions 2014 2013 2012 Tronox-related contingent loss $ 4,360 $ 850 $ (250 ) In April 2014, Anadarko and Kerr-McGee Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, Kerr-McGee) entered into a settlement agreement for $5.15billion resolving all claims asserted in the Tronox Adversary Proceeding. Anadarko recognized Tronox-related contingent losses of $4.3 billion in 2014, $850 million in 2013, and reversed $250million in 2012 associated with the Tronox-related contingent loss recognized in 2011. In addition, Anadarkorecognized settlement-related interest expense of$60million during 2014. An aggregate Tronox-relatedcontingent liability of $5.2billion was included on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December31,2014 . In January 2015, the Company paid $5.2billion after the settlement agreement became effective.

64 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Income Tax Expense millions except percentages 2014 2013 2012 Income tax expense (benefit) $ 1,617 $ 1,165 $ 1,120 Effective tax rate 2,994 % 55 % 31 % 2014 The increase from the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate was primarily attributable to net changes in uncertain tax positions related to the settlement agreement associated with the Tronox Adversary Proceeding, changes in other uncertain tax positions, the tax impact from foreign operations, Algerian exceptional profits taxes, and the non-deductible contingent CWA-penalty accrual. For additional information on income tax rates, see Note18Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
In 2013, the Company recognized a deferred tax benefit of $274million related to the $850million loss with respect to the Tronox-related contingent liability. In 2014, the Company recognized an additional deferred tax benefit of $316million related to the additional $4.360billion loss with respect to the Tronox-related contingent liability. See Note17Contingencies Tronox Litigation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
2013 The increase from the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate was primarily attributable to the tax impact from foreign operations, non-deductible Algerian exceptional profits tax, and deferred tax adjustments.
2012 The decrease from the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate was primarily attributable to the non-taxable resolution of the Algeria exceptional profits tax dispute. This amount was partially offset by the tax impact from foreign operations and non-deductible Algerian exceptional profits tax.
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests The Companys net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $187 million for the year ended December31,2014 , $140million for 2013 , and $54million for 2012 , was related to public ownership interests in WES and WGP. Public ownership of WES was 55% at December31,2014 , 56.4% at December31,2013 , and 51.8% at December31,2012 . In December 2012, WGP completed its IPO of approximately 20million common units representing limited partner interests in WGP at a price of $22.00 per common unit. During 2014, Anadarko sold approximately 6 million WGP common units to the public, raising net proceeds of $335 million . Public ownership of WGP was 11.7% at December31,2014 , and was 9% at December31,2013 and 2012 . See Note9Noncontrolling Interests in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form10-K.
65 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements OPERATING RESULTS Segment AnalysisAdjusted EBITDAX To assess the performance of Anadarkos operating segments, the chief operating decision maker analyzes Adjusted EBITDAX. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDAX as income (loss) before income taxes; exploration expense; DD&A; impairments; interest expense; total (gains) losses on derivatives, net, less net cash from settlement of commodity derivatives; and certain items not related to the Companys normal operations, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. During the periods presented, items not related to the Companys normal operations included Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs, Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement, Tronox-related contingent loss, and certain other nonoperating items included in other (income) expense, net. The Companys definition of Adjusted EBITDAX, which is not a GAAP measure, excludes exploration expense as it is not an indicator of operating efficiency for a given reporting period. However, exploration expense is monitored by management as part of costs incurred in exploration and development activities. Similarly, DD&A and impairments are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX as a measure of segment operating performance because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. Adjusted EBITDAX also excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating results without regard to Anadarkos financing methods or capital structure. Total (gains) losses on derivatives, net, less net cash from settlement of commodity derivatives are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX because these (gains) losses are not considered a measure of asset operatingperformance. Finally, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is excluded from the Companys measure of Adjusted EBITDAX because it represents earnings that are not attributable to the Companys common stockholders.
Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX provides information useful in assessing the Companys financial condition and results of operations and that Adjusted EBITDAX is a widely accepted financial indicator of a companys ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures, and make distributions to stockholders. Adjusted EBITDAX as defined by Anadarko may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and other performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as operating income or cash flows from operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes certain items that affect net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of Anadarkos results as reported under GAAP. Below is a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX to income (loss) before income taxes, and consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX by reporting segment.

These increases were partially offset by lower oil prices, and higher oil and gas transportation expenses and other taxes, which increased as a result of higher sales volumes.
2013 vs. 2012 The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX was primarily due to higher sales volumes for all products and higher natural-gas prices, partially offset by lower oil and NGLs prices and losses on divestitures primarily related to the Pinedale/Jonah assets in Wyoming.
Midstream 2014 vs. 2013 The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX was primarily due to higher gathering and processing revenue associated with higher volumes and increased natural-gas prices, partially offset by higher processing expenses primarily due to increased volumes.
2013 vs. 2012 The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX was primarily due to higher gathering revenue as a result of increased volumes.
67 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Marketing 2014 vs. 2013 The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX resulted from lower marketing margins and higher transportation expenses.
2013 vs. 2012 The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX resulted from higher transportation expenses due to increased third-party volumes and increased demand fees, partially offset by higher margins primarily associated with natural-gas and NGLs sales.
Other and Intersegment Eliminations Other and intersegment eliminations consists primarily of corporate costs, income from hard minerals investments and royalties, and net cash received in settlement of commodity derivatives.
2014 vs. 2013 The Adjusted EBITDAX in 2014 was relatively flat compared to the prior year.
2013 vs. 2012 The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX was primarily due to a decrease in net cash received in settlement of commodity derivatives in 2013, partially offset by 2012 expense associated with the change in the fair value of the general partner UARs in connection with the WGP IPO. The UARs were awarded in prior years to certain officers of the general partner of WES, pursuant to the WGH Equity Incentive Plan.
Proved Reserves Anadarko is focused on growth and profitability, and reserves replacement is a key to growth. Future profitability partially depends on commodity prices and the cost of finding and developing oil and gas reserves. Reserves growth can be achieved through successful exploration and development drilling, improved recovery, or acquisition of producing properties. For reserves information, see Oil and Gas Properties and ActivitiesProved Reserves under Items 1 and 2 of this Form 10-K and the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
68 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Anadarko generates cash needed to fund capital expenditures, debt-service obligations, and dividend payments primarily from operating activities, and enters into debt and equity transactions to maintain its desired capital structure and to finance acquisition opportunities. The Company has a variety of funding sources available, including cash on hand, an asset portfolio that provides ongoing cash-flow-generating capacity, opportunities for liquidity enhancement through divestitures and joint-venture arrangements that reduce future capital expenditures, commercial paper, and the Companys New Credit Facilities. In addition, as of January 2014, an effective registration statement is available to Anadarko covering the sale of up to 40 million WGP common units. These common units were issued to Anadarko in connection with WGPs IPO in December 2012. During 2014, the Company sold 6 million WGP common units and at December31,2014 , the Company had 34 million units available for sale.
During 2014 , the primary source for funding of capital investments was cash flows from operating activities. The Company continuously monitors its liquidity needs, coordinates its capital expenditure program with its expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule, and evaluates available funding alternatives in light of current and expected conditions.
At December31,2014 , Anadarko had no scheduled debt maturities during the next year. Anadarkos Zero-Coupon Senior Notes due 2036 (Zero Coupons) can be put to the Company in October of each year, in whole or in part, for the then-accreted value, which will be $796 million at the next put date in October 2015. The Zero Coupons are classified as long-term debt on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets, as the Company has the ability and intent to refinance these obligations using long-term debt. See Note12Debt and Interest Expense in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form10-K for additional information on the Zero Coupons. Anadarkos scheduled 2016 debt maturities are $1.8 billion, exclusive of the Zero Coupons.
Management believes that the Companys liquidity position, asset portfolio, and operating and financial performance provide the necessary financial flexibility to fund the Companys current and long-term operations.
Tronox Adversary Proceeding Settlement Payment In April 2014,Anadarko and Kerr-McGee entered into a settlement agreement to resolve all claims asserted in the Tronox Adversary Proceeding for $5.15billion. In addition, the Company agreed to pay interest on the above amount from April3,2014, through the payment of the settlement, with an annual interest rate of 1.5% for the first 180 days and 1.5% plus the one-month LIBOR thereafter. In January 2015, the Company paid $5.2 billion after the settlement agreement became effective. See Note17Contingencies Tronox Litigation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form10-K.
69 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Revolving Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Program During 2014, the Company maintained the $5.0billion Facility maturing in September 2015. Obligations incurred under the $5.0 billion Facility, as well as obligations Anadarko has to lenders or their affiliates pursuant to certain derivative instruments as discussedin Note11Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form10-K, were guaranteed by certain of the Companys wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, and were secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in certain exploration and production assets located in the United States and 65% of the capital stock of certain wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. During 2014, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the $5.0 billion Facility.
In June2014, Anadarko entered into a $3.0billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (Five-Year Facility), which is expandable to $4.0billion, and a $2.0billion 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility (364-Day Facility). The New Credit Facilities replaced the $5.0billion Facility upon satisfaction of certain conditions, including the January2015 settlement payment related to the Tronox Adversary Proceeding. Under the New Credit Facilities, the Companys derivative counterparties no longer maintain security interests in any of the Companys assets. As a result, the Company may be required from time to time to post collateral of cash or letters of credit based on the negotiated terms of the individual derivative agreements.
In January 2015, the Company borrowed $1.5 billion under the 364-Day Facility. Borrowings under the New Credit Facilities generally bear interest under one of two rate options, at Anadarkos election, using either LIBOR (or Euro Interbank Offered Rate in the case of borrowings under the Five-Year Facility denominated in Euro) or an alternate base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 1.65% for the Five-Year Facility and 0.00% to 1.675% for the 364-Day Facility. The applicable margin will vary depending on Anadarkos credit ratings.
In January 2015, the Company initiated a commercial paper program, which allows a maximum of $3.0 billion of unsecured commercial paper notes. The maturities of the commercial paper notes vary, but may not exceed 397days. The commercial paper notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are issued either at a discounted price to their principal face value or will bear interest at varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. Such discounted price or interest amounts are dependent on market conditions and the ratings assigned to the commercial paper program by credit rating agencies at the time of issuance of the commercial paper notes.
Financial Covenants The $5.0billion Facility contained various customary covenants with which Anadarko had to comply, including, but not limited to, limitations on incurrence of indebtedness, liens on assets, and asset sales. Anadarko was also required to maintain, at the end of each quarter, (i)a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of no more than 4.5to 1.0 (relative to Consolidated EBITDAX for the most recent period of four calendar quarters), (ii)a ratio of Current Assets to Current Liabilities of no less than 1.0 to 1.0, and (iii)a Collateral Coverage Ratio of no less than 1.75to 1.0, in each case, as defined in the $5.0billion Facility. The Collateral Coverage Ratio was the ratio of an annually redetermined value of pledged assets to outstanding loans under the $5.0billion Facility. Additionally, to borrow from the $5.0billion Facility, the Collateral Coverage Ratio had to be no less than 1.75to 1.0 after giving pro forma effect to the requested borrowing.
The covenants contained in certain of the Companys credit agreements provide for a maximum Anadarko debt-to-capitalization ratio of 67%. The covenants do not specifically restrict the payment of dividends; however, the impact of dividends paid on the Companys debt-to-capitalization ratio must be considered to ensure covenant compliance. At December31,2014 , Anadarko was in compliance with all financial covenants.
The New Credit Facilities contain certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant requiring maintenance of a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 65%, and limitations on certain secured indebtedness, sale-and-leaseback transactions, and mergers and other fundamental changes.
70 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements WES Funding Sources Anadarkos consolidated subsidiary, WES, uses cash flows from operations to fund ongoing operations (including capital investments in the ordinary course of business), service its debt, and make distributions to its equity holders. As needed, WES supplements cash generated from its operating activities with proceeds from debt or equity issuances or borrowings under its five-year $1.2billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF).
In February 2014, WES entered into the RCF, which amended and restated its then-existing $800 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The RCF matures in February 2019 and is expandable to a maximum of $1.5billion. Borrowings under the RCF bear interest at (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.975%to1.45%, depending on WESs credit rating, or (ii)the greatest of (a)the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate, (b)the Federal Funds EffectiveRate plus 0.50%, or (c)one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.45%. At December31,2014 , WES was in compliance with all covenants contained in itsRCF, had outstanding borrowings under its RCF of $510 million at an interest rate of 1.47% , and had available borrowing capacity of approximately $677 million ($1.2 billion capacity, less $510 million of outstanding borrowings and $13 million of outstanding letters of credit).
In August 2014, WES filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission authorizing the issuance of up to an aggregate of $500 million of common units, in amounts, at prices, and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of the offerings.
Insurance Coverage and Other Indemnities Anadarko maintains property and casualty insurance that includes coverage for physical damage to the Companys properties, blowout/control of a well, restoration and redrill, sudden and accidental pollution, third-party liability, workers compensation and employers liability, and other risks. Anadarkos insurance coverage includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, the Companys insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the Company against liability or loss from all potential consequences and damages.
The Companys current insurance coverage includes (a) $400 million per occurrence from Oil Insurance Limited (OIL) for physical damage to Anadarkos properties on a replacement cost basis, blowout/control of well, redrill, and sudden and accidental pollution; (b) $700 million per occurrence from the commercial markets for the items described in item (a) above, which is in excess of the OIL coverage and which follows the form of OIL coverage with certain exceptions; (c)$400million from the commercial markets, which scales to Anadarkos working interest, for third-party liabilities including sudden and accidental pollution and aviation liability; and (d) $275 million for aircraft liability (in addition to the third-party liability limits described in item (c) above). Anadarko does not carry significant coverage for loss of production income from any of the Companys facilities or for any losses that result from the effects of a named windstorm.
The Companys service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify Anadarko for injuries and death to employees of the service provider and subcontractors hired by the service provider as well as for propertydamage suffered by the service provider and its contractors. Also, these service agreements generally indemnify Anadarko for pollution originating from the equipment of any contractors or subcontractors hired by the service provider.
71 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Following is a discussion of significant sources and uses of cash flows for the three-year period ended December31,2014 . Forward-looking information related to the Companys liquidity and capital resources is discussed in Outlook that follows.
Sources of Cash Operating Activities Anadarkos cash flows from operating activities in 2014 was $8.5 billion compared to $8.9billion in 2013 and $8.3billion in 2012 . Cash flows from operating activities for 2014 decreased year over year due to $730million of cash received in 2013 associated with the Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement, a $520million income tax payment in 2014 associated with the Companys divestiture of a 10% working interest in Offshore Area 1 in Mozambique, lower average oil and NGLs prices, lower natural-gas volumes, higher operating expenses, and the unfavorable impact of changes in working capital items. These decreases were substantially offset by higher average natural-gas prices, higher sales volumes for oil and NGLs, and net cash received in settlement of commodity derivative instruments. Cash flows from operating activities for 2013 increased year over year primarily due to higher sales volumes, higher average natural-gas prices, and the favorable impact of changes in working capital items. These increases were partially offset by lower average oil and NGLs prices and a decrease in cash collected in 2013 associated with the Algeria exceptional profits tax receivable.
One of the primary sources of variability in the Companys cash flows from operating activities is fluctuation in commodity prices, the impact of which Anadarko partially mitigates by entering into commodity derivatives. Sales-volume changes also impact cash flow, but historically have not been as volatile as commodity prices. Anadarkos cash flows from operating activities are also impacted by the costs related to continued operations and debt service.
Investing Activities Anadarko received pretax sales proceeds related to property divestiture transactions of $5.0billion in 2014 , $567million in 2013 , and $657million in 2012 . The increase in 2014 was primarily related to the Companys divestitures of a 10% working interest in Offshore Area 1 in Mozambique for $2.64billion, its Chinese subsidiary for $1.075 billion, its interest in the Pinedale/Jonah assets in Wyomingfor $581million, and its interest in the nonoperated Vito deepwater development, along with several surrounding exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, for $500million.
Financing Activities During 2014 , Anadarkos consolidated subsidiary, WES, borrowed $ 1.2 billion under its RCF primarily to partially fund its acquisitions of DBM and Anadarkos interests in Texas Express Pipeline LLC, Texas Express Gathering LLC, and Front Range Pipeline LLC and for other general partnership purposes, including the funding of capital expenditures. During 2014, WES completed public offerings of $100million aggregate principal amount of 2.600% Senior Notes due 2018 and $400million aggregate principal amount of 5.450% Senior Notes due 2044. These proceeds were used to repay borrowings under WESs RCF and for general partnership purposes. During 2014, WES issued approximately 10million common units to the public, raising total net proceeds of $691million . The proceeds were used to partially fund a portion of its DBM acquisition. WES used all the capacity to issue units under the $125 million continuous offering program as of the end of the third quarter of 2014.
During 2014, Anadarko sold approximately 6 million WGP common units to the public, raising net proceeds of $335million . Also, during 2014 , Anadarko completed public offerings of $625million aggregate principal amount of 3.450% Senior Notes due 2024 and$625million aggregate principal amount of 4.500% Senior Notes due 2044. These proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.
During 2013, WES borrowed $710 million under its RCF, primarily to fund the 2013 acquisitions of an interest in certain gas-gathering systems located in the Marcellus shale in north-central Pennsylvania and an intrastate pipeline in southwestern Wyoming, and for other general partnership purposes, including the funding of capital expenditures. During2013, WES also issued approximately 12 million common units to the public, including the $125 million continuous offering program. These offerings raised net proceedsof $725 million, which were primarily used to repay outstanding RCF borrowings and for other general partnership purposes, including funding of WESs capital expenditures. Also in 2013, WES completed a public offering of $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2.600%SeniorNotesdue 2018, with net proceeds from the offering used to repay outstanding borrowings under its RCF.
72 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements During 2012, WES borrowed $374 million under its RCF, primarily to fund the acquisition of certain midstream assets from Anadarko. Also during 2012, WES completed a public offering of $670 million aggregate principal amount of 4.000% Senior Notes due 2022 and issued five million common units to the public, raising net proceeds of $212million. Proceeds from these public offerings were used to repay outstanding RCF borrowings and for other general partnership purposes, including the funding of capital expenditures.
In December 2012, WGP completed its IPO of approximately 20million common units representing limited partner interests in WGP at a price of $22.00 per common unit, for net proceeds of $411 million. The proceeds were used by WGP to purchase common and general partner units in WES, and were in turn used by WES for general partnership purposes, including the funding of WES capital expenditures.
Uses of Cash Anadarko invests significant capital to develop, acquire, and explore for oil and natural-gas resources and to expand its midstream infrastructure. The Company also uses cash to fund ongoing operating costs, capital contributions to equity investments, debt repayments, and distributions to its shareholders.
CapitalExpenditures The following presents the Companys capital expenditures by category: millions 2014 2013 2012 Property acquisitions Exploration $ 283 $ 327 $ 239 Development 3 324  Exploration 1,711 1,970 2,064 Development 6,715 4,865 4,064 Total oil and gas costs incurred (1) 8,712 7,486 6,367 Less corporate acquisitions and non-cash property transactions (1 ) 6 32 Less asset retirement costs 347 180 98 Less geological and geophysical, exploration overhead, delay rentals expenses, and other expenses 543 430 401 Total oil and gas capital expenditures 7,823 6,870 5,836 Gathering, processing, and marketing and other (2) 1,433 1,653 1,475 Total capital expenditures (1) $ 9,256 $ 8,523 $ 7,311 _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) Oil and gas costs incurred represent costs related to finding and developing oil and gas reserves. Costs associated with activities of the Companys midstream and marketing reporting segments, LNG facilities costs, and other corporate activities are not included in oil and gas costs incurred. Capital expenditures represent additions to property and equipment excluding corporate acquisitions and non-cash property transactions and asset retirement costs. Capital expenditures and costs incurred are presented on an accrual basis. Additions to properties and equipment and dry hole costs on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows include certain adjustments that give effect to the timing of actual cash payments to provide a cash-basis presentation.
(2) Includes WES capital expenditures of $696 million in 2014 , $792 million in 2013 , and $529 million in 2012 .
The Companys capital expenditures increased by 9% for the year ended December31,2014 , due to increased development drilling primarily in the Wattenberg field of $663 million and in the Eagleford shale of $546 million and to a spar lease buyout of $110 million in the Gulf ofMexico. The increase in the Eagleford shale was primarily due to the 2013 development drilling being funded by a third party as a result of a carried-interest agreement that was fully funded in June 2013. These 2014 increases were partially offset by 2013 acquisitions of certain oil and gas properties and related assets in the Moxa area of Wyoming for $310million, primarily representing the fair value of the oil and gas properties acquired, and the acquisition of a 33.75% interest in gas-gathering systems located in the Marcellus shale in north-central Pennsylvania from a third party by WES for $135million.
73 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In the third quarter of 2014, the Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement that requires a third party to fund $442 million of Anadarkos capital costs in exchange for a 34% working interest in the Eaglebine development, located in Southeast Texas. The third-party funding is expected to cover Anadarkos future capital costs in the development through 2016. At December31,2014 , $22 million of the total $442million obligation had been funded.
The Companys capital spending increased by 17% for the year ended December31,2013 , due to development drilling onshore and offshore in the United States and acquisitions of oil and gas development properties and domestic onshore plants and gathering systems. In 2013, Anadarko exchanged certain oil and gas properties in the Wattenberg field with a third party to enhance the Companys core acreage position, in which $106 million of capital was incurred. Also in 2013, Anadarko acquired certain oil and gas properties and related assets in the Moxa area of Wyoming for $310million, primarily representing the fair value of the oil and gas properties acquired. In 2013, WES acquired a 33.75% interest in gas-gathering systems for $135million and an intrastate pipeline in southwestern Wyoming for $28million. These increases were offset by lower capital spending associated with decreased exploration drilling in West Africa and U.S. onshore and lower capital requirements to Anadarko related to development projects as a result of the carried-interest arrangements discussed below.
In 2013, the Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement that requires a third party to fund $860million of Anadarkos capital costs in exchange for a 12.75% working interest in the Heidelberg development, located in the Gulf of Mexico. The third-party funding is expected to cover the substantial majority of Anadarkos expected future capital costs through first production, which is expected to occur by mid-2016. At December31,2014 , $386 million of the total $860million obligation had been funded.
In the third quarter of 2012, the Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement that required a third party to fund $556million of Anadarkos capital costs in exchange for a 7.2% working interest in the Lucius development, located in the Gulf of Mexico. During the second quarter of 2014, as dictated by the Unitization and Participation Agreement, the working interests of all partners in the Lucius development were recalculated. As a result, Anadarkos working interest in the Lucius development was reduced from 27.8% to 23.8% and its capital expenditures were reduced by $44 million due to the re-determination. In addition, the working interest of the third party that participated in the carried-interest arrangement was reduced from 7.2% to 6.2%, which resulted in a reduction in the funding commitment from $556million to $476million. The funding commitment, which was fully funded during the second quarter of 2014, covered the substantial majority of the Companys capital costs through first production, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Pension Contributions During 2014 , the Company made contributions of $106 million to its funded pension plans, $15million to its unfunded pension plans, and $15 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans, which are included in Operating Activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Contributions to the funded pension plans decreased in 2014 as a result of favorable asset returns in 2013. Contributions made to the unfunded pension plans in 2014 were lower as a result of higher funding in 2013 related to the retirement of the Companys former Chief Executive Officer. The Company expects to contribute $5 million to its funded pension plans, $24 million to its unfunded pension plans, and $16 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans in 2015 .
During 2013 , the Company made contributions of $123million to its funded pension plans, $37million to its unfunded pension plans, and $14million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. The increase in contributions to the funded pension plans in 2013 resulted from a decrease in the discount rates used for funding purposes.
During 2012, the Company made contributions of $101million to its funded pension plans, $6million to its unfunded pension plans, and $19million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. The decrease in contributions to the funded pension plans in 2012 resulted from an increase in the discount rates used for fundingpurposes.
74 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Investments During 2014 , the Company made capital contributions of $167 million related to equity investments, which are included in Othernet under Investing Activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. These contributions were primarily associated with joint ventures for a gas processing plant, marine well containment, and pipelines. The Company made capital contributions related to equity investments of $396 million in 2013 , which were primarily associated with joint ventures to build the Front Range Pipeline, the Texas Express Pipeline, and two fractionation trains in Mont Belvieu. The Company made capital contributions related to equity investments of $205 million in 2012 .
Debt Retirements and Repayments During 2014 , Anadarko repaid $775 million of Senior Notes that matured during 2014 . Also, WES repaid $650 million of borrowings under its RCF with proceeds from debt and equity offerings, as discussed in Sources of Cash.
During 2013 , WES repaid $710 million of borrowings under its RCF with proceeds from debt and equity offerings. During 2012 , the Company repaid the entire $2.5billion of borrowings under its $5.0billion Facility, and retired $131million of 6.125% Senior Notes that matured in March2012 and $39million of 5.000% Senior Notes that matured in October2012. In addition, WES repaid $374million of borrowings under its RCF.
For additional information on the Companys debt instruments, such as transactions during the period, years of maturity, and interest rates, see Note12Debt and Interest Expense in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
Common Stock Dividends and Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest Owners Anadarko paid dividends to its common stockholders of $ 505 million in 2014 , $274million in 2013 , and $181million in 2012 . The Company increased the quarterly dividend paid to common stockholders from $0.09 per share to $0.18 per share during the third quarter of 2013. During the second quarter of 2014, Anadarko increased the quarterly dividend paid to common stockholders from $0.18 per share to $0.27per share. Anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders quarterly since becoming a public company in 1986. The amount of future dividends paid to Anadarko common stockholders will be determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and will depend on earnings, financial conditions, capital requirements, the effect a dividend payment would have on the Companys compliance with relevant financial covenants, and other factors.
WES distributed to its unitholders, other than Anadarko, an aggregate of $175million in 2014 , $130million in 2013 , and $100million in 2012 . WES has made quarterly distributions to its unitholders since its IPO in the second quarter of 2008 and has increased its distribution from $0.30 per common unit for the third quarter of 2008 to $0.70per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2014 (paid in February 2015 ).
WGP distributed to its unitholders, other than Anadarko, an aggregate of $24 million during 2014 and $12 million in 2013 . WGP declared a cash distribution of $0.31250 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2014 (to be paid in February 2015 ).
75 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Outlook Oil, natural-gas, and NGLs prices can have significant price fluctuations. The Companys revenues, operating results, cash flows from operations, capital spending, and future growth rates are highly dependent on the prices theCompany receives for oil, natural gas, and NGLs.During 2014, New York Mercantile Exchange West Texas Intermediate oil prices ranged from a high of $107.26 per barrel to a low of $53.27 per barrel at the end of 2014. The duration and magnitude of the decline in oil prices cannot be predicted.
The Company has a deep portfolio of investment opportunities and the financial strength and operational flexibility to move capital spending from areas focused on near-term production growth to areas focused on longer-term growth where anticipated returns are less sensitive to spot oil and natural-gas prices. The recent decline in oil prices may result in the Company significantly reducing its capital expenditures in 2015 versus 2014. The Company will continue to evaluate the oil and natural-gas price environments and may adjust its capital spending plans as prices fluctuate while maintaining the appropriate liquidity and financial flexibility.
The Company is committed to the execution of its worldwide exploration, appraisal, and development programs. The Company currently plans to allocate approximately 65% of its 2015 capital spending to development activities, 15% to exploration activities, and 20% to gas-gathering and processing activities and other business activities. The Company currently expects its 2015 capital spending by area to be approximately 55% for the U.S. onshore region and Alaska, 10% for the Gulf of Mexico, 20% for Midstream and other, and 15% for International.
Anadarko believes that its cash on hand, available borrowing capacity, and expected level of operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund the Companys projected operational and capital programs for 2015 and continue to meet its other current obligations. The Companys cash on hand is available for use and could be supplemented, as needed, with available borrowing capacity under the New Credit Facilities and the commercial paper program. The Company may also enter into carried-interest arrangements with third parties to fund certain capital expenditures, execute asset divestitures, and sell a portion of the WGP common units that it owns in order to supplement cash flow.
The Company continuously monitors its liquidity needs, coordinates its capital expenditure program with its expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule, and evaluates available funding alternatives in light of current and expected conditions. To reduce commodity-price risk and increase the predictability of 2015 cash flows, Anadarko entered into strategic derivative positions, which cover a portion of its anticipated natural-gas sales volumes for 2015 . For details of derivative positions at December31,2014 , see Note11Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements Anadarko may enter into off-balance-sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance-sheet obligations. The Companys material off-balance-sheet arrangements and transactions include operating lease arrangements and undrawn letters of credit. In addition, the Company enters into other contractual agreements in the normal course of business for processing, treating, transportation, and storage of natural gas, oil, and NGLs, as well as for other oil and gas activities as discussed below in Obligations and Commitments . Other than the items discussed above, there are no other transactions, arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect Anadarkos liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources.
76 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Obligations and Commitments The following is a summary of the Companys obligations at December31,2014 : Obligations by Period (1) millions 2015 2016-2017 2018-2019 2020 and beyond Total Total debt Principallong-term borrowings (2) $  $ 3,750 $ 1,874 $ 11,063 $ 16,687 Principalcapital lease obligation   1 20 21 Investee entities debt (3)    2,853 2,853 Interest on borrowings 876 1,647 1,219 7,907 11,649 Interest on capital lease obligations 2 3 3 15 23 Investee entities interest (3) 41 152 199 2,574 2,966 Operating leases Drilling rig commitments 939 1,310 460 28 2,737 Production platforms 33 43 43 51 170 Other 50 72 24 8 154 Asset retirement obligations 258 413 180 1,202 2,053 Midstream and marketing activities 930 1,904 1,775 2,656 7,265 Oil and gas activities 1,295 1,059 426 400 3,180 Derivative liabilities (4) 43 1,200   1,243 Uncertain tax positions, interest, and penalties (5) 123 193 5 11 332 Environmental liabilities 20 19 9 78 126 Other 40 222   262 Total $ 4,650 $ 11,987 $ 6,218 $ 28,866 $ 51,721 _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) This table does not include the Tronox-related contingent liability, other litigation-related contingent liabilities, or the Companys pension and postretirement benefit obligations. See Note17Contingencies Tronox Litigation and Note21Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits, and Defined-Contribution Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
(2) Includes the fully accreted principal amount of the Zero Coupons of approximately $2.4 billion as coming due after 2019 . While the Zero Coupons do not mature until 2036, the outstanding Zero Coupons can be put to the Company each October, in whole or in part, for the then-accreted value . The Company could be required to repurchase the outstanding Zero Coupons at $796million in October 2015 (the next potential put date).
(3) Anadarko has legal right of setoff and intends to net-settle its obligations under each of the notes payable to the investees with the distributable value of its interest in the corresponding investee. Accordingly, the investments and the obligations are presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other long-term liabilitiesother for all periods presented. These notes payable provide for a variable rate of interest, reset quarterly. Therefore, future interest payments presented in the table above are estimated using the forward LIBOR rate curve. Further, the above table does not reflect the preferred return that Anadarko receives on its investment in these entities, which is also LIBOR-based, but with a lower margin than the margin on the associated notes payable. See Note10Equity-Method Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
(4) Represents Anadarkos gross derivative liability after taking into account the impacts of netting margin and collateral balances deposited with counterparties. See Note11Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
(5) See Note18Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
77 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Operating Leases Operating lease obligations include approximately $2.5 billion related to seven offshore drilling vessels and $208 million related to certain contracts for U.S. onshore drilling rigs. Anadarko manages its access to rigs to support the execution of its drilling strategy over the next several years. Lease payments associated with the drilling of exploratory wells and development wells, net of amounts billed to partners, will initially be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties, and either depreciated or impaired in future periods or written off as exploration expense. At December31,2014 , the Company had $324 million in various commitments under non-cancelable operating lease agreements for production platforms and equipment, buildings, facilities, compressors, and aircraft. For additional information, see Note16Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
Asset Retirement Obligations Anadarko is obligated to fund the costs of disposing of long-lived assets upon their abandonment. The majority of Anadarkos asset retirement obligations (AROs) relate to the plugging of wells and the related abandonment of oil and gas properties. The Companys AROs are recorded at estimated fair value, measured by reference to the expected future cash outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligation discounted at the Companys credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Revisions to estimated AROs can result from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation rates, and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment.
Midstream and Marketing Activities Anadarko has entered into various processing, transportation, storage, and purchase agreements to access markets and provide flexibility to sell its natural gas, oil, and NGLs in certain areas.
Oil and Gas Activities At December31,2014 , Anadarko had various long-term contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development, and production activities that extend beyond 2014 . The Company has work-related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic data, and fulfilling rig commitments. The preceding table includes long-term drilling and work-related commitments of $3.2 billion , comprised of approximately $2.0 billion related to the United States and $1.2 billion related to international locations.
Environmental Liabilities Anadarko is subject to various environmental-remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state, and local laws and regulations. At December31,2014 , the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet included a $126 million liability for remediation and reclamation obligations. The Company continually monitors the liability recorded and ongoing remediation and reclamation activities, and believes the amount recordedis appropriate. For additional information on environmental issues, see Risk Factors under Item1A of this Form 10-K.
78 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP in the United States requires management to make informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. See Note1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K for discussion of the Companys significant accounting policies. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates, and actual results may differ from these estimates. Management considers the following to be its most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment. The selection, development, and disclosure of these estimates is discussed with the Companys Audit Committee.
Proved Reserves Anadarko estimates its proved oil and gas reserves according to the definition of proved reserves provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). This definition includes oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, government regulations, etc. (at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made). Prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements, and do not include adjustments based on expected future conditions.
The Companys estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data, as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions, and governmental restrictions, as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date.
The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of DD&A. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on DD&A and could result in property impairments. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by five percent across all calculations, DD&A in 2014 would have increased by approximately $210 million.
Exploratory Costs Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploratory costs associated with a well discovering hydrocarbons are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities, in particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, analyzing whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed. Therefore, at any point in time, the Company may have capitalized costs on its Consolidated Balance Sheets associated with exploratory wells that may be charged to exploration expense in future periods. See Note6Suspended Exploratory Well Costs in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
79 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Fair Value The Company estimates fair value for long-lived assets for impairment testing, reporting units for goodwill impairment testing when necessary, assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination or exchanged in non-monetary transactions, pension plan assets, and initial measurements of AROs. When the Company is required to measure fair value and there is not a market-observable price for the asset or liability or for a similar asset or liability, the Company uses the cost, income, or market valuation approaches depending on the quality of information available to support managements assumptions. The cost approach is based on managements best estimate of the current asset replacement cost. The income approach is based on managements best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate. The market approach is based on managements best assumptions regarding prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving comparable assets. Such evaluations involve significant judgment and the results are based on expected future events or conditions, such as sales prices, estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput, development and operating costs and the timing thereof, future net cash flows, economic and regulatory climates, and other factors, most of which are often outside of managements control. However, assumptions used reflect a market participants view of long-term prices, costs, and other factors, and are consistent with assumptions used in the Companys business plans and investment decisions.
Property Impairments When circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, the expected undiscounted future net cash flows of the asset group are compared to the carrying amount of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future net cash flows, based on our estimate of future oil and natural-gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to fair value. Fair value estimates require significant judgment and oil and natural-gas prices are a significant component of the fair-value estimate. Prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and the Company expects that volatility to continue in the future.
A long-lived asset other than unproved oil and gas property is evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may be greater than its undiscounted future net cash flows. Impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of an assets carrying amount over its estimated fair value. The Company uses a variety of fair-value measurement techniques as discussed below when market information for the same or similar assets does not exist.
Goodwill Impairments The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually at October1, or more frequently as circumstances dictate. The first step in assessing whether an impairment of goodwill is necessary is an optional qualitative assessment to determine the likelihood of whether the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that fair value of the reporting unit more than likely exceeds the related carrying amount, then goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not necessary. If the qualitative assessment is not performed or indicates fair value of the reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the Company compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets, including goodwill, and determines whether impairment is necessary.
Because quoted market prices for the Companys reporting units are not available, management applies judgment in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units for purposes of performing goodwill impairment tests, when such tests are necessary. Management uses all available information to make these fair-value estimates, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks associated with the assets and observable for the oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit, control premiums and market multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the gathering and processing and transportation reporting units.
80 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In estimating the fair value of its oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit, the Company assumes production profiles used in its estimation of reserves that are disclosed in the Companys supplemental oil and gas disclosures, market prices based on the forward price curve for oil and gas at the test date (adjusted for location and quality differentials), capital and operating costs consistent with pricing and expected inflation rates, and discount rates that management believes a market participant would use based upon the risks inherent in Anadarkos operations.
Management also includes control premium assumptions based on observable market information regarding how a market participant would value the oil and gas exploration and reporting unit as a whole rather than as individual properties that are part of an oil and gas portfolio.
For the Companys other gathering and processing, WES gathering and processing, and WES transportation reporting units, the Company estimates fair value by applying an estimated multiple to projected EBITDA. The Company considered observable transactions in the market and trading multiples for peers in determining an appropriate multiple to apply against the Companys projected EBITDA for these reporting units.
A lower fair-value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in impairment of goodwill. Factors that could trigger a lower fair-value estimate include commodity-price declines, cost increases, regulatory or political environment changes, and other changes in market conditions such as decreased prices in market-based transactions for similar assets, as well as difficulty or potential delays in obtaining drilling permits or other unanticipated events.
Environmental Obligations and Other Contingencies Management makes judgments and estimates when it establishes liabilities for environmental remediation, litigation, and other contingent matters. Estimates of litigation-related liabilities are based on the facts and circumstances of the individual case and on information currently available to the Company. The extent of information available varies based on the status of the litigation and the Companys evaluation of the claim and legal arguments. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Companys estimate of litigation-related liabilities including discovery activities, briefings filed with the relevant court, rulings from the court in the process or at the conclusion of any trial, and similar cases involving other plaintiffs and defendants that may set or change legal precedent. As events unfold throughout the litigation process, the Company evaluates the available information and may consult with third-party legal counsel to determine whether liability accruals should be established or adjusted.
Estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, the stage of investigation, the stage of the remedial design, evaluation of existing remediation technologies, and presently enacted laws and regulations. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Companys estimate of environmental-remediation costs, such as changes in laws and regulations, changes in the interpretation or administration of laws and regulations, revisions to the remedial design, unanticipated construction problems, identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater, and changes in costs of labor, equipment, and technology. Consequently, it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures that could arise related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the Companys estimates. The Companys in-house legal counsel and environmental personnel regularly assess contingent liabilities and, in certain circumstances, consult with third-party legal counsel or consultants to assist in the evaluation of the Companys liability for these contingencies.
81 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Income Taxes The amount of income taxes recorded by the Company requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of various tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses, and tax-credit carryforwards. The Company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets by analyzing the reversal periods of available net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards, temporary differences in tax assets and liabilities, the availability of tax planning strategies, and estimates of future taxable income and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Companys internal business forecasts. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. The Company routinely assesses potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, establishes accruals for such amounts. The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities, including deferred state income tax assets and liabilities, are subject to significant judgment by management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances. Although management considers its tax accruals adequate, material changes in these accruals may occur in the future, based on the progress of ongoing tax audits, changes in legislation, and resolution of pending tax matters.
RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS See Note1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K for discussion of recent accounting developments affecting the Company.
Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys primary market risks are attributable to fluctuations in energy prices and interest rates. In addition, foreign-currency exchange-rate risk exists due to anticipated foreign-currency-denominated payments and receipts. These risks can affect revenues and cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities. The Companys risk-management policies provide for the use of derivative instruments to manage these risks. The types of commodity derivative instruments used by the Company include futures, swaps, options, and fixed-price physical-delivery contracts. The volume of commodity derivatives entered into by the Company is governed by risk-management policies and may vary from year to year. Both exchange and over-the-counter traded commodity derivative instruments may be subject to margin-deposit requirements, and the Company may be required from time to time to deposit cash or provide letters of credit with exchange brokers or counterparties to satisfy these margin requirements. For additional information relating to the Companys derivative and financial instruments, see Note11Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form10-K.
COMMODITY-PRICE RISK The Companys most significant market risk relates to prices for natural gas, oil, and NGLs. Management expects energy prices to remain volatile and unpredictable. As energy prices decline or rise significantly, revenues and cash flows are likewise affected. In addition, a non-cash write-down of the Companys oil and gas properties or goodwill may be required if commodity prices experience a significant decline. Below is a sensitivity analysis for the Companys commodity-price-related derivative instruments.
Derivative Instruments Held for Non-Trading Purposes The Company had derivative instruments in place to reduce the price risk associated with future production of 356 Bcf of natural gas at December31,2014 , with a net derivative asset position of $228 million . Based on actual derivative contractual volumes, a 10% increase in natural-gas prices would reduce the fair value of these derivatives by $60million , while a 10% decrease in natural-gas prices would increase the fair value of these derivatives by $52million . However, any cash received or paid to settle these derivatives would be substantially offset by the realized sales value of equivalent production. In 2014, the Company terminated or offset then-existing 2015 oil three-way collars with a notional volume of 25 MBbls/d due to lower oil prices, resulting in a cash receipt of $126million.
82 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Derivative Instruments Held for Trading Purposes At December31,2014 , the Company had a net derivative asset position of $28 million (gains of $28 million ) on outstanding derivative instruments entered into for trading purposes. Based on actual derivative contractual volumes, a 10% increase or decrease in underlying commodity prices would not materially impact the Companys gains or losses on these derivative instruments.
For additional information regarding the Companys marketing and trading portfolio, see Marketing Activities under Items 1 and 2 of this Form 10-K.
INTEREST-RATE RISK Any borrowings under the New Credit Facilities, the WES RCF, and the commercial paper program are subject to variable interest rates. The balance of Anadarkos long-term debt on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets is subject to fixed interest rates. The Companys $2.9billion of LIBOR-based obligations, which are presented on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets net of preferred investments in two non-controlled entities, give rise to minimal net interest-rate risk because coupons on the related preferred investments are also LIBOR-based. A 10% increase in LIBOR would not impact the Companys interest cost on fixed-rate debt already outstanding, but would affect the fair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt.
At December31,2014 , the Company had a net derivative liability position of $1.2 billion related to interest-rate swaps. A 10% increase (decrease) in the three-month LIBOR interest-rate curve would increase (decrease) the aggregate fair value of outstanding interest-rate swap agreements by approximately $104 million . However, any change in the interest-rate derivative gain or loss could be substantially offset by actual borrowing costs associated with any future debt issuances or borrowings under the New Credit Facilities and the commercial paper program. For a summary of the Companys outstanding interest-rate derivative positions, see Note11Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
FOREIGN-CURRENCY EXCHANGE-RATE RISK Anadarkos operating revenues are realized in U.S. dollars, and the predominant portion of Anadarkos capital and operating expenditures are U.S.-dollar-denominated. Exposure to foreign-currency risk generally arises in connection with project-specific contractual arrangements and other commitments. Near-term foreign-currency-denominated expenditures are primarily in euros, Brazilian reais, British pounds sterling, Mozambican meticais, and Colombian pesos. Management periodically enters into various risk-management transactions to mitigate a portion of its exposure to foreign-currency exchange-rate risk.
The Company has risk related to exchange-rate changes applicable to cash held in escrow pending final determination of the Companys Brazilian tax liability for its 2008 divestiture of the Peregrino field offshore Brazil,which is currently under consideration by the Brazilian courts. See Note17Contingencies Other Litigation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K. At December31,2014 , cash of $128million was held in escrow. A 10% increase or decrease in the foreign-currency exchange rate would not materially impact the Companys gain or loss related to foreign currency.

The Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly the Companys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing its Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company includes amounts that are based on estimates and judgments that Management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The Companys financial statements have been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm appointed by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Management has made available to KPMG LLP all of the Companys financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of the stockholders and Directors meetings.
MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Anadarkos internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys Management and Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2014 . This assessment was based on criteria established in the Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Gwin Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer February20, 2015 85 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Anadarko Petroleum Corporation: We have audited Anadarko Petroleum Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) .
Anadarko Petroleum Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regardingthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) .
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation acquired Nuevo Midstream, LLC in November2014 and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of Anadarko Petroleum Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2014, Nuevo Midstream, LLCs internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $1.6billion and total revenues of $12.5million included in the consolidated financial statements of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Nuevo Midstream, LLC.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31,2014 and 2013 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31,2014 , and our report dated February20, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements .

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31,2014 and 2013 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended December31,2014 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

92 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, 2013, AND 2012 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies General Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is engaged in the exploration, development, production, and marketing of natural gas, oil, condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs), and anticipated production of liquefied natural gas(LNG). In addition, the Company engages in the gathering,processing, treating, and transporting of natural gas, oil, and NGLs. The Company also participates in the hard-minerals business through royalty arrangements. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms Anadarko and Company refer to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Anadarko and entities in which it holds a controlling interest. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Undivided interests in oil and natural-gas exploration and production joint ventures are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in non-controlled entities, over which Anadarko has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method. In applying the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognized at cost, and subsequently adjusted for the Companys proportionate share of earnings, losses, and distributions. Other investments are carried at original cost. Investments accounted for using the equity method and cost method are reported as a component of other assets. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Management evaluates its estimates and related assumptions regularly, including those related to proved reserves; the value of properties and equipment; goodwill; intangible assets; asset retirement obligations; litigation liabilities; environmental liabilities; pension assets, liabilities, and costs; income taxes; and fair values. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates, and actual results may differ from these estimates.
Fair Value Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Inputs used in determining fair value are characterized according to a hierarchy that prioritizes those inputs based on the degree to which they are observable. The three input levels of the fair-value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 Inputs represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (for example, exchange-traded commodity derivatives).
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (for example, quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets not considered to be active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, or market-corroborated inputs).
Level 3 Inputs that are not observable from objective sources, such as the Companys internally developed assumptions used in pricing an asset or liability (for example, an estimate of future cash flows used in the Companys internally developed present value of future cash flows model that underlies the fair-value measurement).
In determining fair value, the Company uses observable market data when available, or models that incorporate observable market data. In addition to market information, the Company incorporates transaction-specific details that, in managements judgment, market participants would take into account in measuring fair value.
93 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, 2013, AND 2012 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) In arriving at fair-value estimates, the Company uses relevant observable inputs available for the valuation technique employed. If a fair-value measurement reflects inputs at multiple levels within the hierarchy, the fair-value measurement is characterized based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair-value measurement. For Anadarko, recurring fair-value measurements are performed for interest-rate derivatives, commodity derivatives, and investments in trading securities.
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximates fair value. The fair value of debt is the estimated amount the Company would have to pay to repurchase its debt, including any premium or discount attributable to the difference between the stated interest rate and market interest rate at each balance sheet date. Debt fair values, as disclosed in Note12Debt and Interest Expense , are based on quoted market prices for identical instruments, if available, or based on valuations of similar debt instruments.
Non-financial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value include certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination or through a non-monetary exchange transaction, intangible assets, goodwill, asset retirement obligations, exit or disposal costs, and capital lease assets where the present value of lease payments is greater than the fair value of the leased asset.
Revenues The Companys natural gas is sold primarily to interstate and intrastate natural-gas pipelines, direct end-users, industrial users, local distribution companies, and natural-gas marketers. Oil and condensate are sold primarily to marketers, gatherers, and refiners. NGLs are sold primarily to direct end-users, refiners, and marketers.
The Company recognizes sales revenues for natural gas, oil and condensate, and NGLs based on the amount of each product sold to purchasers when delivery to the purchaser has occurred and title has transferred. This occurs when product has been delivered to a pipeline or when a tanker lifting has occurred. The Company follows the sales method of accounting for natural-gas production imbalances. If the Companys sales volumes for a well exceed the Companys proportionate share of production from the well, a liability is recognized to the extent that the Companys share of estimated remaining recoverable reserves from the well is insufficient to satisfy this imbalance. No receivables are recorded for those wells on which the Company has taken less than its proportionate share of production.
Anadarko provides gathering, processing, treating, and transporting services pursuant to a variety of contracts. Under these arrangements, the Company receives fees, or retains a percentage of products or a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of products and recognizes revenue at the time the services are performed or product is sold. These revenues are included in gathering, processing, and marketing sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Marketing margins related to the Companys production are included in natural-gas sales, oil and condensate sales, and NGLs sales. Marketing margins related to sales of commodities purchased from third parties and gains and losses on derivatives related to such marketing activities are included in gathering, processing, and marketing sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
The Company enters into buy/sell arrangements related to the transportation of a portion of its oil production. Under these arrangements, barrels are sold to a third party at a location-based contract price and subsequently repurchased by the Company at a downstream location. The difference in value between the sale and purchase price represents the transportation fee from the lease or certain gathering locations to more liquid markets. These arrangements are often required by private transporters. These transactions are reported on a net basis and included in oil and gas transportation in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
94 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, 2013, AND 2012 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts The Company conducts credit analyses of customers prior to making any sales to new customers or increasing credit for existing customers. Based on these analyses, the Company may require a standby letter of credit or a financial guarantee. The Company charges uncollectible accounts receivable against the allowance for uncollectible accounts when it determines collection will no longer be pursued.
Inventories Commodity inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market.
Properties and Equipment Properties and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense (DD&A). Costs of improvements that appreciably improve the efficiency or productive capacity of existing properties or extend their lives are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of properties and equipment, net of the related accumulated DD&A, is removed and, if appropriate, gain or loss is recognized in gains (losses) on divestitures and other, net.
Oil and Gas Properties The Company applies the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties. Exploration costs such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals, and exploration overhead are charged against earnings as incurred. If an exploratory well provides evidence to justify potential completion as a producing well, drilling costs associated with the well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling. This determination may take longer than one year in certain areas (generally in deepwater and international locations) depending on, among other things, the amount of hydrocarbons discovered, the outcome of planned geological and engineering studies, the need for additional appraisal drilling activities to determine whether the discovery is sufficient to support an economic development plan, and government sanctioning of development activities in certain international locations. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory well costs in light of ongoing exploration activitiesin particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed.
Acquisition costs of unproved properties are periodically assessed for impairment and are transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent the costs are associated with successful exploration activities. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment, based on the Companys current exploration plans, and a valuation allowance is provided if impairment is indicated. Unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs are amortized on a group basis (thereby establishing a valuation allowance) over the average lease terms at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration or abandonment. Costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged against the valuation allowance, while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Costs of maintaining and retaining unproved properties, as well as amortization of individually insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases, are included in exploration expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
95 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, 2013, AND 2012 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Capitalized Interest For significant projects, interest is capitalized as part of the historical cost of developing and constructing assets. Significant oil and gas investments in unproved properties, significant exploration and development projects that have not commenced production, significant midstream development activities that are in progress, and investments in equity method affiliates that are undergoing the construction of assets that have not commenced principle operations qualify for interest capitalization. Interest is capitalized until the asset is ready for service. Capitalized interest is determined by multiplying the Companys weighted-average borrowing cost on debt by the average amount of qualifying costs incurred. Once an asset subject to interest capitalization is completed and placed in service, the associated capitalized interest is expensed through depreciation or impairment. See Note12Debt and Interest Expense .
Asset Retirement Obligations Asset retirement obligations (AROs) associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets are recognized as liabilities with an increase to the carrying amounts of the related long-lived assets in the period incurred. The cost of the tangible asset, including the asset retirement cost, is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. AROs are recorded at estimated fair value, measured by reference to the expected future cash outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligations discounted at the Companys credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liabilities are accreted to their expected settlement value. If estimated future costs of AROs change, an adjustment is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the long-lived asset. Revisions to estimated AROs can result from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation rates, and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment. See Note7Asset Retirement Obligations .
Impairments Properties and equipment are reviewed for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that net book values may not be recoverable. In performing this review, an undiscounted cash flow test is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of cash flows from other assets. If the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the net book value of the property, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess, if any, of the propertys net book value over its estimated fair value. See Note5Impairments .
Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization Costs of drilling and equipping successful wells, costs to construct or acquire facilities other than offshore platforms, associated asset retirement costs, and capital lease assets used in oiland gas activities are depreciated using the unit-of-production (UOP) method based on total estimated proved developedoil and gas reserves. Costs of acquiring proved properties, including leasehold acquisition costs transferred from unproved properties and costs to construct or acquire offshore platforms and associated asset retirement costs, are depleted using the UOP method based on total estimated proved developed and undeveloped reserves. Mineral properties are also depleted using the UOP method. All other properties are stated at historical acquisition cost, net of impairments, and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 15 years for furniture and equipment, up to 40 years for buildings, and up to 47 years for gathering facilities.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing at October1 (or more frequent testing as circumstances dictate). Anadarko has allocated goodwill to the following reporting units: oil and gas exploration and production, other gathering and processing, Western Gas Partners, LP (WES) gathering and processing, and WES transportation. Changes in goodwill may result from, among other things, impairments, future acquisitions, or future divestitures. See Note8Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets .
Other intangible assets represent contractual rights obtained in connection with business combinations that had favorable contractual terms relative to market at the acquisition date as well as customer-related intangible assets, including customer relationships established by acquired contracts. Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are assessed for impairment whenever impairment indicators are present. See Note8Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets .

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Derivative Instruments Anadarko uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to cash-flow variability from commodity-price and interest-rate risk. Derivatives are carried on the balance sheet at fair value and are included in other current assets, other assets, accrued expenses, or other long-term liabilities, depending on the derivative position and the expected timing of settlement, unless they satisfy the normal purchases and sales exception criteria. Where the Company has the contractual right and intends to net settle, derivative assets and liabilities are reported on a net basis.
Gains and losses on derivative instruments are recognized currently in earnings. Net losses attributable to derivatives previously subjecttohedge accounting reside in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be reclassified toearnings in future periods as the economic transactions to which the derivatives relate affect earnings. See Note11Derivative Instruments .
AccountsPayable Accounts payable included liabilities of $388 million at December31,2014 , and $326million at December31,2013 , representing the amount by which checks issued, but not presented to the Companys banks for collection, exceeded balances in applicable bank accounts. Changes in these liabilities are reflected in cash flows from financing activities.
Legal Contingencies The Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business. Except for legal contingencies acquired in a business combination, which are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition, the Company accrues losses associated with legal claims when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. If the Company determines that a loss is probable and cannot estimate a specific amount for that loss, but can estimate a range of loss, the best estimate within the range is accrued. If no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. Estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes available or circumstances change. Legal defense costs associated with loss contingencies are expensed in the period incurred. See Note17Contingencies .
Environmental Contingencies The Company is subject to various environmental-remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Except for environmental contingencies acquired in a business combination, which are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition, the Company accrues losses associated with environmental obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. Accruals for estimated environmental losses are recognized no later than at the time the remediation feasibility study, or the evaluation of response options, is complete. These accruals are adjusted as additional information becomes available or circumstances change. Future environmental expenditures are not discounted to their present value. Recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recorded separately as assets at their undiscounted value when receipt of such recoveries is probable. See Note17Contingencies .
Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits, and Defined-Contribution Plans The Company measures pension plan assets at fair value. Defined-benefit plan obligations and costs are actuarially determined, incorporating the use of various assumptions. Critical assumptions for pension and other postretirement plans include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (for funded pension plans), the rate of future compensation increases, and the health care cost trend rate (for postretirement plans). Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover. The Company evaluates and updates its actuarial assumptions at least annually.
The Company amortizes prior service costs (credits) on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under each plan. Actuarial gains and losses that exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market-related value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits under each plan. See Note21Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits, and Defined-Contribution Plans .

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests represent third-party ownership in the net assets of theCompanys consolidated subsidiaries and are presented as a component of equity. Changes in Anadarkosownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in deconsolidation are recognized in equity. See Note9Noncontrolling Interests .
Income Taxes The Company files various U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax returns. Deferred federal, state, and foreign income taxes are provided on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. The Company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recorded is equal to the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be realized through final settlement with a taxing authority. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax expense (benefit). The Company uses the flow-through method to account for its investment tax credits. See Note18Income Taxes .
Share-Based Compensation The Company accounts for share-based compensation at fair value. The Company grants equity-classified awards including stock options and non-vested equity shares (restricted stock awards and units). The Company may also grant equity-classified and liability-classified awards based on a comparison of the Companys total shareholder return (TSR) to the TSR of a predetermined group of peer companies (performanceunits).
The fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Restricted stock awards and units are valued using the market price of Anadarko common stock. For other share-based compensation awards, fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation or discounted-cash-flow methodology.
The Company records compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, for share-based compensation awards over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. An adjustment is made to compensation cost for any difference between the estimated forfeitures and the actual forfeitures related to the awards. For equity-classified share-based compensation awards, expense is recognized based on the grant-date fair value. For liability-classified share-based compensation awards, expense is recognized for those awards expected to ultimately be paid. The amount of expense reported for liability-classified awards is adjusted for fair-value changes so that the expense recognized for each award is equivalent to the amount to be paid. See Note15Share-Based Compensation .
Earnings Per Share The Companys basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed based on the average numberofshares of common stock outstanding for the period and includes the effect of any participating securities as appropriate.Diluted EPS includes the effect of the Companys outstanding stock options, restricted stock awards,restricted stock units, and performance-based stock awards, if the inclusion of these items is dilutive. See Note13StockholdersEquity .
Recently Issued Accounting Standards The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update(ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . This ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition , and industry-specific guidance in Subtopic 932-605, Extractive ActivitiesOil and GasRevenue Recognition , and requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning in 2017 and is required to be adopted using one of two retrospective application methods, with no early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) ASU 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and requires additional disclosures, both for discontinued operations and for individually significant dispositions and assets classified as held for sale not qualifying as discontinued operations. This ASU is effective beginning in 2015, with early adoption permitted for disposals or for assets classified as held for sale not reported in previously issued financial statements. Anadarko early adopted this ASU on a prospective basis in the first quarter of 2014 with no material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
ASU 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists, requires that an unrecognized tax benefit or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset, except in certain circumstances. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning in 2014. See Note18Income Taxes .
2.  Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Assets Held for Sale Acquisitions In November 2014, WES acquired Nuevo Midstream, LLC (Nuevo), which owns and operates gathering and processing assets in the Delaware basin in West Texas, for $1.554billion . Following the acquisition, WES changed the name of Nuevo to Delaware Basin Midstream, LLC (DBM). This acquisition constitutes a business combination and was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. This acquisition aligns the Companys gas gathering and processing capacity with future industry production growth plans in the Delaware basin. The following summarizes the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, pending the acquired entitys final financial statements: millions Current assets $ 46 Properties and equipment 441 Other intangible assets 836 Accounts payable (13 ) Accrued expenses (25 ) Deferred income taxes (1 ) Asset retirement obligations (9 ) Goodwill 279 Total assets acquired and liabilities assumed $ 1,554 Fair-value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 inputs. The fair value of properties and equipment is based on market and cost approaches. Intangible assets consist of customer contracts, the fair value of which was determined using an income approach. Deferred tax assets (liabilities) represent the tax effects of differences in the tax basis and acquisition-date fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. All of the goodwill related to this acquisition is amortizable for tax purposes. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included within the midstream reporting segment.
Results of operations attributable to this acquisition are included in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income from the date acquired. The amounts of revenue and earnings included in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December31,2014, and the amounts of revenue and earnings that would have been recognized had the acquisition occurred on January1,2014, are not material to the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income.

Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Assets Held for Sale (Continued) There were no other material acquisitions made during 2014. The following summarizes acquisitions made during2013: millions, except percentages Percentage Acquired Cash Paid Certain oil and gas properties and related assets in the Moxa area of Wyoming 100 % $ 310 (1) Gas-gathering systems in the Marcellus shale in north-central Pennsylvania 33.75 % 135 Joint venture formed to design, construct, and own two fractionators located in Mont Belvieu, Texas 25 % 78 Intrastate pipeline in southwestern Wyoming 100 % 28 __________________________________________________________________ (1) Includes $306million that represents the fair value of the oil and gas properties acquired.
Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale The following summarizes the proceeds received and gains (losses) recognized on divestitures for the years ended December 31: millions 2014 2013 2012 Proceeds received $ 4,968 $ 567 $ 657 Gains (losses) on divestitures, net 1,891 (470 ) (71 ) Divestitures The 2014 proceeds and net gains were primarily related to assets included in the oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment. The Company sold a 10% working interest in Offshore Area 1 in Mozambique for $2.64billion , recognizing a gain of $1.5billion . In addition, the Company sold its Chinese subsidiary for $1.075billion , recognizing a gain of $510million ; sold its interest in the nonoperated Vito deepwater development, along with several surrounding exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, for $500million , recognizing a gain of $237million ; and sold its interest in the Pinedale/Jonah assets in Wyoming for $581million . These gains were partially offset by losses of $456million discussed under Assets Held for Sale below.
The 2013 sales proceeds were primarily related to the Companys divestiture of its interests in a soda ash joint venture and certain U.S. onshore and Indonesian oil and gas properties. Net losses were primarily related to the Companys sale of the Pinedale/Jonah assets discussed under Assets Held for Sale below, partially offset by the Companys divestiture of its interests in the soda ash joint venture and certain U.S. oil and gas properties. The 2012 sales proceeds were primarily related to U.S. oil and gas properties and net losses were primarily related to Indonesian oil and gas properties.
100 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, 2013, AND 2012 2.  Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Assets Held for Sale (Continued) Assets Held for Sale During the fourth quarter of 2014, Anadarko considered certain U.S. onshore assets from the oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment to be held for sale. These assets were remeasured to their fair value using a market approach and Level 2 fair-value measurement, and the Company recognized a loss of $456million . Gains and losses on assets held for sale are included in gains (losses) on divestitures and other, net in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. Volatility in the current commodity-price environment has reduced the probability that the assets will be sold within one year and the assets are therefore no longer considered held for sale at December31,2014. At December 31, 2014, the balances of assets and liabilities associated with assets held for sale were notmaterial.
During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company began marketing certain other domestic properties from the oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment to redirect its operating activities and capital investments to other areas. These assets were remeasured to their fair value using a market approach and Level 2 fair-value measurement. In 2013, the Company recognized losses of $704million primarily related to the sale of the Pinedale/Jonah assets in Wyoming, which closed in 2014. At December31,2013, the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets included long-term assets of $616million and long-term liabilities of $27million associated with assets held for sale.
Property Exchange In 2013, the Company exchanged certain oil and gas properties in the Wattenberg field with a third party. The properties exchanged were measured at the Companys historical net cost with no gain or loss recognized. Anadarko paid $106 million in cash as part of the exchange, which is included as an addition to properties and equipment on the Companys Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
3.  Inventories The following summarizes the major classes of inventories included in other current assets at December31: millions 2014 2013 Oil $ 133 $ 88 Natural gas 27 43 NGLs 83 79 Total inventories $ 243 $ 210 4.  Properties and Equipment The following summarizes the cost of properties and equipment by segment at December31: millions 2014 2013 Oil and gas exploration and production (1) $ 63,674 $ 61,302 Midstream 8,647 7,285 Marketing  9 Other 2,786 2,648 Total properties and equipment $ 75,107 $ 71,244 __________________________________________________________________ (1) Includes costs associated with unproved properties of $5.1billion at December31,2014 , and $6.9billion at December31,2013 .
101 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, 2013, AND 2012 5.  Impairments The following summarizes impairments by segment for the years ended December31: millions 2014 2013 2012 Oil and gas exploration and production Long-lived assets held for use U.S. onshore properties $ 545 $ 142 $ 259 Gulf of Mexico properties 276 562 104 Cost-method investment 3 11 13 Midstream Long-lived assets held for use 12 79 13 Total impairments $ 836 $ 794 $ 389 In 2014, certain U.S. onshore and Gulf of Mexico oil and gas properties were impaired primarily due to lower forecasted natural-gas and oil prices. While the Companys other U.S. onshore oil and gas properties indicated no impairment at December31,2014, it is reasonably possible the estimate of undiscounted cash flows related to certain of these properties may change in the near term due to declines in commodity prices and could result in additional property impairments.
In 2013, certain Gulf of Mexico properties were impaired due to a reduction in estimated future net cash flows and downward revisions of reserves resulting from changes to the Companys development plans. Also in 2013, certain U.S. onshore properties and related midstream assets were impaired due to downward revisions of reserves resulting from changes to the Companys development plans. In addition, a midstream property was impaired during 2013 due to a reduction in estimated future cash flows. In 2012, certain U.S. onshore and midstream properties were impaired primarily due to lower natural-gas prices and Gulf of Mexico properties were impaired primarily as a result of downward reserves revisions for a property that was near the end of its economic life. Impairments of the Companys Venezuelan cost-method investment were due to declines in estimated recoverable value.
The following summarizes the post-impairment fair value of the above-described assets, which was measured using the income approach and Level 3 inputs: millions 2014 2013 Long-lived assets held for use $ 731 $ 548 Cost-method investment (1) 32 32 __________________________________________________________________ (1) This represents the Companys after-tax net investment.
Impairments of Unproved Properties Impairments of unproved properties are included in exploration expense in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2012, the Company recognized a $721million impairment of unproved Powder River coalbed methane properties primarily due to lower natural-gas prices. Also in 2012, the Company recognized a $124 million impairment of an unproved Gulf of Mexico natural-gas property that the Company did not expect to develop under the forecasted natural-gas price environment.

Suspended exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year after completion of drilling were associated with 24 projects at December31,2014 , primarily located in Brazil, Ghana, and the Gulf of Mexico. Project costs suspended for longer than one year were primarily suspended pending the completion of economic evaluations including, but not limited to, results of additional appraisal drilling, well-test analysis, additional geological and geophysical data, facilities and infrastructure development options, development plan approval, and permitting. Projects with suspended exploratory well costs are those identified by management as exhibiting sufficient quantities of hydrocarbons to justify potential development and where management is actively pursuing efforts to assess whether reserves can be attributed to these projects. If additional information becomes available that raises substantial doubt as to the economic or operational viability of any of these projects, the associated costs will be expensed at that time.
103 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, 2013, AND 2012 7.  Asset Retirement Obligations The majority of Anadarkos AROs relate to the plugging of wells and the related abandonment of oil and gas properties. Revisionsin estimated liabilities during the period relate primarily to changes in estimates of asset retirement costs and include,but are not limited to, revisions of estimated inflation rates, changes in property lives,and the expected timing of settlement. The following summarizes changes in the Companys AROs during 2014 and 2013 : millions 2014 2013 Carrying amount of asset retirement obligations at January1 $ 2,022 $ 1,885 Liabilities incurred 119 182 Property dispositions (70 ) (76 ) Liabilities settled (443 ) (162 ) Accretion expense 93 110 Revisions in estimated liabilities 332 83 Carrying amount of asset retirement obligations at December31 $ 2,053 $ 2,022 8.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill The Companys 2014 annual impairment assessment of goodwill indicated no impairment. Procedures were also performed in the fourth quarter of 2014 to review any changes in circumstances subsequent to the annual test, including changes in commodity prices. These procedures also indicated no impairment. At December31,2014 , the Company had $5.6billion of goodwill allocated to the following reporting units: $5.1 billion to oil and gas exploration and production, $69 million to other gathering and processing, $379 million to WES gathering and processing, and $5million to WES transportation.
Significant declines in commodity prices, difficulties or potential delays in obtaining drilling permits, or other unanticipated events could result in further goodwill impairment tests in the near term, the results of which may have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations.
Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets and associated amortization expense were as follows: millions GrossCarrying Amount Accumulated Amortization NetCarrying Amount Amortization Expense December31,2014 Offshore platform leases $ 33 $ (29 ) $ 4 $  Customer contracts 1,004 (15 ) 989 6 $ 1,037 $ (44 ) $ 993 $ 6 December31,2013 Offshore platform leases $ 60 $ (50 ) $ 10 $ 3 Customer contracts 169 (9 ) 160 4 $ 229 $ (59 ) $ 170 $ 7 Customer contract intangible assets are primarily related to WESs DBM acquisition in 2014. These contracts are being amortized over 30 years . See Note2Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Assets Held for Sale . The annual aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets is expected to be $31million each of the next five years.
104 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, 2013, AND 2012 9.  Noncontrolling Interests In December2012, Western Gas Equity Partners, LP (WGP), a publicly traded consolidated subsidiary formed to own substantially all of the partnership interests in WES previously owned by Anadarko, completed its initial public offering (IPO) of approximately 20million common units representing limited partner interests in WGP at a price of $22.00 per common unit, for net proceeds of $411 million . During 2014, Anadarko sold approximately six million WGP common units to the public, raising net proceeds of $335 million . At December31,2014 , Anadarkos ownership interest in WGP consisted of an 88.3% limited partner interest and the entire non-economic general partner interest. The remaining 11.7% limited partner interest in WGP was owned by the public.
WES, a publicly traded consolidated subsidiary, is a limited partnership formed by Anadarko to own, operate, acquire, and develop midstream assets. WES issued approximately 10 million common units to the public raising net proceeds of $691million in 2014, approximately 12 million common units to the public raising net proceeds of $725million in 2013 , and approximately 5 million common units to the public raising net proceeds of $212 million in 2012 . In addition, WES issued 11million Class C units to Anadarko in 2014 to partially fund the DBM acquisition. These units will receive distributions in the form of additional Class C units until the end of 2017. At December31,2014 , WGPs ownership interest in WES consisted of a 34.9% limited partner interest, the entire 1.8% general partner interest, and all of the WES incentive distribution rights. At December31,2014 , Anadarko also owned an 8.3% limited partner interest in WES through other subsidiaries ownership of common and Class C units. The remaining 55% limited partner interest in WES was owned by the public.
10.  Equity-Method Investments In 2007, Anadarko contributed certain of its oil and gas properties and gathering and processing assets, with an aggregate fair value of $2.9 billion at the time of the contribution, to newly formed unconsolidated entities in exchange for noncontrolling mandatorily redeemable London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) based preferred interests in those entities. The common equity of the investee entities is 95% owned by third parties that also maintain control over the assets. Subsequent to their formation, the investee entities loaned Anadarko an aggregate of $2.9 billion . The Company accounts for its investment in these entities using the equity method of accounting. The carrying amount of these investments was $2.8 billion and the carrying amount of notes payable to affiliates was $2.9 billion at December31,2014 . Anadarko has legal right of setoff and intends to net settle its obligations under each of the notes payable to the investees with the distributable value of its interest in the corresponding investee. Accordingly, the investments and the obligations are presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other long-term liabilitiesother for all periods presented.
Interest on the notes issued by Anadarko is variable, based on LIBOR, plus a spread that fluctuates with Anadarkos credit rating. The applicable interest rate was 1.24% at December31,2014 and December31,2013 . The note payable agreement contains a covenant that provides for a maximum Anadarko debt-to-capital ratio of 67% . Anadarko was in compliance with this covenant at December31,2014 . Other (income) expense, net includes interest expense onthe notes payable of $36 million in 2014 , $37 million in 2013 , and $42 million in 2012 , and equity earnings from Anadarkos investments in the investee entities of $(45) million in 2014 , $(42) million in 2013 , and $(43) million in 2012 .

Derivative Instruments Objective and Strategy The Company uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to cash-flow variability from commodity-price and interest-rate risks. Futures, swaps, and options are used to manage exposure to commodity-price risk inherent in the Companys oil and natural-gas production and natural-gas processing operations (Oil and Natural-Gas Production/Processing Derivative Activities). Futures contracts and commodity-price swap agreements are used to fix the price of expected future oil and natural-gas sales at major industry trading locations, such as Henry Hub, Louisiana for natural gas and Cushing, Oklahoma or Sullom Voe, Scotland for oil. Basis swaps are periodically used to fix or float the price differential between product prices at one market location versus another. Options are used to establish a floor price, a ceiling price, or a floor and a ceiling price (collar) for expected future oil and natural-gas sales. Derivative instruments are also used to manage commodity-price risk inherent in customer price requirements and to fix margins on the future sale of natural gas and NGLs from the Companys leased storagefacilities (Marketing and Trading Derivative Activities).
Interest-rate swaps are used to fix or float interest rates on existing or anticipated indebtedness. The purpose of these instruments is to manage the Companys existing or anticipated exposure to interest-rate changes. The fair value of the Companys current interest-rate swap portfolio increases (decreases) when interest rates increase(decrease).
The Company does not apply hedge accounting to any of its derivative instruments. As a result, gains and losses associated with derivative instruments are recognized currently in earnings. Net derivative losses attributable to derivatives previously subject to hedge accounting reside in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to earnings as the transactions to which the derivatives relate are recognized in earnings.See Note14Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) .
Oil and Natural-Gas Production/Processing Derivative Activities The natural-gas prices listed below are New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) Henry Hub prices.

MMBtumillion British thermal units MMBtu/dmillion British thermal units per day A three-way collar is a combination of three options: a sold call, a purchased put, and a sold put. The sold call establishes the maximum price that the Company will receive for the contracted commodity volumes. The purchased put establishes the minimum price that the Company will receive for the contracted volumes unless the market price for the commodity falls below the sold put strike price, at which point the minimum price equals the reference price (e.g., NYMEX) plus the excess of the purchased put strike price over the sold put strike price.
In 2014, the Company terminated or offset then-existing 2015 oil three-way collars with a notional volume of 25 thousand barrels per day due to lower oil prices, resulting in a cash receipt of $126 million .

Derivative Instruments (Continued) Marketing and Trading Derivative Activities The Company had financial derivative transactions with notional volumes of natural gas totaling 6 billion cubic feet(Bcf) at December31,2014 , and 16 Bcf at December31,2013 , that were entered into to mitigate commodity-price risk related to fixed-price purchase and sales contracts and storageactivity.
Interest-Rate Derivatives Anadarko has outstanding interest-rate swap contracts to manage interest-rate risk associated with anticipated debt issuances. The Company has locked in a fixed interest rate in exchange for a floating interest rate indexed to the three-month LIBOR. These swap instruments include a provision that requires both the termination of the swaps and cash settlement in full at the start of the reference period.
To align the interest-rate swap portfolio with anticipated future debt financing, in 2014 the Company extended the reference-period start dates from June 2014 to September 2016 and adjusted the related fixed interest rates for interest-rate swaps with an aggregate notional principal amount of $1.1 billion , and in 2012 the Company extended the reference-period start dates from October 2012 to September 2016 and adjusted the related fixed interest rates for interest-rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of $800 million . In addition, in anticipation of the July 2014 issuance of an aggregate $1.25 billion of Senior Notes, interest-rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of $750 million were settled in 2014, resulting in a cash payment of $222 million . Interest-rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of $200 million were also settled in October 2012, resulting in a cash payment of $64million .
Derivative settlements are classified as cash flows from operating activities unless the derivatives contain an other-than-insignificant financing element, in which case the settlements are classified as cash flows from financing activities. As a result of prior extensions of reference-period start dates without settlement of the related interest-rate derivative obligations, the interest-rate derivatives in the Companys portfolio contain an other-than-insignificant financing element and, therefore settlements related to these extended interest-rate derivatives are classified as cash flows from financing activities.

Derivative Instruments (Continued) Credit-Risk Considerations The financial integrity of exchange-traded contracts, which are subject to nominal credit risk, is assured by NYMEX or IntercontinentalExchange, Inc. through systems of financial safeguards and transaction guarantees. Over-the-counter traded swaps, options, and futures contracts expose the Company to counterparty credit risk. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties, establishes credit limits according to the Companys credit policies and guidelines, and assesses the impact on fair value of its counterparties creditworthiness. The Company has the ability to require cash collateral or letters of credit to mitigate its credit-risk exposure. The Company has netting agreements with financial institutions that permit net settlement of gross commodity derivative assets against gross commodity derivative liabilities, and routinely exercises its contractual right to offset gains and losses when settling with derivative counterparties.
In addition, the Company has setoff agreements with certain financial institutions that may be exercised in the event of default and provide for contract termination and net settlement across derivative types. At December31,2014 , $289 million of the Companys $1.455billion gross derivative liability balance, and at December31,2013 , $76million of the Companys $986million gross derivative liability balance would have been eligible for setoff against the Companys gross derivative asset balance in the event of default. Other than in the event of default, the Company does not net settle across derivative types.
The Companys derivative instruments are subject to individually negotiated credit provisions that may require collateral of cash or letters of credit depending on the derivatives valuation versus negotiated credit thresholds. These credit thresholds may also require full or partial collateralization or immediate settlement of the Companys obligations if certain credit-risk-related provisions are triggered, such as if the Companys credit rating from major credit rating agencies declined to below investment grade. However, most of the Companys derivative counterparties maintained secured positions at December31,2014, with respect to the Companys derivative liabilities under the Companys $5.0 billion senior secured revolving credit facility ($5.0billionFacility). In January 2015, the Companys $5.0billion Facility was replaced by new unsecured facilities under which the Companys derivative counterparties no longer maintain security interests in any of the Companys assets. As a result, the Company may be required from time to time to post collateralof cash or letters of credit based on the negotiated terms of the individual derivative agreements. For information on the Companys revolving credit facilities, see Note12Debt and Interest Expense Anadarko Revolving Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Program .
The aggregate fair value of unsecured derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features for which a net liability position existed was $97 million (net of collateral) at December31,2014 , and $42million at December31,2013 . The current portion of these amounts was included in accrued expenses and the long-term portion of these amounts was included in other long-term liabilities  other on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Derivative Instruments (Continued) Fair Value Valuations of physical-delivery purchase and sale agreements, over-the-counter financial swaps, and commodity option collars are based on similar transactions observable in active markets and industry-standard models that primarily rely on market-observable inputs. Inputs used to estimate fair value in industry-standard models are categorized as Level 2 inputs because substantially all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the full term of the instruments. Inputs used to estimate the fair value of swaps and options include market-price curves; contract terms and prices; credit-risk adjustments; and, for Black-Scholes option valuations, discount factors and implied market volatility.

Debt and Interest Expense (Continued) In a 2006 private offering, Anadarko received $500 million of loan proceeds upon issuing the Zero-Coupon Senior Notes due 2036 (Zero Coupons). The Zero Coupons mature in 2036 and have an aggregate principal amount due at maturity of approximately $2.4 billion , reflecting a yield to maturity of 5.24% . The Zero Coupons can be put to the Company in October of each year, in whole or in part, for the then-accreted value of the outstanding Zero Coupons. The accreted value of the outstanding Zero Coupons was $765million at December31,2014 . Anadarkos Zero Coupons are classified as long-term debt on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets, as the Company has the ability and intent to refinance these obligations using long-termdebt.
Fair Value The Company uses a market approach to determine the fair value of its fixed-rate debt using observable market data, which results in a Level 2 fair-value measurement. The carrying amount of floating-rate debt approximates fair value as the interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates. The estimated fair value of the Companys total borrowings was $17.4 billion at December31,2014 , and $15.3 billion at December31,2013 .

Debt and Interest Expense (Continued) Anadarko Revolving Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Program During 2014, the Company maintained the $5.0 billion Facility maturing in September 2015 . Obligations incurred under the $5.0 billion Facility, as well as obligations Anadarko had to lenders or their affiliates pursuant to certain derivative instruments that were supported by the $5.0 billion Facility as discussed in Note11Derivative Instruments , were guaranteed by certain of the Companys wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, and were secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in certain exploration and production assets located in the United States and 65% of the capital stock of certain wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. During 2014, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the $5.0billion Facility.
In June2014, Anadarko entered into a $3.0billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility ( Five -Year Facility), which is expandable to $4.0billion , and a $2.0billion 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility ( 364 -Day Facility). The new facilities (collectively, the New Credit Facilities) replaced the $5.0 billion Facility upon satisfaction of certain conditions, including the January2015 settlement payment related to the Tronox Adversary Proceeding. For additional information, see Note17Contingencies Tronox Litigation .
In January2015, the Company borrowed $1.5billion under the 364-Day Facility. Borrowings under the New Credit Facilities generally bear interest under one of two rate options, at Anadarkos election, using either LIBOR (or Euro Interbank Offered Rate in the case of borrowings under the Five-Year Facility denominated in Euro) or an alternate base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 1.65% for the Five-Year Facility and 0.00% to 1.675% for the 364-Day Facility. The applicable margin will vary depending on Anadarkos credit ratings.
The New Credit Facilities contain certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant requiring maintenance of a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 65%, and limitations on certain secured indebtedness, sale-and-leaseback transactions, and mergers and other fundamental changes.
In January 2015, the Company initiated a commercial paper program, which allows a maximum of $3.0billion of unsecured commercial paper notes. The maturities of the commercial paper notes vary, but may not exceed 397 days . The commercial paper notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are issued either at a discounted price to their principal face value or will bear interest at varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. Such discounted price or interest amounts are dependent on market conditions and the ratings assigned to the commercial paper program by credit rating agencies at the time of issuance of the commercial paper notes.
WES Borrowings In February 2014, WES amended and restated its then-existing $800million senior unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into a five-year, $1.2 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in February 2019 (RCF), which is expandable to a maximum of $1.5billion . Borrowings under the RCF bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.975% to 1.45% depending on WESs credit rating, or the greatest of (i) rates at a margin above the one-month LIBOR, (ii) the federal funds rate, or (iii) prime rates offered by certain designated banks. At December31,2014 , WES was in compliance with all covenants contained in itsRCF, had outstanding borrowings under its RCF of $510million at an interest rate of 1.47% , and had available borrowing capacity of approximately $677million ($1.2billion capacity, less $510 million of outstanding borrowings and $13million of outstanding letters of credit).

Share-Based Compensation (Continued) Equity-Classified Awards Restricted Stock Certain employees may be granted restricted stock in the form of restricted stock awards or restricted stock units. Restricted stock is subject to forfeiture restrictions and cannot be sold, transferred, or disposed of during the restriction period. The holders of restricted stock awards have the same rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to such shares, including the right to vote and receive dividends or other distributions paid with respect to the shares. A restricted stock unit is equivalent to a restricted stock award except that unit holders do not have the right to vote. Restricted stock vests over service periods ranging from the date of grant up to three years and is not considered issued and outstanding until vested.
Non-employee directors are granted deferred shares, which are also considered restricted stock, that are held in a grantor trust by the Company until payable. Non-employee directors may receive these shares in a lump-sum payment or in annual installments.
The following summarizes the Companys restricted stock activity: Shares (millions) Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value (per share) Non-vested at January 1, 2014 3.22 $ 82.53 Granted 2.05 $ 87.42 Vested (1.52 ) $ 82.35 Forfeited (0.15 ) $ 84.49 Non-vested at December 31, 2014 3.60 $ 85.31 The weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of restricted stock granted was $84.17 during 2013 and $79.97 during 2012 . The total fair value of restricted shares vested was $132 million during 2014 , $110 million during 2013 , and $105 million during 2012 , based on the market price at the vesting date. At December31,2014 , total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock of $199 million is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining service period of 1.9 years .

Share-Based Compensation (Continued) Stock Options Certain employees may be granted nonqualified options to purchase shares of Anadarko common stock with an exercise price equal to, or greater than, the fair market value of Anadarko common stock on the date of grant. These stock options generally vest over three years from the date of grant and terminate at the earlier of the date of exercise or seven years from the date of grant.
The fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:  Expected life Based on historical exercise behavior.
Volatility Based on an average of historical volatility over the expected life of an option and the 12-month average implied volatility.
Risk-free interest rates Based on the U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life of an option.
Dividend yield Based on a 12-month average dividend yield, taking into account the Companys expected dividend policy over the expected life of an option.
Expected forfeiture Based on historical forfeiture experience.
The Company used the following weighted-average assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock options granted: 2014 2013 2012 Weighted-average grant-date fair value $ 23.55 $ 26.27 $ 25.84 Assumptions Expected option lifeyears 4.9 4.8 4.9 Volatility 29.9 % 33.9 % 44.2 % Risk-free interest rate 1.6 % 1.3 % 0.7 % Dividend yield 1.1 % 0.8 % 0.5 % The following summarizes the Companys stock option activity: Shares (millions) Weighted- Average Exercise Price (pershare) Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (millions) Outstanding at January1, 2014 7.72 $ 63.30 Granted 0.95 $ 93.34 Exercised (1) (1.85 ) $ 54.03 Forfeited or expired (0.03 ) $ 76.00 Outstanding at December31, 2014 6.79 $ 69.96 3.56 $ 104.3 Vested or expected to vest at December31, 2014 6.73 $ 69.79 3.54 $ 104.2 Exercisable at December31, 2014 4.99 $ 62.91 2.60 $ 101.1 __________________________________________________________________ (1) The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $88 million during 2014 , $80 million during 2013 , and $49 million during 2012 , based on the difference between the market price at the exercise date and the exercise price.

Share-Based Compensation (Continued) Liability-Classified Awards Value Creation Plan As a part of its employee compensation program, the Company offers an incentive compensation program that provides non-officer employees the opportunity to earn cash bonus awards based on the Companys TSR for the year, compared to the TSR of a predetermined group of peer companies. The Company paid zero during 2014 and 2013 related to the plan and $24million during 2012 . At December31,2014 , the Company had $137million outstanding liability attributable to the 2014 performance period.
Performance-Based Unit Awards Certain officers of the Company were provided Performance Unit Award Agreements with two - and three -year performance periods. The vesting of these units is based on comparing the Companys TSR to the TSR of a predetermined group of peer companies over the specified performance period. Each performance unit represents the value of one share of the Companys common stock. At the end of each performance period, the value of the vested performance units, if any, is paid in cash. The Company paid $12 million related to vested performance units in 2014 , $15million in 2013 , and $37 million in 2012 . At December31,2014 , the Companys liability under Performance Unit Award Agreements was $26 million , with total unrecognized compensation cost related to these awards of $43 million expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining performance period of 2.2 years .
Other Performance-Based Awards Prior to 2011, certain officers of the general partner of WES were awarded general partner Unit Appreciation Rights (UARs) pursuant to the Western Gas Holdings, LLC Equity Incentive Plan. The fair value of the UARs was determined based on the fair value of WESs general partner, as determined by the WGP IPO price. The Company paid $203 million related to the UARs upon the WGP IPO in 2012 in settlement of obligations related to all awards then outstanding.

Commitments Operating Leases At December31,2014 , the Company had $2.7 billion in long-term drilling rig commitments that satisfy operating lease criteria. The Company also had $324 million of various commitments under non-cancelable operating lease agreements for production platforms and equipment, buildings, facilities, compressors, and aircraft. These operating leases expire at various dates through 2026 . Certain of these operating leases contain residual value guarantees at the end of the lease term, totaling $53 million at December31,2014 .
No liability has been accrued for residual value guarantees. In addition, these operating leases include options to purchase the leased property during or at the end of the lease term for the fair market value or other specified amount at that time. The following summarizes future minimum lease payments under operating leases at December31,2014 : millions 2015 $ 1,022 2016 833 2017 592 2018 324 2019 203 Later years 87 Total future minimum lease payments $ 3,061 Anadarko has entered into various agreements to secure drilling rigs necessary to support the execution of its drilling plans over the next several years. The table of future minimum lease payments above includes $2.5billion related to seven offshore drilling vessels and $208million related to certain contracts for U.S. onshore drilling rigs. Lease payments associated with the drilling of exploratory wells and development wells, net of amounts billed to partners, will initially be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties, and either depreciated or impaired in future periods or written off as exploration expense.
Total rent expense, net of sublease income and amounts capitalized, amounted to $85million in 2014 , $119million in 2013 , and $136million in 2012 . Total rent expense includes contingent rent expense related to transportation and processing fees of $22million in 2014 , $24million in 2013 , and $28million in 2012 .
Other Commitments In the normal course of business, the Company enters into other contractual agreements for processing, treating, transportation, and storage of natural gas, oil, and NGLs, as well as for other oil and gas activities. These agreements expire at various dates through 2036 . At December31,2014 , aggregate future payments under these contracts totaled $10.4billion , of which $2.2billion is expected to be paid in 2015 , $1.6billion in 2016 , $1.3billion in 2017 , $1.2billion in 2018 , $1.0billion in 2019 , and $3.1billion thereafter.
120 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, 2013, AND 2012 17.  Contingencies Litigation The Company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits, is involved in governmental proceedings, and is subject to regulatory controls arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, personal injury claims; property damage claims; title disputes; tax disputes; royalty claims; contract claims; contamination claims relating to oil and gas production, transportation, and processing; and environmental claims, including claims involving assets owned by acquired companies and claims involving assets previously sold to third parties and no longer a part of the Companys current operations. The Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets include liabilities of $5.3billion at December31,2014 , and $854million at December31,2013 , for litigation-related contingencies. Anadarko is also subject to various environmental-remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state, and local laws and regulations. While the ultimate outcome and impact on the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, after consideration of recorded expense and liability accruals, management believes that the resolution of pending proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Tronox Litigation On November 28, 2005, Tronox Incorporated (Tronox), at the time a subsidiary of Kerr-McGee Corporation, completed an IPO and was subsequently spun-off from Kerr-McGee Corporation. In August 2006, Anadarko acquired all of the stock of Kerr-McGee Corporation. In January 2009, Tronox and certain of Tronoxs subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Bankruptcy Court), which is the court that presided over the Adversary Proceeding (defined below). In May 2009, Tronox and certain of its affiliates filed a lawsuit against Anadarko and Kerr-McGee Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, Kerr-McGee) asserting several claims, including claims for actual and constructive fraudulent conveyance (Adversary Proceeding). Tronox alleged, among other things, that it was insolvent or undercapitalized at the date of its IPO and sought, among other things, to recover damages in excess of $18.85 billion from Kerr-McGee and Anadarko, as well as interest and attorneys fees and costs. In accordance with Tronoxs Bankruptcy Court-approved Plan of Reorganization (Plan), the Adversary Proceeding was pursued by a litigation trust (Litigation Trust). Pursuant to the Plan, the Litigation Trust was deemed substituted for the Tronox plaintiffs in the Adversary Proceeding. For purposes of this Form 10-K, references to Tronox after February2011 refer to the Litigation Trust.
The U.S. government intervened in the Adversary Proceeding, and in May 2009 asserted separate claims against Anadarko and Kerr-McGee under the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act (FDCPA Complaint). The Litigation Trust and the U.S. government agreed that the recovery of damages under the Adversary Proceeding, if any, would cover both the Adversary Proceeding and the FDCPA Complaint.
Liability Accrual On April 3, 2014, Anadarko and Kerr-McGee entered into a settlement agreement with the Litigation Trust and the U.S. government (in its capacity as plaintiff-intervenor and acting for and on behalf of certain U.S. government agencies) to resolve all claims asserted in the Adversary Proceeding and FDCPA Complaint for $5.15billion , which represents principal of approximately $3.98billion plus 6% interest from the filing of the Adversary Proceeding on May12,2009, through April 3, 2014. In addition, the Company agreed to pay interest on the above amount from April 3, 2014, through the payment of the settlement, with an annual interest rate of 1.5% for the first 180 days and 1.5% plus the one-month LIBOR thereafter. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the Litigation Trust, Anadarko, and Kerr-McGee agreed to mutually release all claims that were or could have been asserted in the Adversary Proceeding. The U.S. government (representing federal agencies that filed claims in the Tronox bankruptcy), Anadarko, and Kerr-McGee also provided covenants not to sue each other with respect to certain claims and causes of action. The U.S. government also provided contribution protection from third-party claims seeking reimbursement from Anadarko and certain of its affiliates for the sites identified in the settlement agreement. In January2015, the Company paid $5.2billion after the settlement agreement became effective.

Contingencies (Continued) Anadarko recognized Tronox-related contingent losses of $850million in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $4.3billion in the first quarter of 2014. In addition, Anadarko recognized settlement-related interest expense of $60million , included in Tronox-related contingent loss in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income, during the year ended December31,2014 , for an aggregate $5.2billion Tronox-related contingent liability on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December31,2014 . For information on the tax effects of the Tronox settlement agreement, see Note18Income Taxes .
Deepwater Horizon Events In April 2010, the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico blew out and an explosion occurred on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, resulting in an oil spill. The well was operated by BP Exploration and Production Inc. (BP) and Anadarko held a 25% nonoperated interest. In October 2011, the Company and BP entered into a settlement agreement, mutual releases, and agreement to indemnify relating to the Deepwater Horizon events (Settlement Agreement), under which the Company paid $4.0 billion in cash and transferred its interest in the Macondo well and the Mississippi Canyon Block 252 (Lease) to BP. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Company is fully indemnified by BP against all claims, causes of action, losses, costs, expenses, liabilities, damages, or judgments of any kind arising out of the Deepwater Horizon events, related damage claims arising under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), claims for natural resource damages (NRD) and assessment costs, and any claims arising under the Operating Agreement with BP (OA). This indemnification is guaranteed by BP Corporation North America Inc. (BPCNA) and, in the event that the net worth of BPCNA declines below an agreed-upon amount, BP p.l.c. has agreed to become the sole guarantor. Under the Settlement Agreement, BP does not indemnify the Company against penalties and fines, punitive damages, shareholder derivative or securities laws claims, or certain other claims.
Liability Accrual Below is a discussion of the Companys current analysis, under applicable accounting guidance, of its potential liability for (i)amounts invoiced by BP under the OA (OA Liabilities), (ii)OPA-related environmental costs, and (iii)other contingent liabilities. Applicable accounting guidance requires the Company to accrue a liability if both (a) it is probable that a liability has been incurred and (b) the amount of that liability can be reasonably estimated.
The Company is fully indemnified by BP against OPA damage claims, NRD claims and assessment costs, and other potential liabilities. The Company may be required to recognize a liability for these amounts in advance of or in connection with recognizing a receivable from BP for the related indemnity payment. In all circumstances, however, the Company expects that any additional indemnified liability that may be recognized by the Company will be subsequently recovered from BP itself or through the guarantees of BPCNA or BPp.l.c. The Company has not recorded a liability for any costs that are subject to indemnification by BP.
OA Liabilities Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, all amounts deemed by BP to have been due under the OA, as well as all future amounts that otherwise would be invoiced to Anadarko under the OA, have been satisfied.
OPA-Related Environmental Costs BP, Anadarko, and other parties, including parties that do not own an interest in the Lease, such as the drilling contractor, have received correspondence from the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) referencing their identification as a responsible party or guarantor (RP) under OPA. Under OPA, RPs, including Anadarko, may be jointly and severally liable for costs of well control, spill response, and containment and removal of hydrocarbons, as well as other costs and damage claims related to the spill and spill cleanup. The USCGs identification of Anadarko as an RP arises as a result of Anadarkos status as a co-lessee in the Lease.
Under accounting guidance applicable to environmental liabilities, a liability is presumed probable if the entity is both identified as an RP and associated with the environmental event. The Companys co-lessee status in the Lease at the time of the event and the subsequent identification and treatment of the Company as an RP satisfies these standards and therefore establishes the presumption that the Companys potential environmental liabilities related to the Deepwater Horizon events are probable.
122 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, 2013, AND 2012 17.  Contingencies (Continued) As BP funds OPA-related environmental costs, any potential joint and several liability for these costs is satisfied for all RPs, including Anadarko. This bears significance in that once these costs are funded by BP, such costs are no longer analyzed as OPA-related environmental costs, but instead are analyzed as OA Liabilities. As discussed above, Anadarko has settled its OA Liabilities with BP. Thus, potential liability to the Company for OPA-related environmental costs can arise only where BP does not, or otherwise is unable to, fund all of the OPA-related environmental costs. Under this scenario, the joint and several nature of the liability for these costs could cause the Company to recognize a liability for OPA-related environmental costs. However, the Company is fully indemnified by BP against these costs (including guarantees by BPCNA or BPp.l.c.).
Gross OPA-Related Environmental Cost Estimate In prior periods through the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company provided an estimated range of gross OPA-related environmental costs for all identified RPs. This estimate was comprised of spill-response costs and OPA damage claims and was derived from cost information received by the Company from BP. The Company no longer receives Deepwater Horizon-related cost and claims data from BP. Accordingly, the OPA-related environmental cost estimate included in BPs public releases is the best data available to the Company.
Based on information included in BP p.l.c.s public release on February3, 2015, gross OPA-related environmental costs are estimated to be $11.0 billion , excluding (i)amounts BP has already funded, which constitute settled OA Liabilities; (ii)amounts that in BPs view cannot reasonably be estimated, which include NRD claims and other litigation damages; (iii)non-OPA-related fines and penalties that may be assessed against Anadarko, including assessments under the Clean Water Act (CWA); and (iv)estimated state and local governmental claims, which BP no longer publicly discloses and, as a result, Anadarko cannot estimate. Actual gross OPA-related environmental costs may vary from those estimated by BP p.l.c. in its public releases, perhaps materially from the above estimate.
Allocable Share of Gross OPA-Related Environmental Costs Under applicable accounting guidance, the Company is required to estimate its allocable share of gross OPA-related environmental costs. To date, BP has paid all Deepwater Horizon event-related costs, which satisfies the Companys potential liability for these costs. Additionally, BP has repeatedly stated publicly and in congressional testimony that it will continue to pay these costs. BPs funding and public commentary has continued subsequent to the release of BPs own investigation report, the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drillings final report, and the Deepwater Horizon Joint Investigation Team final report, which the Company considers to be significant positive indications in assessing the likelihood of BP continuing to fund all of these costs. Based on BPs stated intent to continue funding these costs, the Companys assessment of BPs financial ability to continue funding these costs, and the impact of BPs settlements with both of its OA partners, the Company believes the likelihood of BP not continuing to satisfy these claims to be remote. Accordingly, the Company considers zero to be its allocable share of gross OPA-related environmental costs and, consistent with applicable accounting guidance, has not recorded a liability for these amounts.
123 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, 2013, AND 2012 17.  Contingencies (Continued) Penalties and Fines These costs include amounts that may be assessed as a result of potential civil and/or criminal penalties under various federal, state, and/or local statutes and/or regulations as a result of the Deepwater Horizon events, including, for example, the CWA, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and possibly other federal, state, and local laws. The foregoing does not represent an exhaustive list of statutes and regulations that potentially could trigger a penalty or fine assessment against the Company. To date, no penalties or fines have been assessed against the Company. However, in December2010, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), on behalf of the United States, filed a civil lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in New Orleans, Louisiana (Louisiana District Court) against several parties, including the Company, seeking an assessment of civil penalties under the CWA in an amount to be determined by the Louisiana District Court. In February 2012, the Louisiana District Court entered a declaratory judgment that, as a partial owner of the Macondo well, Anadarko is liable for civil penalties under Section311 of the CWA. The declaratory judgment, which was affirmed in June2014 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Fifth Circuit), addresses liability only, and does not address the amount of any civil penalty. The assessment of a civil penalty against Anadarko will follow a bench trial, which began in January2015.
In July 2014, Anadarko filed a motion for rehearing with the Fifth Circuit requesting that the full court sit to reconsider Anadarkos appeal concerning that portion of the February2012 declaratory judgment which found Anadarko liable for civil penalties under the CWA. In September2014, Anadarko filed a letter notifying the Fifth Circuit that the Louisiana District Court issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in the first phase of the Deepwater Horizon trial (Phase I Findings and Conclusions), which included facts that contradict certain key facts assumed by the Fifth Circuit panel in its June2014 decision. In January2015, the Fifth Circuit denied the petition for full court reconsideration with six of the thirteen participating justices filing a dissent.
Applicable accounting guidance requires the Company to accrue a liability if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Louisiana District Courts declaratory judgment in February2012 satisfies the requirement that a liability arising from the future assessment of a civil penalty against Anadarko is probable. In an effort to resolve this matter, the Company made a settlement offer to the DOJ in July 2014 of $90million and recorded a contingent liability for this amount at June 30, 2014. The Company subsequently engaged in further discussions regarding settlement, but the parties have not been able to reach agreement on either the amount of, or the terms and conditions governing, a settlement. The Companys settlement offer of $90million remains outstanding and the Company remains open to resolving the matter through settlement discussions. The Company believes that $90million under a settlement scenario is a better estimate of loss at this time than any other amount. Based on the above accounting guidance, the Companys contingent liability for CWA penalties and fines remains $90million at December31,2014 . However, the Company may ultimately incur a liability related to CWA penalties in excess of the current accrued liability.
The actual amount of a CWA penalty is subject to uncertainty, including whether the Company will be able to reach a settlement with the DOJ or will await the Louisiana District Courts opinion following the bench trial. The CWA sets forth subjective criteria to be considered by the court in assessing the magnitude of any CWA penalty, including the degree of fault of the owner. In the Phase I and II trials (defined below) and again for the penalty phase trial in January 2015, the Louisiana District Court ruled that no evidence of Anadarkos alleged culpability or fault may be presented. In addition, in its Phase I Findings and Conclusions, the Louisiana District Court did not allocate any fault to Anadarko. Given the subjective nature of the CWA criteria used to determine penalty assessments and the Louisiana District Courts prior rulings related to culpability and allocation of fault, the Company currently cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any such penalty to be assessed or determine a reasonable range of potential loss if the matter is resolved by the Louisiana District Court following trial. However, given the Companys lack of direct operational involvement in the event, the Louisiana District Courts rulings excluding any evidence of Anadarkos alleged culpability or fault, the Phase I Findings and Conclusions that did not allocate any fault to Anadarko, and the subjective criteria of the CWA, the Company believes that any CWA penalties assessed to it will not materially impact the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
124 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, 2013, AND 2012 17.  Contingencies (Continued) Events or factors that could assist the Company in estimating the amount of settlement or potential civil penalty or a range of potential loss related to such penalty include (i)an assessment by the DOJ, (ii)a ruling by a court of competent jurisdiction, or (iii)substantive settlement negotiations between the Company and the DOJ.
As discussed below, numerous Deepwater Horizon event-related civil lawsuits have been filed against BP and other parties, including the Company. Certain state and local governments appealed, or provided indication of a likely appeal of, the Louisiana District Courts decision that only federal law, and not state law, applies to Deepwater Horizon event-related claims. For example, eleven Louisiana Parish District Attorneys appealed that decision to the Fifth Circuit. In February2014, the Fifth Circuit denied the appeal and upheld the Louisiana District Courts decision. In October2014, the United States Supreme Court denied the Parish District Attorneys petition to review the case. While that denial ends further appeal of that decision by the eleven Parish District Attorneys, any other party subject to the decision who has not yet appealed, including private parties who opted out of the BP settlement, the states, and other local governments, may do so after obtaining a final judgment on their damages claims. If any further appeal is taken and is successful, state and/or local laws and regulations could become sources of penalties or fines against theCompany.
Natural Resource Damages This category includes future damage claims that may be made by federal and/or state natural resource trustee agencies at the completion of injury assessments and restoration planning. Natural resources generally include land, fish, water, air, wildlife, and other such resources belonging to, managed by, held in trust by, or otherwise controlled by, the federal, state, or local government.
The NRD-assessment process is led by government agencies that act as trustees of natural resources on behalf of the public. Government agencies involved in the process include the Department of Commerce, the Department of the Interior (DOI), and the Department of Defense. These governmental departments, along with the five affected states  Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas  are referred to as the Co-Trustees. The Co-Trustees continue to conduct injury assessment and restoration planning.
The DOJ civil lawsuit filed against BP, the Company, and others seeks unspecified damages for injury to federal natural resources. Not all of the Co-Trustees were a party to this lawsuit; however, during the second quarter of 2011, the states of Alabama and Louisiana each filed NRD-related state law claims against the Company in the Louisiana District Court. In November 2011, after ruling that only federal law applies, the Louisiana District Court dismissed all the NRD-related state law claims asserted against the Company by the states of Alabama and Louisiana. In April 2013, the states of Texas and Mississippi filed NRD-related state law claims against the Company, which were consolidated in the federal Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) action before the Louisiana District Court discussed below and are stayed until further order of the Louisiana District Court.
NRD claims are generally sought after the damage assessment and restoration planning is completed, which may take several years. Thus, the Company remains unable to reasonably estimate the magnitude of any NRD claim. The Company anticipates that BP will satisfy any NRD claim, which eliminates any potential liability to Anadarko for such costs. In the event any NRD damage claim is made directly against Anadarko, the Company is fully indemnified by BP against such claims (including guarantees by BPCNA or BP p.l.c.).
Civil Litigation Damage Claims Numerous Deepwater Horizon event-related civil lawsuits have been filed against BP and other parties, including the Company by, among others, fishing, boating, and shrimping enterprises and industry groups; restaurants; commercial and residential property owners; certain rig workers or their families; the States of Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi, and several of their political subdivisions; the DOJ; environmental non-governmental organizations; and certain Mexican states. Many of the lawsuits filed assert various claims of negligence, gross negligence, and violations of several federal and state laws and regulations, including, among others, OPA; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Clean Air Act; the CWA; and the Endangered Species Act; or challenge existing permits for operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Generally, the plaintiffs are seeking actual damages, punitive damages, declaratory judgment, and/or injunctive relief.
125 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, 2013, AND 2012 17.  Contingencies (Continued) This litigation has been consolidated into a federal MDL action pending before Judge Carl Barbier in the Louisiana District Court. In March 2012, BP and the Plaintiffs Steering Committee (PSC) entered into a settlement agreement to resolve a substantial majority of the economic loss and medical claims stemming from the Deepwater Horizon events, which the Louisiana District Court approved in orders issued in December2012 and January2013. Only OPA claims seeking economic loss damages against the Company remain. In addition, other than those who previously appealed unsuccessfully, certain state and local governments have provided indication of a likely appeal of the Louisiana District Courts decision that only federal law, and not state law, applies to Deepwater Horizon event-related claims. Certain Mexican states also have appealed the dismissal of their claims against BP, the Company, and others. The Company, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, is fully indemnified by BP against losses arising as a result of claims for damages, irrespective of whether such claims are based on federal (including OPA) or state law.
The first phase of the trial in the MDL (Phase I) commenced in February 2013. The PSC, BP, BP America Production Company (BPAP), BP p.l.c., the United States, state and local governments, Halliburton Energy Services, Inc. (Halliburton), and certain subsidiaries of Transocean Ltd. (Transocean) participated in Phase I. Anadarko was excused from participation in PhaseI. The issues tried in Phase I included the cause of the blowout and all related events leading up to April22,2010, the date the Deepwater Horizon sank, as well as allocation of fault. In September2014, the Louisiana District Court issued its Phase I Findings and Conclusions. The Louisiana District Court found that BP and BPAP, Transocean, and Halliburton, but not Anadarko, are each liable under general maritime law for the blowout, explosion, and oil spill. The court determined that BPs and BPAPs conduct was reckless and that both Transoceans and Halliburtons conduct was negligent. The Louisiana District Court apportioned 67% of the fault to BP and BPAP, 30% to Transocean, and 3% to Halliburton.
No fault was allocated to Anadarko. BP is challenging certain of the Louisiana District Courts findings.
The second phase of trial (Phase II) began in September2013 and in November2013 the parties rested their Phase II cases. The issues tried in PhaseII included spill-source control and quantification of the spill for the period from April20,2010, until the well was capped. The Company, the PSC, BP, BPAP, BP p.l.c., the United States, state and local governments, Halliburton, and Transocean participated in Phase II of the trial. In January2015, the Louisiana District Court issued its Phase II Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. The Louisiana District Court found that, for purposes of calculating the maximum possible civil penalty under the CWA, 3.19million barrels of oil were discharged into the Gulf of Mexico.
The penalty phase of the trial began in January2015. Post-trial briefs are due in March and April 2015. The trial included Anadarko, BP, and the United States, and will assess findings and penalties under the CWA. In March2014, the Louisiana District Court ruled that no evidence of Anadarkos alleged culpability or fault could be presented during the penalty phase trial.
The State of Alabama previously brought actions against the Company and other parties for claims arising from the Deepwater Horizon event, including claims for penalties and fines under state environmental laws, which were subsequently dismissed by the Louisiana District Court. The Louisiana District Court has selected this case as its test case for valuing the damages sought by states for claims under federal laws arising from the Deepwater Horizon event. Trial is set for November2015 and the parties are conducting discovery. The Louisiana District Courts previous rulings apply to Alabamas claims, including the courts decision that only federal law, and not state law, applies; its decision allocating fault and liability among BP and BPAP, Transocean, and Halliburton; and its orders precluding evidence of alleged culpability by Anadarko, leaving only damages to be decided. The Company, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, is fully indemnified by BP against losses arising as a result of claims for damages.
126 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, 2013, AND 2012 17.  Contingencies (Continued) Two separate class-action complaints were filed in June and August 2010, in the New York District Court on behalf of purported purchasers of the Companys stock between June12,2009, and June9,2010, against Anadarko and certain of its officers. The consolidated action was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas - Houston Division (Texas District Court). The complaints allege causes of action arising pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for purported misstatements and omissions regarding, among other things, the Companys liability related to the Deepwater Horizon events. The plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, including interest thereon, as well as litigation fees and costs. In March2014, the parties reached a settlement in this matter, which was approved by the Texas District Court in September2014. The settlement was directly funded by the Companys insurers.
Remaining Liability Outlook It is possible that the Company may recognize additional Deepwater Horizon event-related liabilities for potential fines and penalties and certain other claims not covered by the indemnification provisions of the Settlement Agreement; however, the Company does not believe that any potential liability attributable to the foregoing items, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. This assessment takes into account certain qualitative factors, including the subjective and fault-based nature of CWA penalties, the Companys indemnification by BP against certain damage claims as discussed above and BPs creditworthiness.
Although the Company is fully indemnified by BP against OPA damage claims, NRD claims and assessment costs, and certain other potential liabilities, the Company may be required to recognize a liability for these amounts in advance of or in connection with recognizing a receivable from BP for the related indemnity payment. In all circumstances, however, the Company expects that any additional indemnified liability that may be recognized by the Company will be subsequently recovered from BP itself or through the guarantees of BPCNA or BP p.l.c.
The Company will continue to monitor the MDL and other legal proceedings discussed above as well as federal investigations related to the Deepwater Horizon events. The Company cannot predict the nature of additional evidence that may be discovered during the course of legal proceedings or the timing of completion of any legal proceedings.
Deepwater Horizon and Tronox Derivative Claims In May2013, an Anadarko shareholder filed a derivative action in the 215 th District Court of Harris County, Texas (215 th District Court) against Anadarko and certain current and former directors and officers (DWH Derivative Action). The shareholder purported to bring claims on behalf of Anadarko and alleged, among other things, that certain current and former directors and officers breached their fiduciary duty in connection with the Companys investment in the Macondo lease.
In addition, in April 2014, the Companys Board of Directors received a letter from a current shareholder demanding that the Board undertake an independent investigation of certain current and former officers and directors for alleged breach of fiduciary duty related to the Companys April 2014 settlement of the Tronox Adversary Proceeding (Tronox Derivative Demand).
In May 2014, the parties reached an agreement to jointly resolve the DWH Derivative Action and the Tronox Derivative Demand in one settlement. In order to achieve the joint settlement, the petition in the DWH Derivative Action was amended to include the allegations asserted in the Tronox Derivative Demand. In August2014, the 215 th District Court approved the settlement. The settlement did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Contingencies (Continued) Other Litigation In December2008, Anadarko sold its interest in the Peregrino heavy-oil field offshore Brazil. The Company is currently litigating a dispute with the Brazilian tax authorities regarding the tax rate applicable to the transaction. Currently, $128 million , the amount of tax originally in dispute, resides in a judicially controlled Brazilian bank account pending final resolution of the matter and is included in other assets on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December31,2014 .
In July2009, the lower judicial court ruled in favor of the Brazilian tax authorities. The Company appealed this decision to the Brazilian Regional courts, which upheld the lower courts ruling in favor of the Brazilian tax authorities in December2011. In April2012, the Company filed simultaneous appeals to the Brazilian Superior Court and the Brazilian Supreme Court. The Brazilian Superior Court and the Brazilian Supreme Court have agreed to hear the case and the Company currently is awaiting the setting of initial hearing dates. In August 2013, following a determination by an administrative court in a related matter that the amount of tax in dispute was not calculated properly, the Company filed a petition requesting the withdrawal of a portion of the judicial deposit to the extent it exceeds $42million , the amount of tax currently in dispute, and any interest on such amount.
The Company believes that it will more likely than not prevail in Brazilian courts. Therefore, no tax liability has been recorded for Peregrino divestiture-related litigation at December31,2014 . The Company continues to vigorously defend its position in Brazilian courts.
Guarantees and Indemnifications The Company provides certain indemnifications in relation to asset dispositions. These indemnifications typically relate to disputes, litigation, or tax matters existing at the date of disposition. In 2013, as a result of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy declaration by a third party, the DOI ordered Anadarko to perform the decommissioning of a production facility and related wells, which were previously sold to the third party. During 2013, the Company accrued costs of $117million to decommission the production facility and related wells, reported in other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income. During 2014, the Company recognized a $22 million increase in the estimated decommissioning costs. Anadarko completed decommissioning of the production facility in 2014 and expects to complete decommissioning of the wells in 2015. Decommissioning obligations of $114million were included in accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December31,2014 . Actual costs may vary from this estimate; however, the Company does not believe that any such change will materially impact its financial condition, results of operations, or cashflows.
Environmental Matters Anadarko is also subject to various environmental-remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state, and local laws and regulations. The Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets include liabilities for remediation and reclamation obligations of $126 million at December31,2014 and December31,2013 . The current portion of these amounts was included in accounts payable and the long-term portion of these amounts was included in other long-term liabilities  other on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company continually monitors remediation and reclamation processes and adjusts its liability for these obligations as necessary.
The Company is one of numerous parties previously notified by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) that, as a result of a prior acquisition, it is a potentially responsible party with respect to a landfill located in West Covina, California. While no agreement is in place with the DTSC, the Company recorded a $50million restoration liability in 2013 with respect to the site, representing the current estimated obligation, which is included in the Companys liability balance at December31,2014. The Company could incur additional obligations if any of the potentially responsible parties are ultimately not able to fund their allocated share of the costs or if the DTSC requires a more costly remedial approach. It is possible that the Companys current estimate of probable loss related to this matter could change, perhaps materially, in the future.

Also included in the 2014 ending balance are benefits of $8million related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain, but the timing of such deductibility is uncertain.
131 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, 2013, AND 2012 18.  Income Taxes (Continued) In 2013, the Company recognized a deferred tax benefit of $274 million related to the $850 million loss for the Tronox-related contingent liability. In 2014, the Company recognized a deferred tax benefit of $316 million related to the additional $4.360 billion loss for the Tronox-related contingent liability. The total deferred tax benefit of $590million is net of a $1.326 billion uncertain tax position due to the uncertainty related to the deductibility of the settlement payment. This uncertain tax position is presented in deferred income taxes and as a reduction to the associated deferred tax asset. The Company is a participant in the U.S. Internal Revenue Services (IRS) Compliance Assurance Process and has regular discussions with the IRS concerning the Companys tax positions. Depending on the outcome of such discussions, it is reasonably possible that the amount of the uncertain tax position related to the settlement could change, perhaps materially. See Note17Contingencies Tronox Litigation .
Income tax audits and the Companys acquisition and divestiture activity have given rise to tax disputes in U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. See Note17Contingencies Other Litigation.
The Company estimates that $120million to $130million of unrecognized tax benefits related to adjustments to taxable income and credits previously recorded pursuant to the accounting standard for accounting for tax uncertainties will reverse within the next 12 months due to expiration of statutes of limitation and audit settlements. Management does not believe that the final resolution of outstanding tax audits and litigation will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
The Company had accrued approximately $9 million of interest related to uncertain tax positions at December31,2014 , and $8 million at December31,2013 . The Company recognized interest and penalties in income tax expense (benefit) of $1million during 2014 and $(20) million during 2013 .
Anadarko is subject to audit by tax authorities in the U.S. federal, state, and local tax jurisdictions as well as in various foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currently under routine examination by the IRS for the tax years 2008 through 2014 .

Segment Information Anadarkos business segments are separately managed due to distinct operational differences and unique technology, distribution, and marketing requirements. The Companys three reporting segments are oil and gas exploration and production, midstream, and marketing. The oil and gas exploration and production segment explores for and produces natural gas, oil, condensate, and NGLs, and plans for the development and operation of the Companys LNG project in Mozambique. The midstream segment engages in gathering, processing, treating, and transporting Anadarko and third-party oil, natural-gas, and NGLs production. The midstream reporting segment consists of two operating segments, WES and other midstream, which are aggregated into one reporting segment due to similar financial andoperating characteristics. The marketing segment sells much of Anadarkos oil, natural-gas, and NGLs production, as well as third-party purchased volumes.
133 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, 2013, AND 2012 20.  Segment Information (Continued) To assess the performance of Anadarkos operating segments, the chief operating decision maker analyzes Adjusted EBITDAX. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDAX as income (loss) before income taxes; exploration expense; DD&A; impairments; interest expense; total (gains) losses on derivatives, net, less net cash from settlement of commodity derivatives; and certain items not related to the Companys normal operations, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. During the periods presented, items not related to the Companys normal operations included Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs, Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement, Tronox-related contingent loss, and certain other nonoperating items included in other (income) expense, net. The Companys definition of Adjusted EBITDAX excludes exploration expense as it is not an indicator of operating efficiency for a given reporting period. However, exploration expense is monitored by management as part of costs incurred in exploration and development activities. Similarly, DD&A and impairments are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX as a measure of segment operating performance because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. Adjusted EBITDAX also excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating results without regard to Anadarkos financing methods or capital structure. Total (gains) losses on derivatives, net, less net cash from settlement of commodity derivatives are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX because these (gains) losses are not considered a measure of asset operating performance. Finally, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is excluded from the Companys measure of Adjusted EBITDAX because it represents earnings that are not attributable to the Companys common stockholders.
Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX provides information useful in assessing the Companys financial condition and results of operations and that Adjusted EBITDAX is a widely accepted financial indicator of a companys ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures, and make distributions to stockholders. Adjusted EBITDAX as defined by Anadarko may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and other performance measures, such as operating income or cash flows from operating activities. Below is a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX to income (loss) before income taxes for the years endedDecember31: millions 2014 2013 2012 Income (loss) before income taxes $ 54 $ 2,106 $ 3,565 Exploration expense 1,639 1,329 1,946 DD&A 4,550 3,927 3,964 Impairments 836 794 389 Interest expense 772 686 742 Total (gains) losses on derivatives, net, less net cash from settlement of commodity derivatives 578 (307 ) 443 Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs 97 15 18 Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement  33 (1,797 ) Tronox-related contingent loss 4,360 850 (250 ) Certain other nonoperating items 22 110  Less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 187 140 54 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX $ 12,721 $ 9,403 $ 8,966 134 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, 2013, AND 2012 20.  Segment Information (Continued) The Companys accounting policies for individual segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies, with the following exception: certain intersegment commodity contracts may meet the GAAP definition of a derivative instrument, which would be accounted for at fair value under GAAP. However, Anadarko does not recognize any mark-to-market adjustments on such intersegment arrangements. Additionally, intersegment asset transfers are accounted for at historical cost basis, and do not give rise to gain or loss recognition.
Information presented below as Other and Intersegment Eliminations includes corporate costs, results from hard-minerals royalties, and net cash from settlement of commodity derivatives.

21.  Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits, and Defined-Contribution Plans The Company has contributory and non-contributory defined-benefit pension plans, which include both qualified and supplemental plans. The Company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees. Retiree health care benefits are funded by contributions from the retiree, and in certain circumstances, contributions from the Company. The Companys retiree life insurance plan is non-contributory.
While reported benefit obligations exceed the fair value of pension and other postretirement plan assets at December31,2014 , the Company monitors the status of its funded pension plans to ensure that plan funds are sufficient to continue paying benefits. During 2014 , the Company made contributions of $106 million to its funded pension plans, $15million to its unfunded pension plans, and $15million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. Contributions to funded plans increase plan assets while contributions to unfunded plans are used to fund current benefit payments. The Company expects to contribute $5million to its funded pension plans, $24 million to its unfunded pension plans, and $16million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans in 2015 .

Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits, and Defined-Contribution Plans (Continued) Accumulated and projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of future cash payments. The Company discounts those cash payments using a discount rate that reflects the weighted average of market-observed yields for select high-quality (AA-rated) fixed-income securities with cash flows that correspond to the expected amounts and timing of benefit payments. The discount-rate assumption used by the Company represents an estimateof the interest rate at which the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date. Assumed rates of compensation increases for active participants vary by age group, with theresulting weighted-average assumed rate (weighted by the plan-level benefit obligation) provided in the precedingtable.

This rate is expected to gradually decrease to 5.00% in 2020 and beyond. The assumed health care cost trend rate can have a significant effect on the cost and obligation amounts reported for the health care plan. A 1% change in the assumed health care cost trend rate over the projected period would have the following effects: millions 1%Increase 1%Decrease Effect on total of service and interest cost components $ 3 $ (2 ) Effect on other postretirement benefit obligation $ 40 $ (33 ) 140 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, 2013, AND 2012 21.  Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits, and Defined-Contribution Plans (Continued) Plan Assets Investment Policies and Strategies The Company has adopted a balanced, diversified investment strategy, with the intent of maximizing returns without exposure to undue risk. Investments are typically made through investment managers across several investment categories (domestic equity securities, international equity securities, fixed-income securities, real estate, hedge funds, and private equity), with selective exposure to Growth/Value investment styles. Performance for each investment is measured relative to the appropriate index benchmark for its category. Target asset-allocation percentages by major category are 45% - 55% equity securities, 20% - 30% fixed income, and up to 25% in a combination of other investments such as real estate, hedge funds, and private equity. Investment managers have full discretion as to investment decisions regarding funds under their management to the extent permitted within investment guidelines.
Although investment managers may, at their discretion and within investment guidelines, invest in Anadarko securities, there are no direct investments in Anadarko securities included in plan assets. There may be, however, indirect investments in Anadarko securities through the plans collective fund investments. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption was determined using the year-end 2014 pension investment balances by asset class and expected long-term asset allocation. The expected return for each asset class reflects capital-market projections formulated using a forward-looking building-block approach, while also taking into account historical return trends and current market conditions. Equity returns generally reflect long-term expectations of real earnings growth, dividend yield, and inflation. Returns on fixed-income securities are generally developed based on expected inflation, real bond yield, and risk spread (as appropriate), adjusted for the expected effect that changing yields haveon the rate of return. Other asset-class returns are derived from their relationship to the equity and fixed-income markets.

Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits, and Defined-Contribution Plans (Continued) Investments in securities traded in active markets are measured based on quoted prices, which represent Level 1 inputs. Investments based on Level 2 inputs include direct investments in corporate debt and other fixed-income securities, as well as shares of open-end mutual funds or similar investment vehicles that do not have a readily determinable fair value, but are valued at the net asset value per share (NAV). For such funds, the NAV is the value at which investors transact with the fund, and is determined by the fund based on the estimated fair values of the underlying fund assets. Fair value of investments included as Level 3 inputs generally also reflect investments valued at fund NAVs, but, unlike investments characteristic of Level 2 fair-value measurements, such plan assets have significant liquidity restrictions or other features that are not reflected in NAV.

Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, it is possible that changes in the values of investment securities could significantly impact the plan assets.
The plan assets may include securities with contractual cash flows, such as asset-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, and commercial mortgage-backed securities, including securities backed by subprime mortgage loans. The value, liquidity, and related income of those securities are sensitive to changes in economic conditions, including real estate values, delinquencies or defaults, or both, and may be adversely affected by shifts in the markets perception of the issuers and changes in interest rates.

All regular employees of the Company on its U.S. payroll are eligible to participate in the ESP by making elective contributions that are matched by the Company, subject to certain limitations. The Company recognized expense of $76 million for 2014 , $78 million for 2013 , and $55 million for 2012 , related to these plans.
144 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES (Unaudited) The unaudited supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities for 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 has been presented in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive ActivitiesOil and Gas and the Securities and Exchange Commissions final rule, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting . Disclosures by geographic area include the United States and International. The International geographic area consists of proved reserves located in Algeria and Ghana. The Company sold its Chinese subsidiary during 2014.
Oil and Gas Reserves The following reserves disclosures reflect estimates of proved reserves, proved developed reserves, and proved undeveloped reserves, net of third-party royalty interests, of natural gas, oil, condensate, and natural-gas liquids (NGLs) owned at each year end and changes in proved reserves during each of the last three years. Natural-gas volumes are presented inbillions of cubic feet (Bcf) at a pressure base of 14.73 pounds per square inch and volumes for oil, condensate, and NGLs are presented inmillions of barrels (MMBbls). Total volumes are presented inmillions of barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE). For this computation, one barrel is the equivalent of 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas. Shrinkage associated with NGLs has been deducted from the natural-gas reserves volumes.
Reserves for international locations are calculated in accordance with the terms of governing agreements. The international reserves include estimated quantities allocated to Anadarko for recovery of costs and income taxes and Anadarkos net equity share after recovery of such costs.
The Companys estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. The results of infill drilling are treated as positive revisions due to increases to expected recovery. Other revisions are due to changes in, among other things, development plans, reservoir performance, commodity prices, economic conditions, and governmental restrictions.
Prices used to compute the information presented in the following tables are adjusted only for fixed and determinable amounts under provisions in existing contracts. These prices, before adjustments, were $4.35 , $3.67 , and $2.76 perMMBtu of natural gas and $94.99 , $96.78 , and $94.71 perbarrelofoil for 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 . The benchmark price for NGLs used in the computation, previously the same as that for oil, was converted to a NGLs-specific price of $45.25 per barrel in 2014 .

147 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES (Unaudited) In 2014 , Anadarko added 63 MMBOE of proved reserves through extensions and discoveries primarily as a result of successful drilling in the Marcellus and Wolfcamp shale plays. Although shale plays represented only about 17% of the Companys total proved reserves at December31,2014 , growth in the shale plays contributed 49 MMBOE, or 78% , of the total extensions and discoveries. Total revisions include the effects of new infill drilling, changes in commodity prices and other updates reflecting changes in economic conditions, changes in reservoir performance, and changes to development plans. Total revisions in 2014 resulted in an increase of 439 MMBOE, or 16% , of the beginning-of-year reserves base. These revisions are primarily associated with a 577 MMBOE increase related to successful infill drilling in large onshore areas such as the Wattenberg area and the Eagleford and Haynesville shales. Partially offsetting these positive infill revisions was a net decrease of 138 MMBOE, primarily associated with the optimization of horizontal drilling locations and the discontinuation of vertical well workover plans in the Wattenberg area. In 2014 , the Company sold properties or interests in properties containing 69MMBOE of proved developed reserves and 55MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves. Sales included the divestiture of the Companys interest in the Pinedale/Jonah assets in Wyoming, the Companys Chinese subsidiary, and a portion of the Companys working interest in the East Texas Chalk area.
In 2013, Anadarko added 145MMBOE of proved reserves through extensions and discoveries as the result of successful drilling primarily in the Marcellus shale and the Gulf of Mexico. Although shale plays represented only about 13% of the Companys total proved reserves at December31,2013, growth in the shale plays contributed 70MMBOE, or 48%, of the total extensions and discoveries. Total revisions in 2013 resulted in an increase of 347MMBOE, or 14%, of the beginning-of-year reserves base. Total 2013 revisions included an increase of 410MMBOE related to successful infill drilling, primarily in large onshore areas such as Wattenberg, Greater Natural Buttes, and the Eagleford shale, and 30MMBOE resulting from improved oil and natural-gas prices. Partially offsetting these positive revisions were decreases of 53MMBbls of NGLs reserves due to lower ethane prices and 40MMBOE due to other non-price-related revisions primarily in the Rocky Mountains Region (Rockies). In 2013, the Company sold U.S. properties or interests in U.S. properties containing 12MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves. Sales were almost exclusively associated with a partial sale of a working interest in the Gulf of Mexico Heidelberg development project. Acquisitions of proved reserves were 36MMBOE, related to domestic assets almost exclusively in the Rockies.
In 2012, Anadarko added 82MMBOE of proved reserves through extensions and discoveries as the result of successful drilling in the Marcellus shale and the Gulf of Mexico. Shale plays contributed 66MMBOE of the total extensions and discoveries in2012. Total revisions in 2012 were 284 MMBOE or 11% of the beginning-of-year reserves base. Total 2012 revisions included an increase of 383 MMBOE related to successful infill drilling, primarily in Greater Natural Buttes, Wattenberg, and Carthage, and 33 MMBOE resulting from the resolution of the Algeria exceptional profits tax dispute. Partially offsetting these positive revisions were decreases of 68 MMBOE due to lower commodity prices, 56 MMBOE at Wattenberg primarily due to removing reserves associated with the discontinued vertical drilling program, and 8 MMBOE from all other assets. In 2012, the Company sold U.S. properties or interests in U.S. properties containing 81MMBOE of proved reserves, including 59MMBOE of proved developed reserves and 22MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves. Sales included a portion of the Companys working interests in the Rockies Salt Creek enhanced oil recovery project and the Gulf of Mexico Lucius development project, and asset divestitures in South Texas, West Texas, the Gulf of Mexico, the Rockies, and North Louisiana.

Net revenues from production include only the revenues from the production and sale of natural gas, oil, condensate, and NGLs. Gains (losses) on property dispositions represent net gains or losses on sales of oil and gas properties. Production costs are costs to operate and maintain the Companys wells, related equipment, and supporting facilities used in oil and gas operations, including the cost of labor, well service and repair, location maintenance, power and fuel, gathering, processing, transportation, other taxes, and production-related general and administrative costs. Exploration expenses include dry hole costs, leasehold impairments, geological and geophysical expenses, and the costs of retaining unproved leaseholds. Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement represents the Companys resolution of the Algeria exceptional profits tax dispute with Sonatrach, which provided for the transfer of $1.7billion of oil to the Company over a 12-month period ending in mid-2013. Income tax expense is calculated by applying the current statutory tax rates to the revenues after deducting costs, which include depreciation, depletion, and amortization allowances, after giving effect to permanent differences. The results of operations exclude general office overhead and interest expense attributable to oil and gas activities.

Prices used to compute the information presented in the tables below are adjusted only for fixed and determinable amounts under provisions in existing contracts. These prices, before adjustments, were $4.35 , $3.67 , and $2.76 per MMBtu of natural gas and $94.99 , $96.78 , and $94.71 per barrel of oil, for 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 . The benchmark price for NGLs used in the computation, previously the same as that for oil, was converted to a NGLs-specific price of $45.25 per barrel in 2014 . Estimated future net cash flows for all periods presented are reduced by estimated future development, production, and abandonment and dismantlement costs based on existing costs, assuming continuation of existing economic conditions, and by estimated future income tax expense. These estimates also include assumptions about the timing of future production of proved reserves, and timing of future development, production costs, and abandonment and dismantlement. Income tax expense, both U.S. and foreign, is calculated by applying the existing statutory tax rates, including any known future changes, to the pretax net cash flows, giving effect to any permanent differences and reduced by the applicable tax basis. The effect of tax credits is considered in determining the income tax expense. The 10% discount factor is prescribed by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
The present value of future net cash flows is not an estimate of the fair value of Anadarkos proved reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, anticipated changes in future prices and costs, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves, and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and natural gas. Significant changes in estimated reserves volumes or commodity prices could have a material effect on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
