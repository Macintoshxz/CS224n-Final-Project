Operating Outlook During 2015, the oil and natural-gas industry experienced a significant decrease in commodity prices driven by a global supply/demand imbalance for oil and an oversupply of natural gas in the United States. The decline in commodity prices and global economic conditions have continued into 2016, and low commodity prices may exist for an extended period.
The Company plans to continue its disciplined and focused approach in 2016 by emphasizing value over growth, enhancing operational efficiencies, reducing capital expenses, and managing its diverse asset portfolio. Management has recommended to the Board of Directors (Board) a 2016 capital budget of approximately $2.8billion, which excludes the capital budget of Western Gas Partners, LP (WES), a publicly traded consolidated subsidiary. The $2.8billion budget is nearly 50% lower than capital investments in 2015 and almost 70% lower than 2014.
The Company will continue to evaluate the oil and natural-gas price environments and may adjust its capital spending plans to maintain the appropriate liquidity and financial flexibility. Anadarko expects that its capital expenditures will be aligned with its cash flows from operations and targeted asset monetizations.
3 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES AND ACTIVITIES The map below illustrates the locations of Anadarkos significant oil and natural-gas exploration and production operations: 4 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements United States Overview Anadarkos U.S. operations include oil and natural-gas exploration and production in the onshore Lower 48 states, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and onshore Alaska. The Companys U.S. operations accounted for 89% of sales volumes and 80% of sales revenues during 2015 , and 90% of proved reserves at year-end 2015 .
Rocky Mountains Region Anadarkos Rocky Mountains Region (Rockies) properties include oil and natural-gas plays located in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming, where the Company operates approximately 11,000wells and owns interests in approximately 4,000nonoperated wells. Anadarko operates fractured-carbonate/shale reservoirs and tight-gas assets within the region. The Company also has fee ownership of mineral rights under approximately eightmillion acres that pass through Colorado and Wyoming and into Utah (known as the Land Grant). Management considers the Land Grant a significant competitive advantage for Anadarko as it enhances the Companys economic returns from production, offers drilling opportunities for the Company without expiration, and allows the Company to capture royalty revenue from third-party activity on Land Grant acreage. The Company also believes its liquids-rich reservoirs, strong well performance, low development and operating costs, and large expandable midstream infrastructure each provide tangible benefits to the Company.
In 2015, activities in the Rockies primarily focused on production and adding reserves through horizontal drilling, infill drilling, and optimizing both wellbore and completion design. In addition, a major emphasis was placed on reducing capital and operating expenses and increasing efficiencies to enhance margins. In 2015 , Rockies liquids sales volumes increased by 11% over 2014 , equivalent to 17thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d), even with a reduction in sales volumes of 21MBOE/d related to the impact of ethane rejection. The Company drilled 447wells and completed 390wells in the Rockies during 2015 , primarily in the Wattenberg field, which is expected to be a focus area for Anadarko in 2016.
5 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Wattenberg Anadarko operates approximately 5,000vertical wells and 1,000horizontal wells in the Wattenberg field. The field contains the Niobrara and Codell formations, which are naturally fractured formations that hold both liquids and natural gas. During 2015 , the Companys drilling program focused entirely on horizontal development, drilling 365horizontal wells. Sales volumes in the field increased 32% compared to 2014 , with increases of 29% in oil volumes and 27% in total liquids volumes. Horizontal drilling results in the field continue to be strong, with economics that are enhanced by the Companys ownership of the Land Grant mineral interest, a consolidated core acreage position, and recent enhancements to the operated and controlled infrastructure and takeaway capacity.
Drilling spud-to-rig-release cycle time improved from 10.5days in 2014 to 6.3days in 2015. The full-year 2015 average drilling cost per foot was reduced by approximately 40% and completion capital was reduced by 32% relative to 2014. Operated well capital costs in 2015 have decreased to less than $3.5million from $4.0million in 2014 for an equivalent well, driven by continued operational efficiencies and supply-chain savings. During 2015, Anadarko intentionally deferred completions in order to focus on preserving value by decreasing capital investments in a lower commodity-price environment and to provide additional production flexibility for 2016.
In 2015, the second cryogenic processing train at the Lancaster plant was placed into service, resulting in an additional 300million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of processing capacity and a field-wide increase in NGLs recoveries. The Company made substantial progress toward completion of its centralized oil stabilization facility (COSF) in 2015 and expects to commission the facility in early 2016. The COSF will increase oil recoveries, enhance efficiencies of tank batteries, lower operating expenses, and further reduce impacts on the environment. Anadarko added 180MMcf/d of field compression in 2015, which reduced gathering system pressures in the field, enhancing system efficiency and improving the base production profile.
Greater Natural Buttes The Greater Natural Buttes area in eastern Utah is one of the Companys major tight-gas assets. The Company uses cryogenic processing facilities in this area to extract NGLs from the natural-gas stream. The Company operates approximately 2,900wells in the area and drilled 60 wells in 2015 . Average drilling cost per foot was reduced by 10% and completion capital was reduced by 23% relative to 2014. The Company operated the field at a reduced activity level for the majority of 2015 due to capital being diverted to higher-margin projects.
Powder River Deep The Company drilled a three-well exploration/appraisal program targeting the Turner formation, where the Company has previously seen strong results. Additionally, a farm-out agreement was reached during the first quarter of 2015, whereby Anadarko may be carried in at least three deep horizontal tests to further evaluate multiple oil objectives. The farm-in party has the option to earn up to 40,000net acres of Anadarkos position. The Company controls over 325,000acres of deep mineral rights within the Powder River basin.
Laramie County Anadarko holds ownership in more than 100,000mineral-interest acres in this emerging liquids-rich play in the northern DJ basin in Wyoming. In 2015, the Company participated in more than 70nonoperated wells testing the Niobrara and Codell formations. Results from 33producing wells, 11 with first production in 2015, remain strong, with initial 30-day net production averagingapproximately 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d).
Greater Green River Basin Anadarko operates over 1,400wells in the Wamsutter and Moxa fields. The Company also carries a nonoperated position in 2,600wells across the two fields. Much of this producing area is located within the Land Grant, which enhances the Companys economics in projects in the area. Anadarko reached a farm-out agreement in July2015, whereby the Company will be fully carried on several exploration wells testing a liquids-rich opportunity located on the Land Grant.
Coalbed Methane Properties During 2015, Anadarko sold its interest in its Powder River basin coalbed methane wells and related midstream assets for net proceeds of $154 million after closing adjustments.
Salt Creek and Monell During 2015, Anadarko sold its interest in the Salt Creek and Monell enhanced oil recovery assets in Wyoming, with a sales price of $703 million, for net proceeds of $675 million after closing adjustments.
6 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Southern and Appalachia Region Anadarkos Southern and Appalachia Region properties are primarily located in Texas, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, and Kansas. The region includes the Eagleford shale in South Texas, the Delaware basin in West Texas, the Marcellus shale in north-central Pennsylvania, and the Haynesville shale in East Texas and Northern Louisiana. Operations in these areas are focused on finding and developing both natural gas and liquids from shales, tight sands, and fractured-reservoir plays.
During 2015 , the Company continued to focus on improving its cost structure, delivering efficient production, and delineating its position in the Delaware basin. Activities in the region targeted continued drilling, completion and operational efficiencies, and process improvements and optimization, providing both lower costs and cycle-time improvements across the region. Compared with the prior year, capital expenditures were reduced in the region as the Company focused on higher-margin areas within the U.S. onshore to support future growth. Additional production flexibility for 2016 was provided by infrastructure expansions primarily in the Delaware basin, reductions in completion costs across the region, and the systematic buildup of intentionally deferred completions in the Eagleford shale and Delaware basin.
In 2015 , liquids sales volumes in the region increased by 10% , although a decrease in gas sales volumes resulted in a total sales volume decrease of 5% from 2014 . The Company drilled 338operated horizontal wells and brought 318wells online in 2015 . In July2015, Anadarko sold its interest in the Bossier natural-gas field and associated midstream assets in East Texas, with a sales price of $440 million , for net proceeds of $425 million after closing adjustments. In 2016 , the Company expects to continue its horizontal drilling program, focusing on the Delaware basin.
7 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Delaware Basin Anadarko holds interests in over 600,000gross acres in the Delaware basin. Anadarkos 2015 drilling activity primarily targeted the Wolfcamp shale play, liquids-rich Bone Spring 2 tight sands, and the Avalon shale play. In 2015 , Anadarko drilled 80operated wells and participated in 49nonoperated wells. Significant infrastructure continues to be added to facilitate future growth from this asset. At year-end 2015, the Company had sixoperated rigs drilling in the Wolfcamp shale.
The successful Wolfcamp shale delineation program continues to deliver encouraging results across the majority of Anadarkos acreage position. Anadarko is testing multiple zones within the Wolfcamp shale and several development concepts for increased efficiency, including multi-well pads, extended laterals, and horizontal-well spacing. The Company has identified thousands of potential drilling locations in the Wolfcamp formation that are expected to provide substantial opportunity for Anadarkos future activity in the basin.
Eagleford The Eagleford shale development in South Texas consists of approximately 346,000gross acres and over 1,300producing wells. In 2015, the Company averaged 4drilling rigs, drilled 183wells, completed 179wells, and brought 201wells online, generating sales volume growth of 20% over 2014. In 2015, Anadarko continued to recognize improvements in Eagleford shale drilling efficiency, translating to record-low average cost per foot, while increasing average lateral length. Anadarko completed five successful tests targeting the mid and upper Eagleford shale zones and intends to test for additional reserves acrossits acreage position. The Company also continued to optimize other development parameters such as completions design, spacing, and choke management.
Eaglebine Anadarko holds 156,000gross acres in the Eaglebine shale in Southeast Texas, most of which is held by existing Austin Chalk production. In 2015 , Anadarko continued to delineate and develop this acreage by drilling 24operated horizontal wells with a one-rig program. Under a carried-interest arrangement entered into in 2014, which requires a third party to fund $442million of Anadarkos capital costs in exchange for a 34% working interest in the Eaglebine development, Anadarko has generated positive cash flow in an unfavorable commodity-price environment while testing new concepts and opportunities. At December31, 2015 , $111million of the total $442million carry obligation had been funded.
East Texas/North Louisiana Anadarko holds 223,000gross acres in East Texas/North Louisiana. Anadarko continued its capital program in the East Texas/North Louisiana area in 2015 , targeting the liquids-rich Haynesville shale in East Texas and the prolific dry-gas Haynesville shale in North Louisiana. In 2015 , Anadarko averaged 3.5operated rigs and drilled 39wells in the Haynesville and Cotton Valley formations.
Marcellus The Company holds 625,000gross acres in the Marcellus shale of the Appalachian basin. In 2015, 1operated horizontal well was drilled and Anadarko participated in the drilling of 18nonoperated horizontal wells. The Companys sales volumes in the Marcellus shale decreased in 2015 as the Company reduced its investment and production in the area in response to the lower commodity-price environment and ongoing third-party pipeline infrastructure maintenance.
8 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Gulf of Mexico Anadarko owns an average working interest of 60% in 279blocks in the Gulf of Mexico. The Company operates eight active floating platforms and holds interests in 34fields. During 2015 , the Company advanced development of the Lucius and Heidelberg projects and continued an active deepwater development and appraisal program in the Gulf of Mexico as it continues to take advantage of existing infrastructure to cost-effectively develop known resources.
Development Lucius The Company realized first production at the Anadarko-operated Lucius Spar in January 2015, bringing on sixwells throughout the early part of 2015. The Lucius project was developed with production startup only three years from sanction and five years from discovery. The 80-thousand barrels per day (MBbls/d) spar is located in Keathley Canyon Block 875 at a water depth of 7,000 feet. The Company has realized steady production performance at nameplate capacity since May2015. Anadarko entered into a carried-interest arrangement with a third party in 2012. The $476million carry commitment was fully funded in 2014 and covered a substantial majority of Anadarkos capital costs through first production. Following the carried-interest arrangement and 2014 equity re-determination, the Company holds a 23.8% working interest in Lucius.
Heidelberg During 2015, the Company continued to advance the Anadarko-operated Heidelberg development project, which was sanctioned during the second quarter of 2013. Installation of the Lucius-lookalike spar was completed and first oil was realized in January2016, three months ahead of schedule. Three wells are ready for production and are expected to be brought online during the first quarter of 2016, while an additional two wells are expected to be drilled later in 2016.
In 2013, the Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement requiring a third party to fund $860million of capital costs in exchange for a 12.75%working interest in the project. At December31, 2015 , $793million of the $860million carry obligation had been funded. Anadarko holds a 31.5% working interest in Heidelberg.
9 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Caesar/Tonga At Caesar/Tonga (33.75% working interest), the Company successfully completed a fifth development well (GC 683#2) in the first quarter of 2015. Anadarko has recently completed a sixth development well (GC 683#3), which is expected to come online later in the first quarter of 2016. A seventh well (GC 726#2) reached total depth in January2016 and encountered over 250 net feet of oil pay. The well is currently being completed. Due to the continued success at Caesar/Tonga, the Company sanctioned a Phase2 development plan during the fourth quarter of 2015 and anticipates first oil in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Constitution At Constitution (100% working interest), the Company executed a successful platform drilling program in 2015, where the A4 well was sidetracked, completed, and brought online.
K2 Complex At K2 (41.8% working interest), the GC 562#5 infill well, which found 210net feet of oil pay in the Miocene, was successfully completed. The GC 561#3 development well found 331net feet of oil pay in the M9, M10, and M15 sands and is currently being completed. First production is anticipated by the second quarter of 2016.
Independence Hub Gas Complex The last producing well at Independence Hub (IHUB) watered out in December2015. IHUB was a tremendous asset for the Company with cumulative gross production of 1.3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in eight and a half years. Plans to plug and abandon the remaining IHUB wellbores and decommission the facilities are underway.
Exploration Two nonoperated exploration wells were drilled in the Gulf of Mexico during 2015. The Yeti exploration well (37.5%working interest) targeted a sub-salt Miocene-aged three-way closure in Walker Ridge and encountered more than 270net feet of oil pay. The Yeti discovery is located in approximately 5,900feet of water, approximately 20miles south of Anadarkos operated Heidelberg field. The Thorvald exploration well (50% working interest), located in approximately 4,800feet of water in southern Mississippi Canyon, tested multiple sub-salt Miocene reservoirs in a three-way closure and encountered approximately 80net feet of oil pay.
Appraisal Shenandoah The Company spud the Shenandoah-4 well, the third appraisal well at the Shenandoah discovery (30%working interest), in the second quarter of 2015. The well tested the up-dip extent of the basin. The subsequent Shenandoah-4 sidetrack encountered more than 620net feet of oil pay, extending the lowest known oil column down-dip. Following the success of the Shenandoah-4 sidetrack, the Company and its partners successfully acquired more than 550feet of whole-core from the hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir interval.
Yeti The Yeti discovery well was successfully sidetracked to test the down-dip limits of the field. The Yeti-3 appraisal well finished drilling during the fourth quarter of 2015 and was successful in acquiring more than 320feet of whole-core across the primary Miocene-aged reservoir intervals encountered in the Yeti discovery well. The Company and its partners are currently evaluating potential development options for the Yeti discovery.
Alaska Anadarkos nonoperated oil production and development activity in Alaska is concentrated on the North Slope. Infrastructure construction began in 2013 on the Alpine West satellite development, a 15- to 33-well extension of the Alpine field. Drilling at Alpine West commenced in 2015, with four out of seven producing wells coming online during the fourth quarter of 2015 at a combined rate of 20MBbls/d.
The Greater Mooses Tooth 1 (GMT1) project was sanctioned in November2015 and will become the next satellite development west of the Alpine field. First production at GMT1 is expected in 2018.
10 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements International Overview Anadarkos international operations include oil, natural-gas, and NGLs production and development in Algeria and Ghana, along with activities in Mozambique where the Company continues to make progress towards a final investment decision on an LNG development. The Company also has exploration acreage in Colombia, Cte dIvoire, Mozambique, New Zealand, Kenya, and other countries. International locations accounted for 11% of Anadarkos sales volumes and 20% of sales revenues during 2015 , and 10% of proved reserves at year-end 2015 . In 2016 , the Company expects to focus itsexploration and appraisal activity in Cte dIvoire and Colombia.
Algeria Anadarko is engaged in production and development operations in Algerias Sahara Desert in Blocks 404 and 208, which are governed by a Production Sharing Agreement between Anadarko, two other parties, and Sonatrach, the national oil and gas company of Algeria. The Company is responsible for 24.5% of the development and production costs for these blocks. The Company produces oil through the Hassi Berkine South and Ourhoud central processing facilities (CPF) in Block 404 and oil, condensate, and NGLs through the El Merk CPF in Block208. Gross production through these facilities averaged more than 368MBbls/d in 2015 , and the cumulative gross production from all three facilities reached a significant milestone, surpassing 2.0 billion BOE in July2015. The Company drilled sevendevelopment wells in 2015 .
Ghana Anadarkos production and development activities in Ghana are located offshore in the West Cape Three Points Block and the Deepwater Tano Block.
The Jubilee field (27%nonoperated unit interest), which spans both the West Cape Three Points Block and the Deepwater Tano Block, averaged gross production of 103MBbls/d of oil in 2015 . Natural-gas exports commenced in the fourth quarter of 2014, and in 2015, an average of 66MMcf/d was exported from the Jubilee field to an onshore gas processing plant in satisfaction of a commitment established in conjunction with the Jubilee development plan. In 2015, development continued with the J-24 well completed as an oil producer; the J-37 well drilled, completed, and put on production; and the J-36 well drilled with completion planned for 2016. Following the appraisal work completed in 2014, the Mahogany and Teak fields were declared commercial in March2015, and a full-field development plan for the Greater Jubilee Area was submitted to the government of Ghana in December2015. At this time, options to further increase the oil and gas throughput capacity of the floating production, storage, and offloading vessel (FPSO) are under evaluation.
The Tweneboa/Enyenra/Ntomme (TEN) project (19% nonoperated working interest) is located in the Deepwater Tano Block. Significant progress was made during 2015, including completing mechanical work on the FPSO, drilling the eleventh well, and completing four of the wells in preparation for first oil. The TEN project will use an 80-MBbls/d-capacity FPSO for production from subsea wells. The project, which commenced in 2013, was more than 80% complete at year-end 2015 and remains on budget and on schedule for first production in the third quarter of2016.
Mozambique Anadarko operates Offshore Area 1 (26.5% working interest), which totals approximately 1.2million gross acres. The Company is progressing three elements that will position the project for execution and deliver future value: the legal and contractual framework to develop LNG in Mozambique; project finance; and long-term LNG sales contracts.
Development During the first half of 2015, the Company successfully executed a six-well drilling campaign in the Golfinho-Atum field. Following this campaign, an independent third party completed a resource certification for sufficient volumes from Golfinho-Atum to support the initial development of two LNG trains. Anadarko continues to work with the construction and installation contractors for opportunities to reduce execution risk once the project progresses to the construction phase. Anadarko and its partners continue to progress over eight million metric tonnes per annum of LNG offtake to long-term sales contracts. The July2015 ratification of the Decree Law that was published by the Mozambique government in 2014 was a significant milestone in the establishment of a project-wide legal and contractual framework. During the fourth quarter of 2015, Anadarko and its partners executed a Unitization and Unit Operating Agreement with Offshore Area 4 partners that covers the joint development of the straddling Prosperidade (Offshore Area 1) and Mamba (Offshore Area 4) reservoir. The agreement is subject to government approval.
11 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Exploration In Offshore Area 1, the Company completed drilling and evaluation operations at the Tubaro Tigre-2 appraisal well during the first quarter of 2015. The well successfully appraised the Tubaro Tigre discovery that was drilled in 2014.
In Onshore Rovuma (35.7% working interest), the Company completed drilling and evaluation operations at the Kifaru-1 well during the first quarter of 2015. The well did not encounter hydrocarbons and was plugged and abandoned.
Colombia Anadarko controls the exclusive rights to explore or conduct technical evaluation activities on nine blocks totaling approximately 16million gross acres. The COL1, COL2, COL6, and COL7 blocks are operated at a 100% working interest and the remaining blocks are operated at a 50% working interest.
During 2015, Anadarko spud two exploration wells. The Kronos-1 (50% working interest) discovery encountered 130 to 230net feet of natural-gas pay in the upper objective, proving the presence of a working petroleum system and validating the geologic and seismic interpretations. The well finished drilling during the third quarter of 2015 after testing a deeper objective where it encountered non-commercial hydrocarbons. Anadarko and its partner are evaluating the drilling results to determine the next steps. The Calasu-1 well (50% working interest) tested a large four-way structure located approximately 100miles north of the Companys Kronos discovery. The well finished drilling during the fourth quarter of 2015 and encountered non-commercial quantities of pay.
Cte dIvoire Anadarko owns an operated working interest in four offshore blocks totaling approximately 1.0 million gross acres, including CI-103 with a 65% working interest and CI-527, CI-528, and CI-529, each with a 90% working interest. During the third quarter of 2015, Anadarko acquired the CI-527 block, which is contiguous with the CI-103 block to the northwest and the CI-528 block to the south. Planning is underway for a two-well exploration program on the CI-527 and CI-528 blocks in 2016.
A drilling and interference testing program began during the first quarter of 2016 as part of the continued appraisal of the Paon discovery (CI-103). The program will also include additional appraisal drilling. The data from these operations are expected to provide insight on reservoir connectivity, deliverability, fluid properties, and reservoir size.
New Zealand Anadarko controls the exclusive rights to explore or conduct technical evaluation activities on fourblocks totaling approximately 42million gross acres, of which 6.1million gross acres are owned under exploration licenses. Anadarko owns an operated 45% working interest in the Canterbury basin block and an operated 100%working interest in two Pegasus basin blocks. In the 36million acre New Caledonia basin block, Anadarko has a 25%nonoperated working interest. During 2015, the Company acquired a 3D seismic survey in the Canterbury basin and is currently evaluating potential future explorationopportunities.

Other Anadarko holds exploration interests in approximately 300,000gross acres in two offshore blocks located in the Campos basin of Brazil. Anadarko also has exploration opportunities in other overseas, new-venture areas, including Tunisia and South Africa.
12 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Proved Reserves Estimates of proved reserves volumes owned at year end, net of third-party royalty interests, are presented in billions of cubic feet (Bcf) at a pressure base of 14.73 pounds per square inch for natural gas and in millions of barrels (MMBbls) for oil, condensate, and NGLs. Total volumes are presented in millions of barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE). For this computation, one barrel is the equivalent of 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas. Shrinkage associated with NGLs has been deducted from the natural-gas reserves volumes. Proved reserves are estimated based on the average beginning-of-month prices during the 12-month period for the respective year.
Disclosures by geographic area include the United States and International. For 2015, the International geographic area consisted of proved reserves located in Algeria and Ghana, which by country and in total represented less than 15% of the Companys total proved reserves. The Company sold its Chinese subsidiary in 2014.

13 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Changes to the Companys proved reserves during 2015 are summarized in the table below: MMBOE 2015 2014 2013 Proved Reserves January 1 2,858 2,792 2,560 Reserves additions and revisions Discoveries and extensions 29 63 145 Infill-drilling additions (1) 89 577 410 Drilling-related reserves additions and revisions 118 640 555 Other non-price-related revisions (1) 289 (137 ) (40 ) Net organic reserves additions 407 503 515 Acquisition of proved reserves in place 1  36 Price-related revisions (1) (624 ) (1 ) (23 ) Total reserves additions and revisions (216 ) 502 528 Sales in place (279 ) (124 ) (12 ) Production (306 ) (312 ) (284 ) December 31 2,057 2,858 2,792 Proved Developed Reserves January 1 1,969 2,003 1,883 December 31 1,632 1,969 2,003 _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) Combined and reported as revisions of prior estimates in the Companys Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities ( Supplemental Information) under Item8 of this Form 10-K. Reserves related to infill-drilling additions are treated as positive revisions. Price-related revisions reflect the impact of current prices on the reserves balance at the beginning of 2015. Other non-price-related revisions are primarily a reflection of performance improvements coupled with the benefit of reduced year-end costs.
Proved reserves are estimated based on the average beginning-of-month prices during the 12-month period for the respective year.The average prices used to compute proved reserves at December 31, 2015, were $50.28per barrel (Bbl) for oil, $2.59 per million British thermal units for gas, and $19.47 per Bbl for NGLs.Prices for oil, natural gas, and NGLs can fluctuate widely. If commodity prices remain below the average prices used to estimate 2015 proved reserves, the Company would expect additional negative price-related reserves revisions in 2016, which could be significant.
The Companys estimates of proved developed reserves, proved undeveloped reserves (PUDs), and total proved reserves at December31,2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , and changes in proved reserves during the last threeyears are presented in the Supplemental Information under Item8 of this Form 10-K. Also presented in the Supplemental Information are the Companys estimates of future net cash flows and discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves. See Critical Accounting Estimates under Item7 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the Companys proved reserves.
The Company has not yet filed information with a federal authority or agency with respect to its estimated total proved reserves at December31,2015 . Annually, Anadarko reports gross proved reserves for U.S.-operated properties to the U.S. Department of Energy. These reported reserves are derived from the same database used to estimate and report proved reserves in this Form 10-K.
14 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Changes in PUDs Changes to PUDs during 2015 are summarized in the table below. Revisions of prior estimates reflect Anadarkos ongoing evaluation of its asset portfolio and include updates to prior PUDs, the addition of new PUDs associated with current development plans, the transfer of PUDs to unproved categories due to development plan changes, and the impact of changes in economic conditions, including changes in commodity prices. The Companys year-end development plans and associated PUDs are consistent with SEC guidelines for PUD development within fiveyears unless specific circumstances warrant a longer development time horizon.
MMBOE PUDs at January1, 2015 889 Revisions of prior estimates (199 ) Extensions, discoveries, and other additions 12 Conversions to developed (236 ) Sales (41 ) PUDs at December31, 2015 425 Revisions In 2015 , PUD reserves were revised downward by 199 MMBOE. Negative revisions of 419 MMBOE were due to the decline in commodity prices and include a reduction to NGLs reserves of 22 MMBOE associated with price-induced ethane rejection. The negative price-related revisions were partially offset by a net increase of 220MMBOE driven by increases from improved economics associated with performance improvements coupled with reduced year-end costs, increases from successful infill drilling mainly in the Wattenberg area of the Rockies, and decreases primarily associated with updates to development plans to align with the current economic environment.
Extensions, Discoveries, and Other Additions During 2015 , Anadarko added 12MMBOE of PUDs through the extension of proved acreage, primarily as a result of successful drilling in the Wolfcamp shale play in the Southern and Appalachia Region.
Conversions In 2015 , the Company converted 236MMBOE of PUD reserves to developed status, equating to 36% of total year-end 2014 PUDs when adjusted for revisions and sales. Approximately 81% of PUD conversions occurred in U.S. onshore assets, 17% occurred in Gulf of Mexico assets, and the remaining 2% occurredin international assets.
In 2015 , onshore development activity in the U.S. resulted in the conversion of 126 MMBOE in the Rockies, 61MMBOE in the Southern and Appalachia Region, and 5MMBOE in Alaska. An additional 40 MMBOE were converted in various Gulf of Mexico fields. The remaining PUD conversions in 2015 were associated with ongoing development of international assets.
Anadarko spent $2.4 billion to develop PUDs in 2015 , of which approximately 75% related to U.S. onshore assets, 13% related to international assets, and 12% related to Gulf of Mexico assets.
Sales In 2015 , PUD reserves decreased by 41MMBOE due to asset sales, primarily associated with the Companys divestiture activities in the Rockies.
Development Plans The Company annually reviews all PUDs to ensure an appropriate plan for development exists. Typically, U.S. onshore PUDs are converted to developed reserves within five years of the initial proved reserves booking, but projects associated with arctic development, deepwater development, and international programs may take longer.
At December31,2015 , the Company had 10MMBOE of pre- 2011 PUDs that remained undeveloped. Approximately two-thirds of these PUDs are associated with Gulf of Mexico opportunities that have been drilled and are scheduled for completion in 2016. The remaining pre- 2011 PUDs are associated with the El Merk development project and are being developed according to an Algerian government-approved plan. Anadarko and its partners achieved initial oil production in 2013, and the El Merk facility reached maximum allowable oil production rates in 2014 when all of the fields were brought online and the facility became fully operational.
15 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Technologies Used in Proved Reserves Estimation The Companys 2015 proved reserves additions were based on estimates generated through the integration of relevant geological, engineering, and production data, using technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results as defined in the SEC regulations. Data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface through wellbores such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and performance information. The data used also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements such as seismic data. The tools used to interpret the data included proprietary and commercially available seismic processing software and commercially available reservoir modeling and simulation software. Reservoir parameters from analogous reservoirs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates when available. The method or combination of methods used to estimate the reserves of each reservoir was based on the unique circumstances of each reservoir and the dataset available at the time of the estimate.
Internal Controls over Reserves Estimation Anadarkos estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows were made solely by the Companys engineers and are the responsibility of management. The Company requires that reserves estimates be made by qualified reserves estimators (QREs) as defined by the Society of Petroleum Engineers standards. The QREs are assigned to specific assets within the Companys regions. The QREs interact with engineering, land, and geoscience personnel to obtain the necessary data for projecting future production, net cash flows, and ultimate recoverable reserves. Management within each region approves the QREs reserves estimates. All QREs receive ongoing education on the fundamentals of SEC definitions and reserves reporting through the Companys reserves manual and internal training programs administered by the Corporate Reserves Group (CRG).
The CRG ensures confidence in the Companys reserves estimates by maintaining internal policies for estimating and recording reserves in compliance with applicable SEC definitions and guidance. Compliance with the SEC reserves guidelines is the primary responsibility of Anadarkos CRG.
The CRG is managed through the Companys finance department, which is separate from its operating regions, and is responsible for overseeing internal reserves reviews and approving the Companys reserves estimates. The DirectorReserves Administration and the Corporate Reserves Manager manage the CRG and report to the VPCorporate Planning. The VPCorporate Planning reports to the Companys Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, who in turn reports to the Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. The Governance and Risk Committee of the Companys Board meets with management, members of the CRG, and the Companys independent petroleum consultants, Miller and Lents, Ltd. (M&L), to discuss the results of procedures and methods reviews as discussed below as well as other matters and policies related to reserves.
The Companys principal engineer, who is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of proved reserves estimates, has over 29 years of experience in the oil and gas industry, including over 15years as either a reserves estimator or manager. His further professional qualifications include a degree in petroleum engineering, extensive internal and external reserves training, and asset evaluation and management. The principal engineer is a member of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and the Society of Petroleum Engineers, where he has been a member for over 29years. In addition, he is an active participant in industry reserves seminars and professional industry groups.
Third-Party Procedures and Methods Reviews M&L reviewed the procedures and methods used by Anadarkos staff in preparing the Companys estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows at December31,2015 . The purpose of the review was to determine if the procedures and methods used by Anadarko to estimate its proved reserves are effective and in accordance with the definitions contained in SEC regulations. The procedures and methods reviews by M&L were limited reviews of Anadarkos procedures and methods and do not constitute a complete review, audit, independent estimate, or confirmation of the reasonableness of Anadarkos estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows.
The reviews covered 14fields that included major assets in the United States and Africa and encompassed approximately 86% of the Companys estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows at December31,2015 . In each review, Anadarkos technical staff presented M&L with an overview of the data, methods, and assumptions used in estimating its reserves. The data presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, well performance data, operating procedures, and relevant economic criteria.
16 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Managements intent in retaining M&L to review its procedures and methods is to provide objective third-party input on the Companys procedures and methods and to gather industry information applicable to reserves estimation and reporting processes.

Through ownership and operation of these facilities, the Company improves its ability to manage costs, controls the timing of bringing on new production, and enhances the value received for gathering, processing, treating, and transporting the Companys production. Anadarkos midstream business also provides services to third-party customers, including major and independent producers. Anadarko generates revenues from its midstream activities through a variety of contract structures, including fixed-fee, percent-of-proceeds, and keep-whole agreements. Anadarkos midstream activities include WES, a publicly traded consolidated subsidiary and limited partnership that acquires, owns, develops, and operates midstream assets. Western Gas Equity Partners, LP (WGP), a publicly traded consolidated subsidiary, is a limited partnership that owns interests in WES. At December31,2015 , Anadarkos ownership interest in WGPconsisted of an 87.3% limited partner interest and the entirenon-economic general partner interest. At December31,2015 , WGPs ownership interest in WES consisted of a 34.6% limited partner interest, the entire 1.8% general partner interest, and all of the WES incentive distribution rights. At December31,2015 , Anadarko also owned an 8.5% limited partner interest in WES through other subsidiaries.
At the end of 2015 , Anadarko had 40 gathering systems and 54 processing and treating plants located throughout major onshore producing basins in Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Texas. In 2015 , the Companys midstream activity was concentrated in liquids-rich growth areas such as Wattenberg, the Delaware basin, and the Eagleford shale, as well as in the Marcellus shale dry-gas play. In 2016, the Company expects its midstream investment to focus on the Delaware basin to build infrastructure for future Wolfcamp development.
20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Wattenberg The Company placed into service a second 300-MMcf/d train at its Lancaster cryogenic processing plant. The plant supports increasing production from horizontal drilling in the Niobrara development, helping to relieve processing constraints and improve recoveries of NGLs in the basin. Three new compressor stations were placed online in 2015, which increased compression capacity by 180MMcf/d. In addition, the Company neared completion of its COSF and will commission the facility in early 2016. The COSF, capable of handling 125MBbls/d, will increase oil recoveries, enhance efficiencies of tank batteries, lower operating expenses, and further reduce impacts on theenvironment. Construction of the Saddlehorn pipeline, in which Anadarko has a 20% equity ownership, began in 2015. In November2015, Saddlehorn Pipeline Company, LLC combined with Grand Mesa to form a single pipeline project, which enhances economics by reducing capital requirements. The combined pipeline, with an initial capacity of 340MBbls/d, is planned to deliver various grades of oil from the DJ basin to storage facilities in Cushing, Oklahoma and is expected to be operational by mid-2016. Saddlehorn Pipeline Company, LLC will own an initial 190MBbls/d of capacity with sole expansion rights. Also, the Company elected to participate in an expansion of the White Cliffs oil pipeline to increase the total capacity from 152MBbls/d to approximately 215MBbls/d. The expansion will be executed in stages throughout the first half of 2016. Management believes that Anadarko is well-positioned with its oil and NGLs transportation capacity, which includes transport by pipeline, rail, and truck.
Delaware Basin In 2015, the Company expanded its midstream infrastructure for BoneSpring, Wolfcamp, and Avalon production in the Delaware basin of West Texas, installing a total of 177miles of oil and gas gathering lines. Three central production facility expansions were completed in early 2015 that added 30MBbls/d of capacity. In addition, four new central gathering facilities (CGFs) were installed and two existing CGFs were expanded to add a total of 110MMcf/d of compression capacity. Additional CGFs within the field are planned for 2016. In 2014, the Company entered into a joint-venture agreement with a third-party operator to construct the Mi Vida plant, a 200-MMcf/d cryogenic plant located in Loving County,Texas. The Mi Vida plant came online in May2015 and is processing in excess of 200MMcf/d.
In November2014, WES acquired Nuevo Midstream, LLC (Nuevo). Following the acquisition, WES changed the name of Nuevo to Delaware Basin Midstream, LLC (DBM). The DBM assets acquired by WES continue to be upgraded and enhanced to meet the producer gathering and processing needs in the region. The assets include a 300-MMcf/d cryogenic gas-processing plant. In December 2015, there was an initial fire and secondary explosion at the processing facility within the DBM complex. There were no serious injuries and the majority of damage from the incident was to the liquid-handling facilities and the amine-treating units at the inlet of the complex. Train II (with capacity of 100MMcf/d) sustained the most damage of the processing trains and is expected to be returned to service by the end of 2016. Train III (with capacity of 200 MMcf/d) experienced minimal damage and is expected to be able to accept limited deliveries of gas by the end of the first quarter of 2016, and it is expected to return to full service by the end of the second quarter of 2016, along with new liquid-handling and amine-treating facilities. There was no damage to Trains IV andV (each with a capacity of 200MMcf/d), which were under construction at the time of the incident. Train IV is expected to come online during the first half of 2016 and Train V is expected to come online during the second half of 2016. WES has a property damage insurance policy designed to cover costs to repair or rebuild damaged assets (less a minimal deductible), and business interruption insurance designed to cover lost earnings after January2,2016. Insurance claims are in process under both of these policies.
Greater Natural Buttes The Chipeta plants total processing capacity (cryogenic and refrigeration) is approximately 1Bcf/d with cryogenic processing capacity of 550MMcf/d. Chipetas third-party pipeline interconnect has added over 100MMcf/d of natural-gas supply to the plant. In 2015, the Company continued to implement optimization projects to improve reliability and efficiency.
Eagleford In the Eagleford shale, Anadarko continued the expansion of its infield gathering system with the completion of approximately 20miles of gathering pipelines and laterals that connected 16 newcentral production facilities. The 200-MMcf/d operated Brasada natural-gas cryogenic processing plant continued steady operations at capacity.
21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements East Texas/North Louisiana In East Texas, the Company continued to expand its midstream infrastructure for Cotton Valley Taylor and Haynesville production in 2015. The high-pressure Haynesville gathering system and related water and condensate infrastructure were expanded in the Carthage area to handle the continued growth associated with the Haynesville natural-gas production. Additionally, Anadarko retained access to 420MMcf/d of firm-processing capacity for the Companys current and future development in East Texas.
Marcellus In the Marcellus shale, Anadarko continued to expand its gathering system in Lycoming and Bradford Counties in Pennsylvania. In 2015, the Company connected 2 Anadarko-operated wells and 25 nonoperated wells and constructed 42miles of new pipeline.The Company commissioned three compressor stations in Lycoming County, which allowed an incremental 127MMcf/d of low-pressure gathering.

In marketing its production, the Company attempts to minimize market-related shut-ins, maximize realized prices, and manage credit-risk exposure. The Companys sales of oil, condensate, natural gas, and NGLs are generally made at market prices at the time of sale. The Company also purchases oil, condensate, natural gas, and NGLs from third parties, primarily near Anadarkos production areas, to aggregate volumes so the Company is positioned to fully use its transportation, storage, and fractionation capacity; facilitate efforts to maximize prices received; and minimize balancing issues with customers and pipelines during operational disruptions.
The Company sells its products under a variety of contract structures, including indexed, fixed-price, and cost-escalation-based agreements. The Company also engages in limited trading activities for the purpose of generating profits from exposure to changes in market prices of oil, condensate, natural gas, and NGLs. The Company does not engage in market-making practices and limits its marketing activities to oil, natural-gas, NGLs, and LNG commodity contracts. The Companys marketing-risk position is typically a net short position (reflecting agreements to sell oil, natural gas, and NGLs in the future for specific prices) that is offset by the Companys natural long position as a producer (reflecting ownership of underlying oil and natural-gas reserves). See Commodity-Price Risk under Item7A of this Form 10-K.
Oil, Condensate, and NGLs Anadarkos oil, condensate, and NGLs revenues are derived from production in the United States, Algeria, and Ghana. Most of the Companys U.S. oil, condensate, and NGLs production is sold under contracts with prices based on market indices, adjusted for location, quality, and transportation. Product from Algeria is sold by tanker as Saharan Blend, condensate, refrigerated propane, and refrigerated butane to customers primarily in the Mediterranean area. Saharan Blend is high-quality crude that provides refiners large quantities of premium products such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Oil from Ghana is sold by tanker as Jubilee Oil to customers around the world. Jubilee Oilis high-quality crude that provides refiners large quantities of premium products such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel.
22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Natural Gas Anadarko markets its natural-gas production to maximize value and to reduce the inherent risks of physical commodity markets. Anadarkos marketing segment offers supply-assurance and limited risk-management services at competitive prices as well as other services that are tailored to its customers needs. The Company may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer. The Company controls natural-gas firm-transportation capacity that ensures access to downstream markets, which enables the Company to maximize its natural-gas production. This transportation capacity also provides the opportunity to capture incremental value when price differentials between physical locations exist. The Company stores natural gas in contracted storage facilities to minimize operational disruptions to its ongoing operations and to take advantage of seasonal price differentials. Normally, the Company will have forward contracts in place (physical delivery or financial derivative instruments) to sell stored natural gas at a fixed price.
COMPETITION The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisition of reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production. The Companys competitors include national oil companies, major integrated oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, individual producers, gas marketers, and major pipeline companies as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers.

EMPLOYEES The Company had approximately 5,800 employees at December31,2015 .
REGULATORYAND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations Anadarkos business operations are subject to numerous international, provincial, federal, regional, state, tribal, local, and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. The more significant of these existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations include the following U.S. laws and regulations, as amended from time to time:  the U.S. Clean Air Act, which restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources, imposes various pre-construction, monitoring, and reporting requirements, which the Environmental Protection Agency has relied upon as authority for adopting climate change regulatory initiatives  the U.S. Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the federal Clean Water Act (CWA), which regulates discharges of pollutants from facilities to state and federal waters and establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and rulemaking as protected waters of the United States  the U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), which subjects owners and operators of vessels, onshore facilities, and pipelines, as well as lessees or permittees of areas in which offshore facilities are located, to liability for removal costs and damages arising from an oil spill in waters of the United States  U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and natural-gas operations in U.S. waters and impose obligations for establishing financial assurances for decommissioning activities, liabilities for pollution cleanup costs resulting from operations, and potential liabilities for pollution damages  the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, which imposes liability on generators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which governs the generation, treatment, storage, transport, and disposal of solid wastes, including hazardous wastes  the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act, which ensures the quality of the nations public drinking water through adoption of drinking water standards and controlling the injection of waste fluids into below-ground formations that may adversely affect drinking water sources  the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, which requires facilities to implement a safety hazard communication program and disseminate information to employees, local emergency planning committees, and response departments on toxic chemical uses and inventories  the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act, which establishes workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances, and appropriate control measures  the Endangered Species Act, which restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered and threatened species or their habitats through the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal, or permanent ban in affected areas  the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to impact the environment and that may require the preparation of environmental assessments and more detailed environmental impact statements that may be made available for public review and comment These U.S. laws and regulations, as well as state counterparts, generally restrict the level of pollutants emitted to ambient air, discharges to surface water, and disposals or other releases to surface and below-ground soils and ground water. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of delays in the permitting, development or expansion of projects; and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of the Companys activities in a particular area.
See Risk Factors under Item1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on hydraulic fracturing; proposed well control rule for the Outer Continental Shelf; ozone standards; climate change, including methane or other greenhouse gas emissions; and other regulations relating to environmental protection. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards and water quality standards, continue to evolve.
Many states where the Company operates also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing many of these same types of activities. In addition, many foreign countries where the Company is conducting business also have, or may be developing, regulatory initiatives or analogous controls that regulate Anadarkos environmental-related activities. While the legal requirements imposed under state or foreign law may be similar in form to U.S. laws and regulations, in some cases the actual implementation of these requirements may impose additional, or more stringent, conditions or controls that can significantly alter or delay the permitting, development or expansion of a project or substantially increase the cost of doing business. In addition, environmental laws and regulations, including new or amended legal requirements that may arise in the future to address potential environmental concerns such as air and water impacts, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on the Companys operations.
The Company has reviewed its potential responsibilities under both OPA and CWA as they relate to the Deepwater Horizon events. In December2010, the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the United States, filed a civil lawsuit in the Louisiana District Court against several parties, including the Company, seeking an assessment of civil penalties under the CWA in an amount to be determined by the U.S. District Court in New Orleans, Louisiana (Louisiana District Court). After previously finding that Anadarko, as a nonoperating investor in the Macondo well, was not culpable with respect to the Deepwater Horizon events, the Louisiana District Court found Anadarko liable for civil penalties under the CWA as a working-interest owner in the Macondo well and entered a judgment of $159.5million in December2015. For additional information regarding the Companys potential responsibilities under OPA, the CWA, or other legal requirements, see Note15Contingencies Deepwater Horizon Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company has incurred and will continue to incur operating and capital expenditures, some of which may be material, to comply with environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Although the Company is not fully insured against all environmental and occupational health and safety risks, and the Companys insurance does not cover any penalties or fines that may be issued by a governmental authority, it maintains insurance coverage that it believes is sufficient based on the Companys assessment of insurable risks and consistent with insurance coverage held by other similarly situated industry participants. Nevertheless, it is possible that other developments, such as stricter and more comprehensive environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations as well as claims for damages to property or persons resulting from the Companys operations, could result in substantial costs and liabilities, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, to Anadarko.
The Company believes that it is in material compliance with existing environmental and occupational health and safety regulations. Further, the Company believes that the cost of maintaining compliance with these existing laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, but new or more stringently applied existing laws and regulations could increase the cost of doing business, and such increases could be material.
Oil Spill-Response Plan Domestically, the Company is subject to compliance with the federal Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) regulations, which, among other standards, require every owner or operator of a U.S. offshore lease to prepare and submit for approval an oil spill-response plan prior to conducting any offshore operations. The submitted plan is required to provide a detailed description of actions to be taken in the event of a spill; identify contracted spill-response equipment, materials, and trained personnel; and stipulate the time necessary to deploy identified resources in the event of a spill. The BSEE regulations may be amended, resulting in more stringent requirements as changes to the amount and type of spill-response resources to which an owner or operator must maintain ready access. Accordingly, resources available to the Company may change to satisfy any new regulatory requirements or to adapt to changes in the Companys operations.
Anadarko has in place and maintains both Regional (Central and Western Gulf of Mexico) and Sub-Regional (Eastern Gulf of Mexico) Oil Spill-Response Plans (Plans) for the Companys Gulf of Mexico operations. The Plans set forth procedures for a rapid and effective response to spill events that may occur as a result of Anadarkos operations. The Plans are reviewed by the Company at least annually and updated as necessary. Drills are conducted by the Company at least annually to test the effectiveness of the Plans and include the participation of spill-response contractors, representatives of Clean Gulf Associates (CGA, a not-for-profit association of production and pipeline companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico contractually engaged by the Company for such matters), and representatives of relevant governmental agencies. The Plans and any revisions to the Plans must be approved by the BSEE.
As part of the Companys oil spill-response preparedness, and as set forth in the Plans, Anadarko maintains membership in CGA and has an employee representative on the executive committee of CGA. CGA was created to provide a means of effectively staging response equipment and to provide effective spill-response capability for its member companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico. CGA equipment includes, among other things, skimming vessels, barges, boom, and dispersants. CGA has executed a support contract with T&T Marine to coordinate bareboat charters and to provide for expanded response support. T&T Marine is responsible for inspecting, maintaining, storing, and staging CGA equipment. T&T Marine has positioned CGAs equipment and materials in a ready state at various staging areas around the Gulf of Mexico. T&T Marine has service contracts in place with domestic environmental contractors as well as with other companies that provide for support services during the execution of spill-response activities.
Anadarko is also a member of the Marine Preservation Association, which provides full access to the Marine Spill Response Corporation (MSRC) cooperative. In the event of a spill, MSRC stands ready to mobilize all of its equipment and materials. MSRC has a fleet of dedicated Responder Class Oil Spill-Response Vessels (OSRVs), designed and built to recover spilled oil.
MSRC has equipment housed for the Atlantic Region, the Gulf of Mexico Region, the California Region, and the Pacific Northwest Region. Their equipment includes, among other things, skimmers, OSRVs, fast response vessels, barges, storage bladders, work boats, ocean boom, and dispersant.
25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company has also entered into a contractual commitment to access subsea intervention, containment, capture, and shut-in capacity for deepwater exploration wells. Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC) is open to oil and gas operators in the Gulf of Mexico and provides members access to oil spill-response equipment and services on a per-well fee basis. Anadarko has an employee representative on the executive committee of MWCC, and this employee currently serves as its Chair. MWCC members have access to a containment system that is planned for use in deepwaterdepths of up to 10,000 feet with containment capacity of 100 MBbls/d of liquids and flare capability for 200MMcf/d of natural gas.
Anadarko retains geospatial and satellite imagery services through the MDA Corporation (MDA) to provide coverage over the Companys Gulf of Mexico operations. MDA owns and maintains two radar satellites, which provide all-weather surveillance and imagery available to assist in identifying areas of concern on the surface waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The Company has agreements with Waste Management, Inc. and Clean Harbors to assist in the proper disposal of contaminated and hazardous waste soil and debris. In addition, Anadarko has agreements with HDR Engineering, Inc. for assistance with subsea dispersant applications. The Company also has agreements with TDI-Brooks International for its scientific research vessels to properly monitor the effectiveness of the dispersant application and the health of the ecosystem. The Company also has agreements with Scientific and Environmental Associates, Inc. (SEA) for assistance with surface dispersant applications. SEA is a scientific support consulting firm providing expertise in surface-dispersion applications and efficacy monitoring.
Anadarko has emergency and oil spill-response plans in place for each of its exploration and operational activities around the globe. Each plan is intended to satisfy the requirements of relevant local or national authorities, describes the actions the Company is expected to take in the event of an incident, includes drills conducted by the Company at least annually, and includes reference to external resources that may become necessary in the event of an incident. Included in these external resources is the Companys contract with Oil Spill Response Limited (OSRL), a global emergency and oil spill-response organization headquartered in London.
OSRL has an aircraft available for dispersant application or equipment transport. OSRL also has a number of active recovery boom systems and a range of booms that can be used for offshore, nearshore, or shoreline responses. In addition, OSRL provides, among other things, a range of communications equipment, safety equipment, transfer pumps, dispersant application systems, temporary storage equipment, power packs and generators, small inflatable vessels, rigid inflatable boats, work boats, and fast response vessels. OSRL also has a wide range of oiled wildlife equipment in conjunction with the SeaAlarmFoundation.
In addition to Anadarkos membership in or access to CGA, MSRC, OSRL, and MWCC, the Company participates in industry-wide task forces, which are currently studying improvements in both gaining access to and controlling blowouts in subsea environments. Two such task forces are the Subsea Well Control and Containment Task Force and the Oil Spill Task Force.
TITLE TO PROPERTIES As is customary in the oil and gas industry, a preliminary title review is conducted at the time properties believed to be suitable for drilling operations are acquired by the Company. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations, thorough title examinations of the drill site tracts are conducted by third-party attorneys, and curative work is performed with respect to significant defects, if any, before proceeding with operations. Anadarko believes the title to its leasehold properties is good, defensible, and customary with practices in the oil and gas industry, subject to such exceptions that, in the opinion of legal counsel for the Company, do not materially detract from the use of such properties.
Leasehold properties owned by the Company are subject to royalty, overriding royalty, and other outstanding interests customary in the industry. The properties may be subject to burdens such as liens incident to operating agreements, current taxes, development obligations under oil and gas leases and other encumbrances, easements, and restrictions. Anadarko does not believe any of these burdens will materially interfere with its use of these properties.

28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Item 1A.Risk Factors CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms Anadarko and Company refer to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Company has made in this Form 10-K, and may from time to time make in other public filings, press releases, and management discussions, forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, concerning the Companys operations, economic performance, and financial condition. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, information concerning future production and reserves, schedules, plans, timing of development, contributions from oil and gas properties, marketing and midstream activities, and also include those statements preceded by, followed by, or that otherwise include the words may, could, believes, expects, anticipates, intends, estimates, projects, target, goal, plans, objective, should, would, will, potential, continue, forecast, future, likely, outlook, or similar expressions or variations on such expressions. For such statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will be realized. Anadarko undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
These forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainties. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Companys expectations include, but are not limited to, the following risks and uncertainties:  the Companys assumptions about energy markets  production and sales volume levels  levels of oil, natural-gas, and natural-gas liquids (NGLs) reserves  operating results  competitive conditions  technology  availability of capital resources, levels of capital expenditures, and other contractual obligations  supply and demand for, the price of, and the commercialization and transporting of oil, natural gas, NGLs, and other products or services  volatility in the commodity-futures market  weather  inflation  availability of goods and services, including unexpected changes in costs  drilling risks  processing volumes and pipeline throughput  general economic conditions, nationally, internationally, or in the jurisdictions in which the Company is, or in the future may be, doing business  the Companys inability to timely obtain or maintain permits or other governmental approvals, including those necessary for drilling and/or development projects  legislative or regulatory changes, including changes relating to hydraulic fracturing; retroactive royalty or production tax regimes; deepwater drilling and permitting regulations; derivatives reform; changes in state, federal, and foreign income taxes; environmental regulation; environmental risks; and liability under federal, state, foreign, and local environmental laws and regulations 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  the ability of BP Exploration& Production Inc.

Prices for oil, natural gas, and NGLs can fluctuate widely. For example, New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) West Texas Intermediate oil prices have been volatile and ranged from a high of $107.26per barrel in June2014 to a low of $26.21per barrel in February 2016. Also, NYMEX Henry Hub natural-gas prices have been volatile and ranged from a high of $6.15per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in February2014 to a low of $1.76per MMBtu in December 2015. The duration and magnitude of the decline in oil and natural-gas prices cannot be predicted. Our revenues, operating results, cash flows from operations, capital budget, and future growth rates are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our oil, natural gas, and NGLs. The markets for oil, natural gas, and NGLs have been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile in the future. Factors influencing the prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:  the domestic and worldwide supply of, and demand for, oil, natural gas, and NGLs  volatility and trading patterns in the commodity-futures markets  the cost of exploring for, developing, producing, transporting, and marketing oil, natural gas, and NGLs  the level of global oil and natural-gas inventories  weather conditions  the level of U.S. exports of oil, condensate, liquefied natural gas, or NGLs  the ability of the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producing nations to agree to and maintain production levels  the worldwide military and political environment, civil and political unrest in Africa and the Middle East, uncertainty or instability resulting from the escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities, or acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere  the effect of worldwide energy conservation and environmental protection efforts 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  the price and availability of alternative and competing fuels  the level of foreign imports of oil, natural gas, and NGLs  domestic and foreign governmental laws, regulations, and taxes  the proximity to, and capacity of, natural-gas pipelines and other transportation facilities  general economic conditions worldwide The long-term effect of these and other factors on the prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs is uncertain. Prolonged or further declines in these commodity prices may have the following effects on our business:  adversely affecting our financial condition, liquidity, ability to finance planned capital expenditures, and results of operations  reducing the amount of oil, natural gas, and NGLs that we can produce economically  causing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects  reducing our revenues, operating income, or cash flows  reducing the amounts of our estimated proved oil, natural-gas, and NGLs reserves  reducing the carrying value of our oil, natural-gas, and midstream properties due to recognizing additional impairments of proved properties, unproved properties, exploration assets, and midstream facilities  reducing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil, natural-gas, and NGLsreserves  limiting our access to, or increasing the cost of, sources of capital such as equity and long-term debt 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.
As of December31,2015 , our long-term debt was rated BBB with a stable outlook by both Standard and Poors (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and our commercial paper program was rated A-2 by S&P and F2 by Fitch. Our long-term debt was rated Baa2 with a stable outlook and our commercial paper program was rated P2 by Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) until December 16, 2015, when Moodys announced that it had placed both ratings under review for downgrade along with the ratings of 28 other U.S. exploration and production companies and their related subsidiaries.
In February 2016, S&P affirmed our BBB rating and changed the outlook from stable to negative. As of the time of filing this Form 10-K, neither Fitch nor Moodys had announced any change to our credit ratings; however, we cannot be assured that our credit ratings will not be downgraded. Any downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our cost of capital, and a downgrade to a level that is below investment grade could also adversely affect our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy or to raise debt in the public debt markets.
In the event of a downgrade in our credit rating to a level that is below investment grade, we may be required to post collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash as financial assurance of our performance under certain contractual arrangements such as pipeline transportation contracts and oiland gas sales contracts. At December31, 2015, there were no letters of credit or cash provided as assurance of our performance under these type of contractual arrangements with respect to credit-risk-related contingent features. If our credit ratings had been downgraded to a level below investment grade as of December31,2015 , the collateral required to be posted under these arrangements would have been $460 million . Additionally, certain of these arrangements contain financial assurances language that may, under certain circumstances, permit our counterparties to request additional collateral.
Furthermore, in the event of a downgrade to a level that is below investment grade, the credit thresholds with our derivative counterparties may be reduced or, in certain cases, eliminated, which may require the posting of additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features for which a net liability position existed on December31,2015 , was $1.3 billion , net of collateral. As of December31,2015 , $58 million was posted as cash collateral with our derivative counterparties. For additional information, see Note9Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form10-K.
32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We are subject to complex laws and regulations relating to environmental protection that can adversely affect the cost, manner, and feasibility of doing business.
Our operations and properties are subject to numerous federal, provincial, regional, state, tribal, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing the release of pollutants or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations govern the following, among other things:  issuance of permits in connection with exploration, drilling, production, and midstream activities  drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and other protected areas  types, quantities, and concentrations of emissions, discharges, and authorized releases  generation, management, and disposition of waste materials  offshore oil and natural-gas operations and decommissioning of abandoned facilities  reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites  remediation of contaminated sites  protection of endangered species These laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for our failure to comply or for any contamination resulting from our operations, including the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of delays in the permitting, development, or expansion of projects; and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in a particular area. Moreover, changes in, or reinterpretations of, environmental laws and regulations governing areas where we operate may negatively impact our operations. Examples of recent proposed and final regulations include the following:  Proposed Outer Continental Shelf Well Control Rule . In April2015, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Oil and Sulfur Operations on the Outer Continental Shelf - Blowout Preventer Systems and Well Control that focuses on well blowout preventer systems and well control with respect to operations on the Outer Continental Shelf. The proposed rule requires, among other things, incorporation of the latest industry standards establishing minimum baseline standards for the design, manufacture, repair, and maintenance of blowout preventers as well as more controls over the maintenance and repair of blowout preventers. This rulemaking is expected to be finalized in 2016.
Ground-Level Ozone Standards.
In October2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule under the Clean Air Act, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare, respectively. The final rule became effective in December2015. Certain areas of the country in compliance with the ground-level ozone NAAQS standard may be reclassified as non-attainment and such reclassification may make it more difficult to construct new or modified sources of air pollution in newly designated non-attainment areas. Moreover, states are expected to implement more stringent regulations, which could apply to our operations. Compliance with this final rule could, among other things, require installation or new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs.
Reduction of Methane Emissions by the Oil and Gas Industry.
In August2015, the EPA proposed rules that will establish emission standards for methane from certain new and modified oil and natural-gas production and natural-gas processing and transmission facilities as part of the Obama Administrations efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and natural-gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. The EPAs proposed rule package includes standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically-fractured oil and natural-gas well completions, fugitive emissions from well sites and compressors, and equipment leaks at natural-gas processing plants and pneumatic pumps. The EPA is expected to finalize these rules in 2016.
33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions.
The U.S. Congress and the EPA, in addition to some state and regional efforts, have in recent years considered legislation or regulations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, and GHG reporting and tracking programs. In the absence of federal GHG-limiting legislations, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations that, among other things, restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act and may require the installation of best available control technology to limit emissions of GHGs from any new or significantly modified facilities that we may seek to construct in the future if they would otherwise emit large volumes of GHGs together with other criteria pollutants. Also, certain of our operations are subject to EPA rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore and offshore production sources. On an international level, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that, in December 2015, agreed to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets.
These and other regulatory changes could significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs or could result in delays to or limitations on our exploration and production activities, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. For a description of certain environmental proceedings in which we are involved, see Legal Proceedings under Item 3 and Note15Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form10-K.
Changes in laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing or other oil and natural-gas operations could increase our costs of doing business, impose additional operating restrictions or delays, and adversely affect our production.
Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice used to stimulate production of oil and natural gas from dense subsurface rock formations such as shales. We routinely apply hydraulic-fracturing techniques in many of our U.S. onshore oil and natural-gas drilling and completion programs. The process involves the injection of water, sand, and additives under pressure into a targeted subsurface formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.
Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural-gas commissions. However, several federal agencies have also asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA issued Clean Air Act final regulations in 2012 and proposed additional Clean Air Act regulations in August 2015 governing performance standards for the oil and natural-gas industry; proposed in April 2015 effluent limitations guidelines that waste water from shale natural-gas extraction operations must meet before discharging to a treatment plant; and issued in 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) published a final rule in March 2015 that establishes new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands but, in September 2015, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming issued a preliminary injunction barring implementation of this rule, which order the BLM could appeal and is being separately appealed by certain environmental groups. Also, from time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In the event that a new federal level of legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic-fracturing process is adopted in areas where we operate, we may incur additional costs to comply with such federal requirements that may be significant in nature, and also could become subject to additional permitting requirements and experience added delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities.
34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Certain states in which we operate, including Colorado, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Texas, and Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, or other regulatory requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations, including subsurface water disposal. States could elect to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York in 2015. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. For example, several cities in Colorado passed temporary or permanent moratoria on hydraulic fracturing within their respective city limits in 2012 and 2013. Since that time, in response to lawsuits brought by an industry trade group, local district courts struck down the ordinances for certain of those Colorado cities in 2014, primarily on the basis that state law preempts local bans on hydraulic fracturing. A suit brought by the trade group against at least one other Colorado city, Broomfield, remains pending. The cities of Fort Collins and Longmont, among those cities whose ordinances were struck down in 2014, were notified in September 2015 by the Colorado Supreme Court that the high court had agreed to hear their appeals. Notwithstanding attempts at the local level to prohibit hydraulic fracturing, the opportunity exists for cities to adopt local ordinances allowing hydraulic fracturing activities within their jurisdictions while regulating the time, place, and manner of those activities.
In addition, certain interest groups in Colorado opposed to oil and natural-gas development generally, and hydraulic fracturing in particular, have from time to time advanced various ballot initiatives aimed at significantly limiting or preventing oil and natural-gas development. In response to one such set of initiatives, the Governor of Colorado created the Task Force on State and Local Regulation of Oil and Gas Operations (Task Force) in September 2014 to make recommendations to the state legislature regarding the responsible development of Colorados oil and natural-gas resources. In February 2015, the Task Force made several non-binding recommendations to the Colorado Governor, and recently, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) undertook a rulemaking process to implement those recommendations. It is possible that the COGCC could undertake additional rulemaking procedures or the Colorado state legislature could introduce and seek to adopt additional legislation relating to oil and natural-gas operations that could limit or prevent oil and natural-gas development. In addition, several ballot initiatives have been proposed for inclusion on the Colorado state ballot in November 2016. Although it is early in the political process, if approved, these initiatives, or others that may be proposed, could give local governments in Colorado greater authority to limit hydraulic fracturing, require greater distances between certain well sites and occupied structures, or otherwise limit the production and development of oil and natural gas.
In the event that ballot initiatives, local or state restrictions, or prohibitions are adopted and result in more stringent limitations on the production and development of oil and natural gas in areas where we conduct operations, including the Wattenberg field in Colorado, we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may experience delays or curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities. In addition, we could possibly be limited or precluded in the drilling of wells or in the amounts that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves. Such compliance costs and delays, curtailments, limitations, or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
In addition to asserting regulatory authority, a number of federal entities are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. In April 2012, President Obama issued an executive order that established a working group for the purpose of coordinating policy, information sharing, and planning among federal agencies and offices regarding unconventional natural-gas production, including hydraulic fracturing. In June 2015, the EPA released its draft report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, which concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities have not lead to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water sources in the United States, although there are above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water sources. However, in January 2016, the EPAs Science Advisory Board provided its comments on the draft study, indicating its concern that the EPAs conclusion of no widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water sources arising from fracturing activities did not reflect the uncertainties and data limitations associated with such impacts, as described in the body of the draft report. The final version of this EPA report remains pending and is expected to be completed in 2016. Such EPA final report, when issued, as well as other studies and initiatives or any future studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur efforts to further regulate hydraulic fracturing.
35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We may be subject to claims and liabilities relating to the Deepwater Horizon events that result in losses, notwithstanding BPs indemnification against such losses, as a result of BPs inability to satisfy its indemnification obligations under the Settlement Agreement and BPCNAs and BP p.l.c.s inability to satisfy their guarantees of BPs indemnification obligations.
In October 2011, we and BP entered into a settlement agreement, mutual releases, and agreement to indemnify relating to the Deepwater Horizon events (Settlement Agreement). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, we are fully indemnified by BP against all claims, causes of action, losses, costs, expenses, liabilities, damages, or judgments of any kind arising out of the Deepwater Horizon events, related damage claims arising under OPA, NRD claims and assessment costs, and any claims arising under the OA. This indemnification is guaranteed by BPCNA and, in the event that the net worth of BPCNA declines below an agreed-on amount, BP p.l.c. has agreed to become the sole guarantor. We are not indemnified against penalties and fines, punitive damages, shareholder derivative or securities laws claims, or certain other claims.
In July 2015, BP announced a settlement agreement in principle with the Department of Justice and certain states and local government entities regarding essentially all of the outstanding claims against BP related to the Deepwater Horizon event (BP Settlement) and, in October 2015, lodged a proposed consent decree with the Louisiana District Court. Essentially all claims and liabilities relating to the Deepwater Horizon events that are covered by BPs indemnification obligations under our Settlement Agreement will be resolved as part of the BP Settlement, provided that the consent decree is ultimately approved by the Louisiana District Court. A hearing related to the consent decree is currently scheduled for March 2016. In the event the consent decree is not approved by the Louisiana District Court, any failure or inability on the part of BP to satisfy its indemnification obligations under the Settlement Agreement, or on the part of BPCNA or BP p.l.c. to satisfy their respective guarantee obligations, could subject us to significant monetary liability beyond the terms of the Settlement Agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Furthermore, in certain instances we may be required to recognize a liability for amounts for which we are indemnified in advance of or in connection with recognizing a receivable from BP for the related indemnity payment. Any such liability recognition without collection of the offsetting receivable could adversely impact our results of operations, our financial condition, and our ability to make borrowings. For additional information, see Note15Contingencies  Deepwater Horizon Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Our debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility.
Our total debt was $15.8billion at December31,2015 . We also have various commitments for leases, drilling contracts, derivative contracts, firm transportation, and purchase obligations for services and products. Our financial commitments could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to, the following:  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures, to engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or to otherwise fully realize the value of our assets and opportunities because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt or to comply with any restrictive terms of our debt  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and/or fewer financial commitments Additionally, the credit agreements governing our $3.0 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our $2.0 billion 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility contain a number of customary covenants, including a financial covenant requiring maintenance of a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 65% (excluding the effect of non-cash write-downs), and limitations on certain secured indebtedness, sale-and-leaseback transactions, and mergers and other fundamental changes. Our ability to meet such covenants may be affected by events beyond our control.
36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our proved reserves are estimates. Any material inaccuracies in our reserves estimates or assumptions underlying our reserves estimates could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many factors beyond our control that could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated. The reserves information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K represents estimates prepared by our internal engineers. The procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants; however, no reserves audit was conducted by these consultants. Estimation of reserves is not an exact science. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural-gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, any of which may cause actual results to vary considerably from these estimates. These factors and assumptions may include, but are not limited to, the following:  historical production from an area compared with production from similar producing areas  assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and court rulings  assumptions concerning future oil and natural-gas prices, future operating costs, and capital expenditures  estimates of future severance and excise taxes, workover costs, and remedial costs Estimates of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of expected future net cash flows prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues, and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and the variance may be material. The discounted cash flows included in this Form 10-K should not be construed as the fair value of the estimated oil, natural-gas, and NGLs reserves attributable to our properties. The estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on the average beginning-of-month prices during the 12-month period for the respective year. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from the SEC regulation-compliant prices used for purposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves. Therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease.
Failure to replace reserves may negatively affect our business.
Our future success depends on our ability to find, develop, or acquire additional oil and natural-gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Our proved reserves generally decline when reserves are produced, unless we conduct successful exploration or development activities, acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. We may be unable to find, develop, or acquire additional reserves on an economic basis. Furthermore, if oil and natural-gas prices increase, our costs for finding or acquiring additional reserves could also increase.
Our domestic operations are subject to governmental risks that may impact our operations.
Our domestic operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and are subject to complex federal, provincial, regional, state, tribal, local, and other laws and regulations such as restrictionson production, permitting, changes in taxes, deductions, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering-rate controls, and hydraulic fracturing and environmental protection regulations. To conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals, and certificates from various federal, provincial, regional, state, tribal, and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. Our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws, including environmental and tax laws and regulations, are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations such as the adoption of government-payment-transparency regulations. For example, from time to time, deficit reduction or tax reform legislation has been proposed that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows .
Proposals have included provisions that would, if enacted, (i)eliminate the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs, (ii)eliminate the manufacturing deduction for oil and gas qualified production activities, (iii)eliminate accelerated depreciation for tangible property, and (iv) treat publicly traded partnerships for fossil fuels as C corporations.
37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Future economic, business, or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.
During the last few years, concerns over inflation, potential default on U.S. debt, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, and uncertainties with regard to European sovereign debt, have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. Concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. Continued concerns could cause demand for petroleum products to diminish or stagnate, which could impact the price at which we can sell our oil, natural gas, and NGLs and impede the execution of long-term sales agreements or prices thereunder which are the basis for future LNG production; affect the ability of our vendors, suppliers, and customers to continue operations; and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.
Our results of operations could be adversely affected by goodwill impairments.
As a result of mergers and acquisitions, we had approximately $5.4 billion of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December31,2015 . Goodwill must be tested at least annually for impairment, and more frequently when circumstances indicate likely impairment. Goodwill is considered impaired to the extent that its carrying amount exceeds its implied fair value. Various factors could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit such as our inability to replace the value of our depleting asset base, difficulty or potential delays in obtaining drilling permits, or other adverse events such as lower oil and natural-gas prices, which could lead to an impairment of goodwill. An impairment of goodwill could have a substantial negative effect on our profitability.
We are vulnerable to risks associated with our offshore operations that could negatively impact our operations and financial results.
We conduct offshore operations in the Gulf of Mexico, Ghana, Mozambique, Colombia, Cte dIvoire, New Zealand, Kenya, and other countries. Our operations and financial results could be significantly impacted by conditions in some of these areas because we are vulnerable to certain unique risks associated with operating offshore, including those relating to the following:  hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions  oilfield service costs and availability  compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations  terrorist attacks such as piracy  remediation and other costs and regulatory changes resulting from oil spills or releases of hazardous materials  failure of equipment or facilities In addition, we conduct some of our exploration in deep waters (greater than 1,000feet) where operations and decommissioning activities are more difficult and costly than in shallower waters. The deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as international deepwater locations, lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. As a result, deepwater operations may require significant time between a discovery and the time that we can market our production, thereby increasing the risk involved with these operations.
38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Additional domestic and international deepwater drilling laws, regulations, and other restrictions; delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development, oil spill-response, and decommissioning plans; and other related developments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
In response to the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the BSEE, agencies of the U.S. Department of the Interior, imposed more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters. Compliance with these more stringent rules and regulations, together with any uncertainties or inconsistencies in current decisions and rulings by governmental agencies, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits or exploration, development, oil spill-response and decommissioning plans, and possible additional regulatory initiatives could adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts. In addition, new regulatory initiatives may be adopted or enforced by the BOEM and/or the BSEE in the future that could result in additional delays, restrictions, or obligations with respect to oil and natural-gas exploration and production operations conducted offshore. For example, in September 2015, the BOEM issued draft guidance that would bolster supplemental bonding procedures for the decommissioning of offshore wells, platforms, pipelines, and other facilities. The BOEM is expected to issue the draft guidance in the form of a final Notice to Lessees and Operators by no later than early summer 2016. These existing rules, or any new rules, regulations, or legal initiatives could delay or disrupt our operations, increase the risk of expired leases due to the time required to develop new technology, result in increased supplemental bonding and costs, and limit activities in certain areas, or cause us to incur penalties, fines, or shut-in production at one or more of our facilities or result in the suspension or cancellation of leases. Also, if material spill events similar to the Deepwater Horizon incident were to occur in the future, the United States or other countries could elect to again issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, may from time to time issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and gas exploration and development. We cannot predict with any certainty the full impact of any new laws, regulations, or legal initiatives on our drilling operations or on the cost or availability of insurance to cover the risks associated with such operations. The overall costs to implement and complete any such spill response activities or any decommissioning obligations could exceed estimated accruals, insurance limits, or supplemental bonding amounts, which could result in the incurrence of additional costs to complete.
Further, the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (as well as international deepwater locations) lacks the degree of physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. Therefore, despite our oil spill-response capabilities, it may be difficult for us to quickly or effectively execute any contingency plans related to potential material events in the future.
The matters described above, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We operate in foreign countries and are subject to political, economic, and other uncertainties.
We have operations outside the United States, including in Algeria, Ghana, Mozambique, Colombia, Cte dIvoire, New Zealand, Kenya, and other countries. As a result, we face political and economic risks andother uncertainties with respect to our international operations. These risks may include the following, among other things:  loss of revenue, property, and equipment or delays in operations as a result of hazards such as expropriation, war, piracy, acts of terrorism, insurrection, civil unrest, and other political risks, including tension and confrontations among political parties  transparency issues in general and, more specifically, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption compliance laws and issues  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  unilateral renegotiation of contracts by governmental entities  redefinition of international boundaries or boundary disputes  difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies  foreign-exchange restrictions  international monetary fluctuations and changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar as compared to the currencies of other countries in which we conduct business For example, Ghana and Cte dIvoire are engaged in a dispute regarding the international maritime boundary between the two countries. As a result, Cte dIvoire claims to be entitled to the maritime area, which covers a portion of the Deepwater Tano Block where we are developing the TEN complex. In the event Cte dIvoire is successful in its maritime border claims, this development could be materially impacted. Also, Venezuela and Guyana are in a dispute regarding their maritime and land borders in which the two countries have initiated a dialogue. We are unable to ascertain the full impact of this border dispute on future operations in Guyana.
Outbreaks of civil and political unrest and acts of terrorism have occurred in countries in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, including countries close to or where we conduct operations. Continued or escalated civil and political unrest and acts of terrorism in the countries in which we operate could result in our curtailing operations.In the event that countries in which we operate experience civil or political unrest or acts of terrorism, especially in events where such unrest leads to an unseating of the established government, our operations in such countries could be materially impaired.
Our international operations may also be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by laws, policies, and regulations of the United States affecting foreign trade and taxation, including U.S. trade sanctions.
Realization of any of the factors listed above could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our commodity-price risk-management and trading activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks.
To the extent that we engage in commodity-price risk-management activities to protect our cash flows from commodity-price declines, we may be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. In addition, our commodity-price risk-management and trading activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the following occur:  our production is less than the notional volumes  a widening of price basis differentials occurs between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the derivative arrangement  the counterparties to our hedging or other price-risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements  a sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil, natural-gas, or NGLs prices The enactment of derivatives legislation, and the promulgation of regulations pursuant thereto, could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity-price, interest-rate, and other risks associated with its business.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), enacted in 2010, requires the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market, including swap clearing and trade execution requirements. While many rules and regulations have been promulgated and are already in effect, other rules and regulations, including the proposed position limits rule, remain to be finalized or effectuated, and therefore, the impact of those rules and regulations on us is uncertain at this time. Moreover, the phase-in threshold for swap dealer de minimis purposes is set to expire on December 31, 2017, (and thereby revert from $8 billion to $3billion) unless the CFTC acts to maintain or change the current $8 billion threshold before that time. The financial reform legislation may require our compliance with a lower de minimis threshold, as well as with margin, position limits, clearing, and trade-execution requirements if certain hedging exemptions are unavailable. Although we expect to qualify for exceptions to such requirements for swaps entered to hedge our commercial risks, the application of such requirements, including to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. Moreover, the framework of what qualifies as a bona fide hedge for position-limits purposes is yet uncertain.
The Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder, could (i) significantly increase the cost, or decrease the liquidity, of energy-related derivatives we use to hedge against commodity-price fluctuations (including through requirements to post collateral), (ii) materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, and (iii) reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and applicable rules and regulations, our cash flow may become more volatile and less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. In addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, those transactions may become subject to such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.
41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Deterioration in the credit or equity markets could adversely affect us.
We have exposure to different counterparties. For example, we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, investment funds, and other institutions. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty. Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. We have exposure to these financial institutions through our derivative transactions. In addition, if any lender under our credit facilities is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lenders commitment under our credit facilities. Moreover, to the extent that purchasers of our production rely on access to the credit or equity markets to fund their operations, there is a risk that those purchasers could default in their contractual obligations to us if such purchasers were unable to access the credit or equity markets for an extended period of time.
We are not insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.
Our business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production, gathering, processing, and transportation of oil and natural gas, including blowouts; cratering and fire; environmental hazards such as natural-gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and vessel ruptures, and releases of chemicals or otherhazardous substances, any of which could result in damage to, or destruction of, oil and natural-gas wells or formations, production facilities, and other property; pollution or other environmental damage; and injury to persons. For protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage, including insurance coverage for certain physical damage, blowout/loss of control of a well, comprehensive general liability, aviation liability, and workers compensation and employers liability. However, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover us against 100% of potential losses arising as a result of the foregoing and for certain risks, such as political risk, business interruption, war, terrorism, and piracy, for which we have limited or no coverage. In addition, we are not insured against all risks in all aspects of our business such as hurricanes. The occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the completion of and commencement of production from development projects.
We are involved in several large development projects and the completion of those projects may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion dates. Key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of such projects include the following:  project approvals by joint-venture partners  timely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies or legislative and other governmental approvals  weather conditions  availability of qualified personnel  civil and political environment of, and existing infrastructure in, the country or region in which the project is located  manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment  commercial arrangements for pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons Delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the forward-looking statements related to large development projects and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The oil and gas exploration and production industry is very competitive, and some of our exploration and production competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do.
The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production. Our competitors include national oil companies, major integrated oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, individual producers, gas marketers, and major pipeline companies as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers. Some of our competitors may have greater and more diverse resources on which to draw than we do. If we are not successful in our competition for oil and gas reserves or in our marketing of production, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
The high cost or unavailability of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, and other oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
Our industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs of rigs, equipment, supplies, and personnel are substantially greater and their availability to us may be limited. Additionally, these services may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The high cost or unavailability of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, and other oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
Our drilling activities may not be productive.
Drilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural-gas reservoirs. Drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including the following:  unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  fires, explosions, blowouts, and surface cratering  marine risks such as capsizing, collisions, and hurricanes  difficulty identifying and retaining qualified personnel  title problems  other adverse weather conditions  shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment Certain of our future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. While all drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Because of the percentage of our capital budget devoted to high-risk exploratory projects, it is likely that we will continue to experience significant exploration and dry hole expenses.
43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We have limited influence over the activities on properties we do not operate.
Other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest. We have limited ability to influence the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties or the amount or timing of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them. Our dependence on the operator and other working-interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital, lead to unexpected future costs, or adversely affect the timing of activities.
Our ability to sell our oil, natural-gas, and NGLs production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation.
The marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline facilities and tanker transportation. If any pipelines or tankers become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport the oil, natural gas, and NGLs, which could increase our costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of the oil and gas.
Our business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.
As an oil and gas producer, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats such as attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or those of third parties such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. Our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities, and infrastructure may result in increased costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
While we have experienced cybersecurity attacks, we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. In addition, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate or remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control of Anadarko, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders.
Our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that may make a change of control of Anadarko difficult, even if it may be beneficial to our stockholders, including provisions governing the nomination and removal of directors, the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent and regulation of stockholders ability to bring matters for action before annual stockholder meetings, and the authorization given to our Board of Directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock.
In addition, Section203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.
44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We may reduce or cease to pay dividends on our common stock.
We can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at the current rate or at all. In response to the current commodity-price environment, the Company decreased the quarterly dividend from $0.27 per share to $0.05 per share in February 2016. The amount of cash dividends, if any, to be paid in the future is determined by our Board of Directors based on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, levels of capital and exploration expenditures, future business prospects, expected liquidity needs, and other matters that our Board of Directors deems relevant.
The loss of key members of our management team, or difficulty attracting and retaining experienced technical personnel, could reduce our competitiveness and prospects for future success.
The successful implementation of our strategies and handling of other issues integral to our future success will depend, in part, on our experienced management team. The loss of key members of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business. We do not carry key man insurance. Our exploratory drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced explorationists, engineers, and other professionals. Competition for such professionals could be intense. If we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.

Item 3.Legal Proceedings The Company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits and is involved in governmental proceedings and regulatory controls arising in the ordinary course of business, including personal injury and death claims; title disputes; tax disputes; royalty claims; contract claims; contamination claims relating to oil and gas exploration, development, production, transportation, and processing; and environmental claims, including claims involving assets owned by acquired companies and claims involving assets previously sold to third parties and no longer a part of the Companys current operations. Anadarko is also subject to various environmental-remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state, tribal, and local laws and regulations. While the ultimate outcome and impact on the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, after consideration of recorded expense and liability accruals, management believes that the resolution of pending proceedingswill not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or cashflows.
WGR Operating, LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is currently in negotiations with the EPA with respect to alleged noncompliance with the leak detection and repair requirements of the Clean Air Act at its Granger, Wyoming facilities. Although management cannot predict the outcome of settlement discussions, it is likely a resolution of this matter will result in a fine or penalty in excess of $100,000.

Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms Anadarko and Company refer to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Index Page Mission and Strategy 50 Outlook 51 Overview 53 Financial Results 55 Liquidity and Capital Resources 69 Critical Accounting Estimates 77 Recent Accounting Developments 80 MISSION AND STRATEGY Anadarkos mission is to deliver a competitive and sustainable rate of return to shareholders by developing, acquiring, and exploring for oil and natural-gas resources vital to the worlds health and welfare. Anadarko employs the following strategy to achieve this mission:  explore in high-potential, proven basins  identify and commercialize resources  employ a global business development approach  ensure financial discipline and flexibility Exploring in high-potential, proven basins worldwide provides the Company with growth opportunities. Anadarkos exploration success has created value by increasing future resource potential while providing the flexibility to mitigate risk by monetizing discoveries.
Developing a portfolio of primarily unconventional resources provides the Company a stable base of capital-efficient and predictable development opportunities that, in turn, position the Company for consistent growth at competitive rates.
Anadarkos global business development approach transfers core skills across the globe to assist in the discovery and development of world-class resources that are accretive to the Companys performance. These resources help form an optimized global portfolio where both surface and subsurface risks are actively managed.
A strong balance sheet is essential for the development of the Companys assets, and Anadarko is committed to disciplined investment in its businesses to efficiently manage commodity-price cycles. Maintaining financial discipline enables the Company to capitalize on the opportunities afforded by its global portfolio while allowing the Company to pursue new strategic growth opportunities.
50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements OUTLOOK During 2015, the oil and natural-gas industry experienced a significant decrease in commodity prices driven by a global supply/demand imbalance for oil and an oversupply of natural gas in the United States. The decline in commodity prices and global economic conditions have continued into 2016 and low commodity prices may exist for an extended period. The Companys revenues, operating results, cash flows from operations, capital spending, and future growth rates are highly dependent on the global commodity-price markets, which affect the value the Company receives from its sales of oil, natural-gas, and natural-gas liquids (NGLs) production. The Companys strategy in 2015 was to preserve and build value by focusing a greater percentage of its capital investment on longer-dated projects while driving cost savings and efficiencies through every aspect of its business. During 2015, the Company closed $2.0billion of monetizations and was successful in lowering its capital expenditures by 36% and its operating expenses by 13% compared to 2014 while maintaining relatively flat production year over year.
The Company plans to continue its disciplined and focused approach in 2016 by emphasizing value over growth, enhancing operational efficiencies, reducing capital expenses, and managing its diverse asset portfolio. Management has recommended to the Board of Directors (Board) a 2016 capital budget of approximately $2.8billion, which excludes the capital budget of Western Gas Partners, LP (WES), a publicly traded consolidated subsidiary. The $2.8billion budget is nearly 50% lower than the Companys capital investments in 2015 and almost 70% lower than 2014.
The Company will continue to evaluate the oil and natural-gas price environments and may adjust its capital spending plans to maintain the appropriate liquidity and financial flexibility. Anadarko expects that its capital expenditures will be aligned with its cash flows from operations and targeted asset monetizations.
Liquidity As of December 31, 2015, Anadarko had $939 million of cash on hand plus $4.75 billion of borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facilities ($5.0billion capacity, less $250million of outstanding commercial paper notes). Substantially all of Anadarkos cash balances at December 31, 2015, were domiciled in the United States and were available to support its worldwide operations. In addition, future excess cash flows generated from the Companys international assets are available to support both its U.S. operations and corporate needs without incurring incremental U.S. income tax. In December 2015, Anadarko extended the maturity of its $3.0billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (Five-Year Facility) to January 2021, and in January 2016, Anadarko replaced its $2.0 billion 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility (364-Day Facility) with a new $2.0 billion 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility that will mature in January 2017. The extension and renewal included no changes to covenants or pricing, and the original bank-group fully participated.
Anadarkos $1.750 billion 5.950% Senior Notes, scheduled to mature in September 2016, were classified as long-term debt on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015, as Anadarko intends to refinance these obligations prior to or at maturity with new long-term debt issuances or by using the Five-Year Facility.
As of December 31, 2015, Anadarkos long-term debt was rated BBB with a stable outlook by both Standard and Poors (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and its commercial paper program was rated A-2 by S&P and F2 by Fitch. Anadarkos long-term debt was rated Baa2 with a stable outlook and its commercial paper program was rated P2 by Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) until December16,2015, when Moodys announced that it had placed both ratings under review for downgrade along with the ratings of 28 other U.S. exploration and production companies and their related subsidiaries. In February 2016, S&P affirmed Anadarkos BBB rating and changed the outlook from stable to negative. As of the time of filing this Form 10-K, neither Fitch nor Moodys had announced any change to Anadarkos credit ratings; however, the Company cannot be assured that its credit ratings will not be downgraded. Any downgrade in Anadarkos credit ratings could negatively impact its cost of capital, and a downgrade to a level that is below investment grade could also adversely affect the Companys ability to effectively execute aspects of its strategy or to raise debt in the public debt markets.
51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In the event of a downgrade in Anadarkos credit rating to a level that is below investment grade, the Company may be required to post collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash as financial assurance of its performance under certain contractual arrangements such as pipeline transportation contracts and oiland gas sales contracts. At December31, 2015, there were no letters of credit or cash provided as assurance of the Companys performance under these types of contractual arrangements with respect to credit-risk-related contingent features. If Anadarkos credit ratings had been downgraded to a level below investment grade as of December31,2015 , the collateral required to be posted under these arrangements would have been $460 million . Additionally, certain of these arrangements contain financial assurances language that may, under certain circumstances, permit the counterparties to request additional collateral. For additional information, see Risk Factors in Item1A of this Form 10-K.
Furthermore, in the event of a downgrade in Anadarkos credit rating to a level that is below investment grade, the credit thresholds with Anadarkos derivative counterparties may be reduced or, in certain cases, eliminated, which may require the Company to post additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features for which a net liability position existed on December31,2015, was $1.3 billion, net of collateral. As of December31,2015, $58 million was posted as cash collateral with Anadarkos derivative counterparties. For additional information, see Note9Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
Anadarko believes that its cash on hand, anticipated operating cash flows, and proceeds from expected asset monetizations will be sufficient to fund the Companys projected 2016 operational and capital programs. In response to the current commodity-price environment, the Board decreased the quarterly dividend from $0.27 per share to $0.05per share in February2016. On an annualized basis, the dividend decrease will have the effect of providing approximately $450million of additional cash available to enhance the Companys operations and financial flexibility. Anadarko also expects to receive an $881million tax refund in 2016 related to the income tax benefit associated with the Companys 2015 tax net operating loss carryback. Further, Anadarko enters into strategic derivative positions to reduce commodity-price risk and increase the predictability of cash flows. At December31,2015, derivative positions covered approximately 26% of Anadarkos anticipated oil sales volumes, 3% of its anticipated NGLs sales volumes, and 2% of its anticipated natural-gas sales volumes for 2016. These instruments had a fair value of $273million as of December31,2015. See Note9Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K. Anadarko believes that the actions taken to enhance the Companys liquidity position coupled with its asset portfolio and operating and financial performance provide the necessary financial flexibility to fund the Companys current and long-term operations.
Potential for Future Impairments During 2015, the Company recognized significant impairments of proved oil and gas and midstream properties and impairments of unproved oil and gas properties, primarily as a result of lower forecasted commodity prices and changes to the Companys drilling plans. At December31,2015, the Companys estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to a certain depletion group with a net book value of approximately $2.2billion indicated that the carrying amount was expected to be recovered; however, this depletion group may be at risk for impairment if the estimates of future cash flows decline. The Company estimates that, if this depletion group becomes impaired in a future period, the Company could recognize non-cash impairments in that period in excess of $800million. It is also reasonably possible that prolonged low or further declines in commodity prices, further changes to the Companys drilling plans in response to lower prices, or increases in drilling or operating costs could result in other additional impairments.
Anadarko had approximately $5.4billion of goodwill at December31,2015, allocated to the following reporting units: $4.9billion to oil and gas exploration and production, $383 million to WES gathering and processing, $5million to WES transportation, and $62 million to other gathering and processing. Goodwill is tested annually in October, and at interim periods when necessary. Although commodity prices declined during the year, as of December31,2015, the estimated fair value of the oil and gas reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by more than 15%, without consideration for any control premium, and the other reporting units were not at risk of impairment. However, it is reasonably possible that prolonged low or further declines in commodity prices, decreases in proved reserves, changes in exploration or development plans, significant property impairments, increases in operating or drilling costs, significant changes in regulations, or other negative changes to the economic environment in which Anadarko operates could result in a further reduction in the fair value of the reporting units and increase the potential for a future impairment of goodwill.
52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Proved Reserves Proved reserves are estimated based on the average beginning-of-month prices during the 12-month period for the respective year.The average prices used to compute proved reserves at December 31, 2015, were $50.28per barrel (Bbl) for oil, $2.59 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) for gas, and $19.47 per Bbl for NGLs.Prices for oil, natural gas, and NGLs can fluctuate widely. For example, New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) West Texas Intermediate oil prices have been volatile and ranged from a high of $107.26per barrel in June2014 to a low of $26.21per Bbl in February 2016. Also, NYMEX Henry Hub natural-gas prices have been volatile and ranged from a high of $6.15per MMBtu in February2014 to a low of $1.76per MMBtu in December 2015. If commodity prices remain below the average prices used to estimate 2015 proved reserves, the Company would expect additional negative price-related reserves revisions in 2016, which could be significant.
OVERVIEW Significant 2015 operating and financial activities include the following: Total Company  Anadarkos sales volumes averaged 836 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d), which was relatively flat compared to 2014 and includes a 37MBOE/d decrease related to divestitures.

The Company continuously monitors its liquidity needs, coordinates its capital expenditure program with its expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule, and evaluates available funding alternatives in light of current and expected conditions. The Company has a variety of funding sources available, including cash on hand, an asset portfolio that provides ongoing cash-flow-generating capacity, opportunities for liquidity enhancement through divestitures and joint-venture arrangements that reduce future capital expenditures, and the Companys credit facilities and commercial paper program. In addition, an effective registration statement is available to Anadarko covering the sale of WGP common units owned by the Company.
Operating Activities One of the primary sources of variability in the Companys cash flows from operating activities is the fluctuation in commodity prices, the impact of which Anadarko partially mitigates by entering into commodity derivatives. Sales volume changes also impact cash flow, but historically have not been as volatile as commodity prices. Anadarkos cash flows from operating activities are also impacted by the costs related to continued operations and debt service.
Anadarkos cash flow used in operating activities in 2015 was $1.9billion , compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of $8.5billion in 2014 and $8.9billion in 2013 . The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to the $5.2billion Tronox settlement payment, decreased sales revenues primarily resulting from lower commodity prices, and a net decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Cash flows from operating activities for 2014 decreased due to $730million of cash received in 2013 associated with the Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement, a $520million income tax payment in 2014 associated with the Companys divestiture of a 10% working interest in Offshore Area 1 in Mozambique, lower average oil and NGLs prices, lower natural-gas volumes, higher operating expenses, and the unfavorable impact of changes in working capital items. These decreases were substantially offset by higher average natural-gas prices, higher sales volumes for oil and NGLs, and net cash received in settlement of commodity derivative instruments.
Tronox Settlement Payment In April 2014,Anadarko and Kerr-McGee entered into a settlement agreement to resolve all claims asserted in the Tronox Adversary Proceeding for $5.15billion. In addition, the Company agreed to pay interest on that amount from April3,2014, through payment of the settlement, with an annual interest rate of 1.5% for the first 180days and 1.5% plus the one-month LIBOR thereafter. In January 2015, the Company paid $5.2billion after the settlement agreement became effective using cash on hand and borrowings. See Note15Contingencies Tronox Litigation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form10-K.
Pension and Other Postretirement Contributions Contributions to the pension and other postretirement plans were $58million in 2015, $136million in 2014, and $174million in 2013. The Company expects to contribute $46million in 2016 to its pension and other postretirement plans.

During 2015 , cash from operations and property divestitures were the primary sources for funding capital investments. The Companys capital expenditures decreased by 36% for the year ended December31,2015 , primarily due to reduced development and exploration activity, which resulted in decreased development costs of $2.1billion primarily in the Rockies and the Southern and Appalachia Region; lower exploration costs of $710million primarily in the Southern and Appalachia Region and the Gulf of Mexico; and lower gathering, processing, and other costs of $498million primarily due to lower expenditures for plants and gathering in the Rockies. Development acquisitions in 2014 included a spar lease buyout of $110million in the Gulf of Mexico. These decreases were partially offset by the 2015 acquisition of certain oil and gas properties in the Delaware basin for $79million.
The Companys capital expenditures increased by 9% for the year ended December31,2014, due to increased development costs primarily in the Wattenberg field of $663million and in the Eagleford shale of $546million and a spar lease buyout of $110million in the Gulf ofMexico. The increase in the Eagleford shale was primarily due to the 2013 development drilling being funded by a third party as a result of a carried-interest agreement that was fully funded in June 2013. These 2014 increases were partially offset by 2013 acquisitions of certain oil and gas properties and related assets in the Moxa area of Wyoming for $310million, primarily representing the fair value of the oil and gas properties acquired, and the acquisition of a 33.75% interest in gas-gathering systems located in the Marcellus shale in north-central Pennsylvania from a third party by WES for $135million.
Carried-Interest Arrangements In 2014, the Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement that requires a third party to fund $442million of Anadarkos capital costs in exchange for a 34% working interest in the Eaglebine development, located in Southeast Texas. The third-party funding is expected to cover Anadarkos future capital costs in the development through 2020. At December31,2015 , $111million of the $442million carry obligation had been funded.
In 2013, the Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement that requires a third party to fund $860million of Anadarkos capital costs in exchange for a 12.75% working interest in the Heidelberg development, located in the Gulf of Mexico. At December31,2015 , $793million of the $860million carry obligation had been funded.
Acquisitions of Businesses In November2014, WES acquired Nuevo Midstream, LLC (Nuevo), which owns and operates gathering and processing assets located in the Delaware basin in West Texas, for $1.557billion, including $30million of cash acquired. Following the acquisition, WES changed the name of Nuevo to Delaware Basin Midstream, LLC. See Note3Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Assets Held for Sale in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form10-K.
Divestitures Anadarko received pretax sales proceeds related to property divestiture transactions of $1.4billion in 2015 , $5.0billion in 2014 , and $567million in 2013 . See Note3Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Assets Held for Sale in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form10-K.

In 2013, net proceeds from the WES 2.600% Senior Notes were used to repay WES RCF borrowings.
Revolving Credit Facilities In June2014, Anadarko entered into a $3.0billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility ( Five -Year Facility) and a $2.0billion 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility ( 364 -Day Facility).

For additional information on the Companys revolving credit facilities, such as years of maturity, interest rates, and covenants, see Note11Debt and Interest Expense in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
Commercial Paper Program In January 2015, the Company initiated a commercial paper program, which allows a maximum of $3.0billion of unsecured commercial paper notes and is supported by the Companys Five-Year Facility. The maturities of the commercial paper notes vary, but may not exceed 397 days. The commercial paper notes aresold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are issued either at a discounted price to their principalface value or will bear interest at varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. Such discounted price or interest amounts are dependent on market conditions and the ratings assigned to the commercial paper program by credit rating agencies at the time of issuance of the commercial paper notes. During 2015, the Company had net borrowings of $250million, which remained outstanding at December31,2015 , at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.98%. During 2015 , maximum outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program were $1.4 billion and the average borrowings outstanding were $773million with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.57%. See Note11Debt and Interest Expense in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Debt Maturities At December31,2015 , Anadarkos scheduled debt maturities during 2016 consisted of $1.750billion 5.950% Senior Notes scheduled to mature in September, $250million of borrowings under the commercial paper program, and $33million related to the senior amortizing notes associated with the TEUs. Anadarkos Zero-Coupon Senior Notes due 2036 (Zero Coupons) can be put to the Company in October of each year, in whole or in part, for the then-accreted value, which will be $839million at the next put date in October2016.
The Company classified the 5.950% Senior Notes, the Zero Coupons, and the outstanding commercial paper notes as long-term debt on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015, as Anadarko intends to refinance these obligations prior to or at maturity with new long-term debt issuances or by using the Five-Year Facility.
Anadarko may from time to time seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt or equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Companys liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.
At December31, 2015, Anadarkos scheduled 2017 debt maturities were $2.0billion.

During 2015, Anadarko repaid $16 million of senior amortizing notes associated with theTEUs.
72 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Derivative Instruments The Companys derivative instruments are subject to individually negotiated credit provisions that may require the Company or the counterparties to provide collateral of cash or letters of credit depending on the derivative portfolio valuation versus negotiated credit thresholds. These credit thresholds may also require full or partial collateralization or immediate settlement of the Companys obligations if certain credit-risk-related provisions are triggered such as if the Companys credit rating from major credit rating agencies declines to a level that is below investment grade. Derivative settlements and collateralization are classified as cash flows from operating activities unless the derivatives contain an other-than-insignificant financing element, in which case the settlements and collateralization are classified as cash flows from financing activities. As of December 31, 2015, the Company provided cash collateral of $58million on its interest-rate derivatives with an other-than-insignificant financing element. For additional information, see Note9Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.

During2013, WES issued approximately 12million common units to the public, including the $125million continuous offering program. These offerings raised net proceedsof $ 725million , which were primarily used to repay outstanding RCF borrowings and for other general partnership purposes, including funding of WESs capital expenditures.
Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest Owners WES distributed to its unitholders other than Anadarko and WGP an aggregate of $231million in 2015 , $175million in 2014 , and $130million in 2013 . WES has made quarterly distributions to its unitholders since its initial public offering (IPO) in the second quarter of 2008 and has increased its distribution from $0.30 per common unit for the third quarter of 2008 to $0.80per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2015 (paid in February 2016 ).
WGP distributed to its unitholders other than Anadarko an aggregate of $37million during 2015 , $24million in 2014 , and $12million in 2013 . WGP has made quarterly distributions to its unitholders since its IPO in December 2012 and has increased its distribution from $0.17875 per common unit for the first quarter of 2013 to $0.40375 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2015 (to be paid in February 2016 ).
73 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Insurance Coverage and Other Indemnities Anadarko maintains property and casualty insurance that includes coverage for physical damage to the Companys properties, blowout/control of a well, restoration and redrill, sudden and accidental pollution, third-party liability, workers compensation and employers liability, and other risks. Anadarkos insurance coverage includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, the Companys insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the Company against liability or loss from all potential consequences and damages.
The Companys current insurance coverage includes (a) $400million per occurrence from Oil Insurance Limited (OIL) for physical damage to Anadarkos properties on a replacement cost basis, blowout/control of well, restoration and redrill, and sudden and accidental pollution; (b) $700million per occurrence from the commercial markets for the items described in item (a) above, which is in excess of the OIL coverage and which follows the form of OIL coverage with certain exceptions; (c)$400million from the commercial markets, which scales to Anadarkos working interest, for third-party liabilities, including sudden and accidental pollution and aviation liability; and (d) $275million for aircraft liability (in addition to the third-party liability limits described in item (c) above). Anadarko does not carry significant coverage for loss of production income from any of the Companys facilities or for any losses that result from the effects of a named windstorm.
The Companys service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify Anadarko for injuries and death to employees of the service provider and subcontractors hired by the service provider as well as for propertydamage suffered by the service provider and its contractors. Also, these service agreements generally indemnify Anadarko for pollution originating from the equipment of any contractors or subcontractors hired by the service provider.
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements Anadarko may enter into off-balance-sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance-sheet obligations. The Companys material off-balance-sheet arrangements and transactions include operating lease arrangements and undrawn letters of credit. In addition, the Company enters into other contractual agreements in the normal course of business for processing, treating, transportation, and storage of oil, natural gas, and NGLs as well as for other oil and gas activities as discussed below in Obligations . Other than the items discussed above, there are no other transactions, arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect Anadarkos liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources.
74 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Obligations The following is a summary of the Companys obligations at December31,2015 : Obligations by Period (1) millions 2016 2017-2018 2019-2020 2021 and beyond Total Total debt Principaltotal borrowings at face value (2) $ 2,033 $ 2,516 $ 1,200 $ 11,563 $ 17,312 Principalcapital lease obligation   1 19 20 Investee entities debt (3)    2,853 2,853 Interest on borrowings 932 1,500 1,161 7,460 11,053 Interest on capital lease obligations 2 3 4 13 22 Investee entities interest (3) 50 144 173 2,351 2,718 Operating leases Drilling rig commitments 739 834 215  1,788 Production platforms 21 43 50 23 137 Other 46 79 49 18 192 Oil and gas activities 741 886 276 314 2,217 Asset retirement obligations 309 128 304 1,318 2,059 Midstream and marketing activities 1,114 2,137 1,996 2,612 7,859 Derivative liabilities (4) 54 419 513 500 1,486 Uncertain tax positions, interest, and penalties (5) 418 65  1,307 1,790 Environmental liabilities 24 25 32 64 145 Other  116   116 Total $ 6,483 $ 8,895 $ 5,974 $ 30,415 $ 51,767 _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) This table does not include litigation-related contingent liabilities or the Companys pension and postretirement benefit obligations. See Note15Contingencies and Note16Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits, and Defined-Contribution Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
(2) Includes the fully accreted principal amount of the Zero Coupons of approximately $2.4 billion as coming due after 2020 . While the Zero Coupons do not mature until 2036, the outstanding Zero Coupons can be put to the Company each October, in whole or in part, for the then-accreted value. The Company could be required to repurchase the outstanding Zero Coupons at $839 million in October 2016 (the next potential put date).
(3) Anadarko has legal right of setoff and intends to net-settle its obligations under each of the notes payable to the investees with the distributable value of its interest in the corresponding investee. Accordingly, the investments and the obligations are presented net on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets in other long-term liabilitiesother for all periods presented. These notes payable provide for a variable rate of interest, reset quarterly. Therefore, future interest payments presented in the table above are estimated using the forward LIBOR rate curve. Further, the above table does not reflect the preferred return that Anadarko receives on its investment in these entities, which is also LIBOR-based, but with a lower margin than the margin on the associated notes payable. See Note8Equity-Method Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
(4) Represents Anadarkos gross derivative liability after taking into account the impacts of netting margin and collateral balances deposited with counterparties. See Note9Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
(5) See Note12Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
75 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Operating Leases Operating lease obligations include approximately $1.7billion related to five offshore drilling vessels and $98 million related to certain contracts for U.S. onshore drilling rigs. Anadarko manages its access to rigs to support the execution of its drilling strategy over the next several years. Lease payments associated with the drilling of exploratory wells and development wells, net of amounts billed to partners, will initially be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties, and either depreciated or impaired in future periods or written off as exploration expense. At December31,2015 , the Company had $329million in various commitments under non-cancelable operating lease agreements for production platforms and equipment, buildings, facilities, compressors, and aircraft. For additional information, see Note14Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
Oil and Gas Activities At December31,2015 , Anadarko had various long-term contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development, and production activities that extend beyond 2015 . The Company has work-related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic data, and fulfilling rig commitments. The preceding table includes long-term drilling and work-related commitments of $2.2billion , comprised of approximately $1.5billion related to the United States and $728million related to international locations.
Asset Retirement Obligations Anadarko is obligated to fund the costs of disposing of long-lived assets upon their abandonment. The majority of Anadarkos asset retirement obligations (AROs) relate to the plugging of wells and the related abandonment of oil and gas properties. The Companys AROs are recorded at estimated fair value, measured by reference to the expected future cash outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligation discounted at the Companys credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Revisions to estimated AROs can result from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation rates, and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment.
Midstream and Marketing Activities Anadarko has entered into various processing, transportation, storage, and purchase agreements to access markets and provide flexibility to sell its oil, natural gas, and NGLs in certain areas.
Environmental Liabilities Anadarko is subject to various environmental-remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state, tribal, and local laws and regulations. At December31,2015 , the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet included a $145 million liability for remediation and reclamation obligations. The Company continually monitors the liability recorded and ongoing remediation and reclamation activities, and believes the amount recordedis appropriate. For additional information on environmental issues, see Risk Factors under Item1A of this Form 10-K.
76 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. See Note1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K for discussion of the Companys significant accounting policies. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates, and actual results may differ from these estimates. Management considers the following to be its most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment. The selection, development, and disclosure of these estimates is discussed with the Companys Audit Committee.
Proved Reserves Anadarko estimates its proved oil and gas reserves according to the definition of proved reserves provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. This definition includes oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, government regulations, etc. (at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made). Prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements, and do not include adjustments based on expected future conditions. For reserves information, see Oil and Gas Properties and Activities Proved Reserves under Items 1 and 2 of this Form 10-K and the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
The Companys estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, development plans, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions, and governmental restrictions as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date.
The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of DD&A. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on DD&A and could result in property impairments. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by five percent across all properties, DD&A in 2015 would have increased by approximately $223million.
Exploratory Costs Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploratory costs associated with a well discovering hydrocarbons are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities, in particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, analyzing whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed. Therefore, at any point in time, the Company may have capitalized costs on its Consolidated Balance Sheets associated with exploratory wells that may be charged to exploration expense in future periods.See Note6Suspended Exploratory Well Costs in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
77 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Fair Value The Company estimates fair value of long-lived assets for impairment testing, reporting units for goodwill impairment testing when necessary, assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination or exchanged in non-monetary transactions, pension plan assets, and initial measurements of AROs. When the Company is required to measure fair value and there is not a market-observable price for the asset or liability or for a similar asset or liability, the Company uses the cost, income, or market valuation approaches depending on the quality of information available to support managements assumptions. The cost approach is based on managements best estimate of the current asset replacement cost. The income approach is based on managements best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate. The market approach is based on managements best assumptions regarding prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving comparable assets. Such evaluations involve significant judgment and the results are based on expected future events or conditions such as sales prices, estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput, development and operating costs and the timing thereof, future net cash flows, economic and regulatory climates, and other factors, most of which are often outside of managements control. However, assumptions used reflect a market participants view of long-term prices, costs, and other factors, and are consistent with assumptions used in the Companys business plans and investment decisions.
Property Impairments When circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, the expected undiscounted future net cash flows of the asset group are compared to the carrying amount of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future net cash flows, based on the Companys estimate of future oil and natural-gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to fair value. Fair value estimates require significant judgment and oil and natural-gas prices are a significant component of the fair-value estimate. Prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and the Company expects that volatility to continue in the future.
A long-lived asset other than an unproved oil and gas property is evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may be greater than its undiscounted future net cash flows. Impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of an assets carrying amount over its estimated fair value. The Company uses a variety of fair-value measurement techniques as discussed above when market information for the same or similar assets does not exist.
Goodwill Impairments The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually in October (or more frequently as circumstances dictate). The Company first assesses whether an impairment of goodwill is indicated through a qualitative assessment to determine the likelihood of whether the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the related carrying amount, then goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not necessary. If the qualitative assessment indicates fair value of the reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the Company compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets, including goodwill, and determines whether impairment is necessary.
When evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company assesses relevant events and circumstances, including the following:  significant changes in the stock price of Anadarko, WES, and WGP  changes in commodity prices  changes in cost factors such as costs of drilling; production costs; and gathering, processing, and other transportation costs  impairments recognized by the Company  acquisitions and disposals of assets 78 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  changes to the Companys reserves, including changes due to fluctuations in commodity prices and updates to the Companys plans or forecasts  changes in trading multiples for midstream peers Because quoted market prices for the Companys reporting units are not available, management applies judgment in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units for purposes of performing goodwill impairment tests, when such tests are necessary. Management uses information available to make these fair-value estimates, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks associated with the assets and observable for the oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit, control premiums and market multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the gathering and processing and transportation reporting units.
In estimating the fair value of its oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit, the Company assumes production profiles used in its estimation of reserves that are disclosed in the Companys supplemental oil and gas disclosures, market prices based on the forward price curve for oil and gas at the test date (adjusted for location and quality differentials), capital and operating costs consistent with pricing and expected inflation rates, and discount rates that management believes a market participant would use based upon the risks inherent in Anadarkos operations.
Management also includes control premium assumptions based on observable market information regarding how a market participant would value the oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit as a whole rather than as individual properties that are part of an oil and gas portfolio.
The Company estimates fair value for the WES gathering and processing, WES transportation, and other gathering and processing reporting units by applying an estimated multiple to projected EBITDA. The Company considered observable transactions in the market and trading multiples for peers in determining an appropriate multiple to apply against the Companys projected EBITDA for these reporting units.
A lower fair-value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in impairment of goodwill. Factors that could trigger a lower fair-value estimate include prolonged low or further declines in commodity prices, decreases in proved reserves, changes in exploration or development plans, significant property impairments, increases in operating or drilling costs, significant changes in regulations, or other negative changes to the economic environment in which Anadarko operates.
Environmental Obligations and Other Contingencies Management makes judgments and estimates when it establishes liabilities for environmental remediation, litigation, and other contingent matters. Estimates of litigation-related liabilities are based on the facts and circumstances of the individual case and on information currently available to the Company. The extent of information available varies based on the status of the litigation and the Companys evaluation of the claim and legal arguments. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Companys estimate of litigation-related liabilities including discovery activities; briefings filed with the relevant court; rulings from the court made pre-trial, during trial, or at the conclusion of any trial; and similar cases involving other plaintiffs and defendants that may set or change legal precedent. As events unfold throughout the litigation process, the Company evaluates the available information and may consult with third-party legal counsel to determine whether liability accruals should be established or adjusted.
Estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the stage of investigation, the stage of the remedial design, evaluation of existing remediation technologies, and presently enacted laws and regulations. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Companys estimate of environmental-remediation costs such as changes in laws and regulations, changes in the interpretation or administration of laws and regulations, revisions to the remedial design, unanticipated construction problems, identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater, and changes in costs of labor, equipment, and technology. Consequently, it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures that could arise related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the Companys estimates. The Companys in-house legal counsel and environmental personnel regularly assess contingent liabilities and, in certain circumstances, consult with third-party legal counsel or consultants to assist in the evaluation of the Companys liability for these contingencies.
79 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Income Taxes The amount of income taxes recorded by the Company requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of various tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses, and tax-credit carryforwards. The Company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets by analyzing the reversal periods of available net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards, temporary differences in tax assets and liabilities, the availability of tax planning strategies, and estimates of future taxable income and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Companys internal business forecasts. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. The Company routinely assesses potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, establishes accruals for such amounts. The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities, including deferred state income tax assets and liabilities, are subject to significant judgment by management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances. Although management considers its tax accruals adequate, material changes in these accruals may occur in the future, based on the progress of ongoing tax audits, changes in legislation, and resolution of pending tax matters.
RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS See Note1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K for discussion of recent accounting developments affecting the Company.
Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys primary market risks are attributable to fluctuations in energy prices and interest rates. In addition, foreign-currency exchange-rate risk exists due to anticipated foreign-currency-denominated payments and receipts. These risks can affect revenues and cash flows, and the Companys risk-management policies provide for the use of derivative instruments to manage these risks. The types of commodity derivative instruments used by the Company include futures, swaps, options, and fixed-price physical-delivery contracts. The volume of commodity derivatives entered into by the Company is governed by risk-management policies and may vary from year to year. Both exchange and over-the-counter traded derivative instruments may be subject to margin-deposit requirements, and the Company may be required from time to time to deposit cash or provide letters of credit with exchange brokers or counterparties to satisfy these margin requirements. For additional information relating to the Companys derivative and financial instruments, see Note9Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form10-K.
COMMODITY-PRICE RISK The Companys most significant market risk relates to prices for natural gas, oil, and NGLs. Management expects energy prices to remain unpredictable and potentially volatile. As energy prices decline or rise significantly, revenues and cash flows are likewise affected. In addition, a non-cash write-down of the Companys oil and gas properties or goodwill may be required if commodity prices experience a significant decline. Below is a sensitivity analysis for the Companys commodity-price-related derivative instruments.
Derivative Instruments Held for Non-Trading Purposes The Company had derivative instruments in place to reduce the price risk associated with future production of 30MMBbls of oil, 14 Bcf of natural gas, and 1 MMBbls of NGLs at December31,2015 , with a net derivative asset position of $273 million . Based on actual derivative contractual volumes, a 10% increase in underlying commodity prices would reduce the fair value of these derivatives by $58million , while a 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices would increase the fair value of these derivatives by $44million . However, any cash received or paid to settle these derivatives would be substantially offset by the sales value of production covered by the derivative instruments.
80 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Derivative Instruments Held for Trading Purposes At December31,2015 , the Company had a net derivative asset position of $17 million on outstanding derivative instruments entered into for trading purposes. Based on actual derivative contractual volumes, a 10% increase or decrease in underlying commodity prices would not materially impact the Companys gains or losses on these derivative instruments.
For additional information regarding the Companys marketing and trading portfolio, see Marketing Activities under Items 1 and 2 of this Form 10-K.
INTEREST-RATE RISK Borrowings under each of the 364-Day Facility, the Five-Year Facility, the commercial paper program, and WESs RCF are subject to variable interest rates. The balance of Anadarkos long-term debt on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets has fixed interest rates. The Company has $2.9 billion of obligations based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) that are presented on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets net of preferred investments in two non-controlled entities. These obligations give rise to minimal net interest-rate risk because coupons on the related preferred investments are also LIBOR-based. While a 10% change in LIBOR would not materially impact the Companys interest cost, it would affect the fair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt.
At December31,2015 , the Company had a net derivative liability position of $1.5 billion related to interest-rate swaps. A 10% increase (decrease) in the three-month LIBOR interest-rate curve would increase (decrease) the aggregate fair value of outstanding interest-rate swap agreements by $103 million . However, any change in the interest-rate derivative gain or loss could be substantially offset by changes in actual borrowing costs associated with future debt issuances. For a summary of the Companys outstanding interest-rate derivative positions, see Note9Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K.
FOREIGN-CURRENCY EXCHANGE-RATE RISK Anadarkos operating revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, and the predominant portion of Anadarkos capital and operating expenditures are also U.S.-dollar-denominated. Exposure to foreign-currency risk generally arises in connection with project-specific contractual arrangements and other commitments. Near-term foreign-currency-denominated expenditures are primarily in Colombian pesos, Mozambican meticais, British pounds sterling, and Brazilian reais.
The Company also has risk related to exchange-rate changes applicable to cash held in escrow pending final determination of the Companys Brazilian tax liability for its 2008 divestiture of the Peregrino field offshore Brazil,which is currently under consideration by the Brazilian courts. See Note15Contingencies Other Litigation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8 of this Form 10-K. At December31,2015 , cash of $86million was held in escrow.
Management periodically engages in various risk-management activities to mitigate a portion of its exposure to foreign-currency exchange-raterisk. A 10% increase or decrease in the foreign-currency exchange rate would not materially impact the Companys gain or loss related to foreign currency.

The Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly the Companys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing its Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company includes amounts that are based on estimates and judgments that Management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The Companys financial statements have been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm appointed by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Management has made available to KPMG LLP all of the Companys financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of the stockholders and Directors meetings.
MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Anadarkos internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys Management and Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2015 . This assessment was based on criteria established in the Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment, we believe that as of December31,2015 , the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.
KPMG LLP has issued an attestation report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2015 .
/s/ R. A. WALKER R. A. Walker Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer /s/ ROBERT G. GWIN Robert G. Gwin Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer February17, 2016 83 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Anadarko Petroleum Corporation: We have audited Anadarko Petroleum Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2015 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) .
Anadarko Petroleum Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regardingthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

90 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies General Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is engaged in the exploration, development, production, and marketing of oil, condensate, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (NGLs), and in the marketing of anticipated production of liquefied natural gas(LNG). In addition, the Company engages in the gathering,processing, treating, and transporting of oil, natural gas, and NGLs. The Company also participates in the hard-minerals business through royalty arrangements. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms Anadarko and Company refer to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Anadarko and entities in which it holds a controlling interest. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Undivided interests in oil and natural-gas exploration and production joint ventures are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in non-controlled entities, over which Anadarko has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method. In applying the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognized at cost, and subsequently adjusted for the Companys proportionate share of earnings, losses, and distributions. Other investments are carried at original cost. Investments accounted for using the equity method and cost method are reported as a component of other assets. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Management evaluates its estimates and related assumptions regularly, including those related to proved reserves; the value of properties and equipment; goodwill; intangible assets; asset retirement obligations; litigation liabilities; environmental liabilities; pension assets, liabilities, and costs; income taxes; and fair values. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates, and actual results may differ from these estimates.
Fair Value Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Inputs used in determining fair value are characterized according to a hierarchy that prioritizes those inputs based on the degree to which they are observable. The three input levels of the fair-value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (for example, exchange-traded futures contracts for which parties are willing to transact at the exchange-quoted price).
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (for example, quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets not considered to be active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, or market-corroborated inputs).
Level 3 Inputs that are not observable from objective sources such as the Companys internally developed assumptions used in pricing an asset or liability (for example, an estimate of future cash flows used in the Companys internally developed present value of future cash flows model that underlies the fair-value measurement).
In determining fair value, the Company uses observable market data when available, or models that incorporate observable market data. In addition to market information, the Company incorporates transaction-specific details that, in managements judgment, market participants would take into account in measuring fair value.
91 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) In arriving at fair-value estimates, the Company uses relevant observable inputs available for the valuation technique employed. If a fair-value measurement reflects inputs at multiple levels within the hierarchy, the fair-value measurement is characterized based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair-value measurement. For Anadarko, recurring fair-value measurements are performed for interest-rate derivatives, commodity derivatives, and investments in trading securities.
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable reported on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets approximates fair value. The fair value of debt is the estimated amount the Company would have to pay to repurchase its debt, including any premium or discount attributable to the difference between the stated interest rate and market interest rate at each balance sheet date. Debt fair values, as disclosed in Note11Debt and Interest Expense , are based on quoted market prices for identical instruments, if available, or based on valuations of similar debt instruments.
Non-financial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value include certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination or through a non-monetary exchange transaction, intangible assets, goodwill, asset retirement obligations, exit or disposal costs, and capital lease assets where the present value of lease payments is greater than the fair value of the leased asset.
Revenues The Companys oil and condensate are sold primarily to marketers, gatherers, and refiners. Natural gas is sold primarily to interstate and intrastate natural-gas pipelines, direct end-users, industrial users, local distribution companies, and natural-gas marketers. NGLs are sold primarily to direct end-users, refiners, and marketers.
The Company recognizes sales revenues for oil and condensate, natural gas, and NGLs based on the amount of each product sold to purchasers when delivery to the purchaser has occurred and title has transferred. This occurs when product has been delivered to a pipeline or when a tanker lifting has occurred. The Company follows the sales method of accounting for natural-gas production imbalances. If the Companys sales volumes for a well exceed the Companys proportionate share of production from the well, a liability is recognized to the extent that the Companys share of estimated remaining recoverable reserves from the well is insufficient to satisfy this imbalance. No receivables are recorded for those wells on which the Company has taken less than its proportionate share of production.
Anadarko provides gathering, processing, treating, and transporting services pursuant to a variety of contracts. Under these arrangements, the Company receives fees, or retains a percentage of products or a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of products and recognizes revenue at the time services are performed or product is sold. These revenues are included in gathering, processing, and marketing sales in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income.
Marketing margins related to the Companys production are included in oil and condensate sales, natural-gas sales, and NGLs sales. Marketing margins related to sales of commodities purchased from third parties and gains and losses on derivatives related to such marketing activities are included in gathering, processing, and marketing sales in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income.
The Company enters into buy/sell arrangements related to the transportation of a portion of its oil production. Under these arrangements, barrels are sold to a third party at a location-based contract price and subsequently repurchased by the Company at a downstream location. The difference in value between the sale and purchase price represents the transportation fee from the lease or certain gathering locations to more liquid markets. These arrangements are often required by private transporters. These transactions are reported on a net basis and included in oil and gas transportation in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income.
Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
92 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts The Company conducts credit analyses of customers prior to making any sales to new customers or increasing credit for existing customers. Based on these analyses, the Company may require a standby letter of credit or a financial guarantee. The Company charges uncollectible accounts receivable against the allowance for uncollectible accounts when it determines collection will no longer be pursued.
Inventories Commodity inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market.
Properties and Equipment Properties and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A). Costs of improvements that appreciably improve the efficiency or productive capacity of existing properties or extend their lives are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of properties and equipment, net of the related accumulated DD&A, is removed and, if appropriate, gain or loss is recognized in gains (losses) on divestitures and other, net in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income.
Oil and Gas Properties The Company applies the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties. Exploration costs, such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals, and exploration overhead, are charged against earnings as incurred. If an exploratory well provides evidence to justify potential completion as a producing well, drilling costs associated with the well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling. This determination may take longer than one year in certain areas (generally in deepwater and international locations) depending on, among other things, the amount of hydrocarbons discovered, the outcome of planned geological and engineering studies, the need for additional appraisal drilling activities to determine whether the discovery is sufficient to support an economic development plan, and government sanctioning of development activities in certain international locations. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities, in particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, analyzing whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed.
Acquisition costs of unproved properties are periodically assessed for impairment and are transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent the costs are associated with successful exploration activities. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment, based on the Companys current exploration plans, and a valuation allowance is provided if impairment is indicated. Unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs are amortized on a group basis (thereby establishing a valuation allowance) over the average lease terms at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration or abandonment. Costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged against the valuation allowance, while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Costs of maintaining and retaining unproved properties, as well as amortization of individually insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases, are included in exploration expense in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income.
93 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Capitalized Interest For significant projects, interest is capitalized as part of the historical cost of developing and constructing assets. Significant oil and gas investments in unproved properties, significant exploration and development projects that have not commenced production, significant midstream development activities that are in progress, and investments in equity-method affiliates that are undergoing the construction of assets that have not commenced principle operations qualify for interest capitalization. Interest is capitalized until the asset is ready for service. Capitalized interest is determined by multiplying the Companys weighted-average borrowing cost on debt by the average amount of qualifying costs incurred. Once an asset subject to interest capitalization is completed and placed in service, the associated capitalized interest is expensed through depreciation or impairment. See Note11Debt and Interest Expense .
Asset Retirement Obligations Asset retirement obligations (AROs) associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets are recognized as liabilities with an increase to the carrying amounts of the related long-lived assets in the period incurred. The cost of the tangible asset, including the asset retirement cost, is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. AROs are recorded at estimated fair value, measured by reference to the expected future cash outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligations discounted at the Companys credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liabilities are accreted to their expected settlement value and is included in DD&A in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. If estimated future costs of AROs change, an adjustment is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the long-lived asset. Revisions to estimated AROs can result from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation rates, and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment. See Note13Asset Retirement Obligations .
Impairments Properties and equipment are reviewed for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that net book values may not be recoverable. In performing this review, an undiscounted cash flow test is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of cash flows from other assets. If the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the net book value of the property, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess, if any, of the propertys net book value over its estimated fair value. See Note5Impairments .
Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization Costs of drilling and equipping successful wells, costs to construct or acquire facilities other than offshore platforms, associated asset retirement costs, and capital lease assets used in oiland gas activities are depreciated using the unit-of-production (UOP) method based on total estimated proved developedoil and gas reserves. Costs of acquiring proved properties, including leasehold acquisition costs transferred from unproved properties and costs to construct or acquire offshore platforms and associated asset retirement costs, are depleted using the UOP method based on total estimated proved developed and undeveloped reserves. Mineral properties are also depleted using the UOP method. All other properties are stated at historical acquisition cost, net of impairments, and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 15 years for furniture and equipment, up to 40 years for buildings, and up to 47 years for gathering facilities.
94 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Anadarko has allocated goodwill to the following reporting units: oil and gas exploration and production; Western Gas Partners, LP (WES) gathering and processing; WES transportation; and other gathering and processing. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing in October(or more frequent testing as circumstances dictate). Anadarkos goodwill impairment test first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill is impaired. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, the Company will then perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Changes in goodwill may result from, among other things, impairments, acquisitions, or divestitures. See Note7Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets .
Other intangible assets represent contractual rights obtained in connection with business combinations that had favorable contractual terms relative to market at the acquisition date as well as customer-related intangible assets, including customer relationships established by acquired contracts. Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are assessed for impairment whenever impairment indicators are present. See Note7Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets .
Derivative Instruments Anadarko uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to cash-flow variability from commodity-price and interest-rate risks. Derivatives are carried on the balance sheet at fair value and are included in other current assets, other assets, accrued expenses, or other long-term liabilities, depending on the derivative position and the expected timing of settlement, unless they satisfy the normal purchases and sales exception criteria. Where the Company has the contractual right and intends to net settle, derivative assets and liabilities are reported on a net basis.
Gains and losses on derivative instruments are recognized currently in earnings. Net losses attributable to derivatives previously subjecttohedge accounting reside in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will be reclassified toearnings in future periods as the economic transactions to which the derivatives relate affect earnings. See Note9Derivative Instruments .
AccountsPayable Accounts payable included liabilities of $365 million at December31,2015 , and $388million at December31,2014 , representing the amount by which checks issued, but not presented to the Companys banks for collection, exceeded balances in applicable bank accounts. Changes in these liabilities are reflected in cash flows from financing activities.
Legal Contingencies The Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business. Except for legal contingencies acquired in a business combination, which are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition, the Company accrues losses associated with legal claims when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. If the Company determines that a loss is probable and cannot estimate a specific amount for that loss, but can estimate a range of loss, the best estimate within the range is accrued. If no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. Estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes available or circumstances change. Legal defense costs associated with loss contingencies are expensed in the period incurred. See Note15Contingencies .

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Environmental Contingencies The Company is subject to various environmental-remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Except for environmental contingencies acquired in a business combination, which are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition, the Company accrues losses associated with environmental obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. Accruals for estimated environmental losses are recognized no later than at the time the remediation feasibility study, or the evaluation of response options, is complete. These accruals are adjusted as additional information becomes available or circumstances change. Future environmental expenditures are not discounted to their present value. Recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recorded separately as assets at their undiscounted value when receipt of such recoveries is probable. See Note15Contingencies .
Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests represent third-party ownership in the net assets of theCompanys consolidated subsidiaries and are presented as a component of equity. Changes in Anadarkosownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in deconsolidation are recognized in equity. See Note20Noncontrolling Interests .
Income Taxes The Company files various U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax returns. Deferred federal, state, and foreign income taxes are provided on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. The Company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recorded is equal to the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be realized through final settlement with a taxing authority. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax expense (benefit). The Company uses the flow-through method to account for its investment tax credits. See Note12Income Taxes .
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . This ASU requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities, including any related valuation allowance, to be presented in the balance sheet as noncurrent. The Company has elected to adopt this ASU early using a retrospective approach. As a result of adoption, the Company reclassified $722 million from other current assets to deferred income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2014. See Note12Income Taxes .
Share-Based Compensation The Company accounts for share-based compensation at fair value. The Company grants equity-classified awards, including stock options and non-vested equity shares (restricted stock awards and units). The Company may also grant equity-classified and liability-classified awards based on a comparison of the Companys total shareholder return (TSR) to the TSR of a predetermined group of peer companies (performanceunits).
The fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Restricted stock awards and units are valued using the market price of Anadarko common stock. For other share-based compensation awards, fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation.
The Company records compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, for share-based compensation awards over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. An adjustment is made to compensation cost for any difference between the estimated forfeitures and the actual forfeitures related to the awards. For equity-classified share-based compensation awards, expense is recognized based on the grant-date fair value. For liability-classified share-based compensation awards, expense is recognized for those awards expected to ultimately be paid. The amount of expense reported for liability-classified awards is adjusted for fair-value changes so that the expense recognized for each award is equivalent to the amount to be paid. See Note19Share-Based Compensation .

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Recently Issued Accounting Standards The FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial InstrumentsOverall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Subtopic 825-10).
This ASU amends existing requirements on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current requirements primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning in 2018 with early adoption of certain provisions permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.
The FASB issued ASU 2015-03, InterestImputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30)Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs and ASU 2015-15, InterestImputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30)Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements . These ASUs require capitalized debt issuance costs, except for those related to revolving credit facilities, to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, rather than as an asset. The Company adopted these ASUs on January 1, 2016, using a retrospective approach. The adoption will result in a reclassification that will reduce other current assets and short-term debt by $1million and reduce other assets and long-term debt by $82 million on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December31,2015 , when included in future filings.
The FASB issued ASU 2015-02, ConsolidationAmendments to the Consolidation Analysis . This ASU amends existing requirements applicable to reporting entities that are required to evaluate consolidation of a legal entity under the variable interest entity (VIE) or voting interest entity models. The provisions will affect how limited partnerships and similar entities are assessed for consolidation, including an additional requirement that a limited partnership will be a VIE unless the limited partners have either substantive kick-out or participating rights over the general partner. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning in 2016 and is required to be adopted using a retrospective or modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted. The Company has evaluated the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and determined that Western Gas Equity Partners, LP (WGP), and WES, publicly traded consolidated subsidiaries of the Company, meet the criteria for variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary for accounting purposes. The adoption of this ASU will not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements; however, the VIE disclosure requirements will begin to apply in 2016 for the Companys interest in WGP and WES.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition , and industry-specific guidance in Subtopic 932-605, Extractive Activities-Oil and Gas-Revenue Recognition and requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company is required to adopt the new standard in the first quarter of 2018 using one of two retrospective application methods, with early adoption permitted in 2017. The Company is continuing to evaluate the provisions of this ASU, and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures or decided upon the method of adoption.
2.  Inventories The following summarizes the major classes of inventories included in other current assets at December31: millions 2015 2014 Oil $ 116 $ 133 Natural gas 36 27 NGLs 64 83 Total inventories $ 216 $ 243 97 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013 3.  Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Assets Held for Sale Acquisitions In November 2014, WES acquired Nuevo Midstream, LLC (Nuevo), which owns and operates gathering and processing assets in the Delaware basin in West Texas, for $1.557billion . Following the acquisition, WES changed the name of Nuevo to Delaware Basin Midstream, LLC (DBM). This acquisition constitutes a business combination and was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. This acquisition aligns the Companys gas gathering and processing capacity with future industry production growth plans in the Delaware basin. Preliminary fair-value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were finalized in the fourth quarter of 2015. There were no material changes to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the amounts included on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December31,2014. The following summarizes the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date: millions Current assets $ 63 Properties and equipment 467 Other intangible assets 811 Accounts payable (19 ) Accrued expenses (38 ) Deferred income taxes (1 ) Asset retirement obligations (9 ) Goodwill 283 Total assets acquired and liabilities assumed $ 1,557 Fair-value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 inputs. The fair value of properties and equipment is based on market and cost approaches. Intangible assets consist of customer contracts, the fair value of which was determined using an income approach. Deferred tax assets (liabilities) represent the tax effects of differences in the tax basis and acquisition-date fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. All of the goodwill related to this acquisition is amortizable for tax purposes. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included within the midstream reporting segment.
Results of operations attributable to this acquisition are included in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income from the date acquired. The amounts of revenue and earnings included in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December31,2014, and the amounts of revenue and earnings that would have been recognized had the acquisition occurred on January1,2014, are not material to the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income.
98 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013 3.  Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Assets Held for Sale (Continued) Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale The following summarizes the proceeds received and gains (losses) recognized on divestitures for the years ended December 31: millions 2015 2014 2013 Proceeds received $ 1,415 $ 4,968 $ 567 Gains (losses) on divestitures, net (1,022 ) 1,891 (470 ) 2015  The Company sold certain coalbed methane properties and related midstream assets in the Rocky Mountains Region (Rockies) for net proceeds of $154 million , after closing adjustments, and recognized a loss of $538million . These assets were included in the oil and gas exploration and production and midstream reportingsegments.
The Company sold certain U.S. onshore oil and gas properties and related midstream assets in East Texas, with a sales price of $440 million , for net proceeds of $425 million after closing adjustments, and recognized a loss of $110 million . These assets were included in the oil and gas exploration and production and midstream reporting segments.
The Company sold certain enhanced oil recovery (EOR) assets in the Rockies, with a sales price of $703million , for net proceeds of $675 million after closing adjustments, and recognized a loss of $350million . These assets were included in the oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment.
2014 Total proceeds and net gains on divestitures during 2014 primarily related to assets included in the oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment as follows:  The Company sold a 10% working interest in Offshore Area 1 in Mozambique for $2.64billion and recognized a gain of $1.5billion .
The Company sold its Chinese subsidiary for $1.075billion and recognized a gain of $510million .
The Company sold its interest in the nonoperated Vito deepwater development, along with several surrounding exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico for $500million , and recognized a gain of $237million .
The Company sold its interest in the Pinedale/Jonah assets in Wyoming for $581million .
During the fourth quarter of 2014, Anadarko considered certain EOR assets in the Rockies to be held for sale and recognized losses of $456million . These assets were remeasured to their fair value using a market approach and Level 2 fair-value measurement. Volatility in the then-current commodity-price environment had reduced the probability that the assets would be sold within one year and the assets were therefore no longer considered held for sale at December31,2014 .
2013  The Company sold its interests in a soda ash joint venture and certain U.S. onshore and Indonesian oil and gas properties and recognized net gains of $234 million , primarily related to the Companys divestiture of its interests in the soda ash joint venture and certain U.S. oil and gas properties included in the oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment.
The Company recognized losses of $704million primarily related to its Pinedale/Jonah assets included in the oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment considered to be held for sale at December31,2013. The sale of these assets closed in 2014 as discussed above.
99 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013 3.  Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Assets Held for Sale (Continued) Property Exchange In 2013, the Company exchanged certain oil and gas properties in the Wattenberg field with a third party. The properties exchanged were measured at the Companys historical net cost with no gain or loss recognized. Anadarko paid $106 million in cash as part of the exchange, which is included as an addition to properties and equipment on the Companys Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December31,2013 .
4.  Properties and Equipment The following summarizes properties and equipment by segment at December31: millions 2015 2014 Oil and gas exploration and production (1) $ 59,389 $ 63,674 Midstream 8,458 8,647 Other 2,836 2,786 Gross properties and equipment $ 70,683 $ 75,107 Less accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization 36,932 33,518 Net properties and equipment $ 33,751 $ 41,589 __________________________________________________________________ (1) Includes costs associated with unproved properties of $3.5billion at December31,2015 , and $5.1billion at December31,2014 .

Impairments Impairments of proved properties are included in impairment expense in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. The following summarizes impairments of proved properties and the related post-impairment fair values by segment at December 31: 2015 2014 2013 millions Impairment Fair Value (1) Impairment Fair Value (1) Impairment Fair Value (1) Oil and gas exploration and production Long-lived assets held for use U.S. onshore properties $ 3,684 $ 1,253 $ 545 $ 552 $ 142 $ 271 Gulf of Mexico properties 349 65 276 223 562 242 Cost-method investment (2) 3 32 3 32 11 32 Midstream Long-lived assets held for use 1,039 212 12  79 36 Total impairments $ 5,075 $ 1,562 $ 836 $ 807 $ 794 $ 581 __________________________________________________________________ (1) Measured as of the impairment date using the income approach and Level 3 inputs.
(2) Represents the after-tax net investment.
2015 Impairments In2015, impairments were primarily related to the Companys Greater Natural Buttes oil and gas and midstream properties in the Rockies, other U.S. onshore oil and gas properties primarily in the Southern and Appalachia Region, other midstream properties primarily in the Rockies, and oil and gas properties in the Gulf of Mexico, all of which were impaired due to lower forecasted commodity prices.
2014 Impairments In 2014, certain U.S. onshore and Gulf of Mexico oil and gas properties were impaired primarily due to lower forecasted commodity prices.
2013 Impairments In 2013, certain Gulf of Mexico properties were impaired due to a reduction in estimated future net cash flows and downward revisions of reserves resulting from changes to the Companys development plans. Also in 2013, certain U.S. onshore properties and related midstream assets were impaired due to downward revisions of reserves resulting from changes to the Companys development plans. In addition, a midstream property was impaired during 2013 due to a reduction in estimated future cash flows.
Impairments of Unproved Properties Impairments of unproved properties are included in exploration expense in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2015, the Company recognized a $935 million impairment of unproved Greater Natural Buttes properties and a $66 million impairment of an unproved Gulf of Mexico property as a result of lower commodity prices. Also in 2015, the Company recognized a $109 million impairment of unproved Utica properties resulting from an assignment of mineral interests in settlement of a legal matter.
101 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013 5.  Impairments (Continued) Potential for Future Impairments During 2015, the Company recognized significant impairments of proved oil and gas and midstream properties and impairments of unproved oil and gas properties, primarily as a result of lower forecasted commodity prices and changes to the Companys drilling plans. At December31,2015, the Companys estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to a certain depletion group with a net book value of approximately $2.2billion indicated that the carrying amount was expected to be recovered; however, this depletion group may be at risk for impairment if the estimates of future cash flows decline. The Company estimates that, if this depletion group becomes impaired in a future period, the Company could recognize non-cash impairments in that period in excess of $800million . It is also reasonably possible that prolonged low or further declines in commodity prices, further changes to the Companys drilling plans in response to lower prices, or increases in drilling or operating costs could result in other additional impairments.
6.  Suspended Exploratory Well Costs The following summarizes the changes in suspended exploratory well costs at December31 for each of the last three years. Additions pending the determination of proved reserves excludes amounts capitalized and subsequently charged to expense within the same year.
millions 2015 2014 2013 Balance at January1 $ 1,522 $ 2,232 $ 2,062 Additions pending the determination of proved reserves 461 421 848 Divestitures and other (1) (33 ) (913 ) (48 ) Reclassifications to proved properties (104 ) (100 ) (507 ) Charges to exploration expense (2) (722 ) (118 ) (123 ) Balance at December31 $ 1,124 $ 1,522 $ 2,232 __________________________________________________________________ (1) Includes $(744)million during 2014 related to the Companys sale of a 10% working interest in Offshore Area 1 in Mozambique.
(2) Includes $(565) million during 2015 related to Brazil. Given the current oil-price environment and other considerations, the Company does not expect to have substantive exploration and development activities in Brazil in the foreseeable future.
The following provides an aging of suspended well balances at December31: millions 2015 2014 2013 Exploratory well costs capitalized for a period of one year or less $ 452 $ 393 $ 836 Exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year 672 1,129 1,396 Balance at December 31 $ 1,124 $ 1,522 $ 2,232 102 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013 6.  Suspended Exploratory Well Costs (Continued) The following summarizes a further aging by geographic area of those exploratory well costs that have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling at December31,2015 : millions except projects Number of Projects Total 2014 2013 2012and prior United StatesOnshore 18 $ 55 $ 34 $ 11 $ 10 United StatesOffshore 4 314 77 80 157 International 7 303 119 3 181 29 $ 672 $ 230 $ 94 $ 348 Projects with suspended exploratory well costs are those identified by management as exhibiting sufficient quantities of hydrocarbons to justify potential development and where management is actively pursuing efforts to assess whether reserves can be attributed to these projects. Suspended exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year after completion of drilling at December31,2015 , primarily related to the Gulf of Mexico, Ghana, and Mozambique.
For projects located in the Gulf of Mexico, the majority of exploratory well costs capitalized greater than one year are related to the Shenandoah discovery. Well costs have been suspended pending further appraisal activities, including drilling and analysis of well results. Appraisal activities undertaken at the Shenandoah discovery include the acquisition of whole-core across the primary reservoir interval, the processing and analysis of seismic data, reservoir simulation modeling, and analysis of well results. Remaining activities required to classify the associated reserves as proved for the Shenandoah discovery include completion of geologic, reservoir, and economic modeling; product development testing; and pre-front-end engineering and design (FEED) and FEED engineering studies.
For projects located in Ghana, exploratory well costs that have been capitalized greater than one year are pending development plan approval. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company and its partners submitted the Jubilee full field development plan for the Mahogany East and Teak areas. Remaining activities required to classify the associated reserves as proved include approval of development plans and project sanctioning.
For projects located in Mozambique, the majority of exploratory well costs capitalized greater than one year are related to the Orca, Tubaro, and Tubaro Tigre discoveries. Well costs have been suspended pending further appraisal activities, including analysis of well results and seismic reprocessing. During 2015, drilling and evaluation operations at the Tubaro Tigre-2 appraisal well were completed. Anadarko is continuing to appraise the Orca, Tubaro, and Tubaro Tigre discoveries in accordance with the appraisal programs provided to the government of Mozambique in the first quarter of 2015.
If additional information becomes available that raises substantial doubt as to the economic or operational viability of any of these projects, the associated costs will be expensed at that time.
103 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013 7.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill At December31,2015 , the Company had $5.4billion of goodwill allocated to the following reporting units: $4.9billion to oil and gas exploration and production, $383 million to WES gathering and processing, $5million to WES transportation, and $62 million to other gathering and processing. The Companys 2015 annual impairment assessment of goodwill indicated no impairment. An additional assessment was also performed in December 2015 to consider the impact of commodity-price changes since the annual test. This assessment also indicated no impairment.
Although commodity prices declined during the year, as of December31,2015, the estimated fair value of the oil and gas reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by more than 15% , without consideration for any control premium, and the other reporting units were not at risk of impairment. However, prolonged low or further declines in commodity prices, decreases in proved reserves, changes in exploration or development plans, significant property impairments, increases in operating or drilling costs, significant changes in regulations, or other negative changes to the economic environment in which Anadarko operates, could result in further goodwill impairment tests in the near term, the results of which may have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations.
Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets and associated amortization expense were as follows: millions GrossCarrying Amount Accumulated Amortization NetCarrying Amount Amortization Expense December31,2015 Offshore platform leases $ 33 $ (31 ) $ 2 $ 2 Customer contracts 980 (46 ) 934 31 $ 1,013 $ (77 ) $ 936 $ 33 December31,2014 Offshore platform leases $ 33 $ (29 ) $ 4 $  Customer contracts 1,004 (15 ) 989 6 $ 1,037 $ (44 ) $ 993 $ 6 Customer contract intangible assets are primarily related to WESs DBM acquisition in 2014. These contracts are being amortized over 30 years . See Note3Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Assets Held for Sale . The annual aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets is expected to be $31million each of the next five years.
104 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013 8.  Equity-Method Investments In 2007, Anadarko contributed certain of its oil and gas properties and gathering and processing assets, with an aggregate fair value of $2.9 billion at the time of the contribution, to newly formed unconsolidated entities in exchange for noncontrolling mandatorily redeemable London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) based preferred interests in those entities. The common equity of the investee entities is 95% owned by third parties that also maintain control over the assets. Subsequent to their formation, the investee entities loaned Anadarko an aggregate of $2.9 billion . The Company accounts for its investment in these entities using the equity method of accounting. The carrying amount of these investments was $2.8 billion and the carrying amount of notes payable to affiliates was $2.9 billion at December31,2015 . Anadarko has legal right of setoff and intends to net settle its obligations under each of the notes payable to the investees with the distributable value of its interest in the corresponding investee. Accordingly, the investments and the obligations are presented net on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets in other long-term liabilitiesother for all periods presented.
Interest on the notes issued by Anadarko is variable, and is equivalent to LIBOR plus a spread that fluctuates with Anadarkos credit rating. The applicable interest rate was 1.51% at December31,2015 , and 1.24% at December31,2014 . The note payable agreement contains a covenant that provides for a maximum Anadarko debt-to-capital ratio of 67% (excluding the effect of non-cash write-downs). Anadarko was in compliance with this covenant at December31,2015 . Other (income) expense, net includes interest expense onthe notes payable of $37 million in 2015 , $36 million in 2014 , and $37 million in 2013 , and equity (earnings) losses from Anadarkos investments in the investee entities of $15 million in 2015 , $(45) million in 2014 , and $(42) million in 2013 .
9.  Derivative Instruments Objective and Strategy The Company uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to cash-flow variability from commodity-price and interest-rate risks. Futures, swaps, and options are used to manage exposure to commodity-price risk inherent in the Companys oil and natural-gas production and natural-gas processing operations (Oil and Natural-Gas Production/Processing Derivative Activities). Futures contracts and commodity-price swap agreements are used to fix the price of expected future oil and natural-gas sales at major industry trading locations such as Henry Hub, Louisiana for natural gas and Cushing, Oklahoma or Sullom Voe, Scotland for oil. Basis swaps are periodically used to fix or float the price differential between product prices at one market location versus another. Options are used to establish a floor price, a ceiling price, or a floor and a ceiling price (collar) for expected future oil and natural-gas sales. Derivative instruments are also used to manage commodity-price risk inherent in customer price requirements and to fix margins on the future sale of natural gas and NGLs from the Companys leased storagefacilities (Marketing and Trading Derivative Activities).
Interest-rate swaps are used to fix or float interest rates on existing or anticipated indebtedness. The purpose of these instruments is to manage the Companys existing or anticipated exposure to interest-rate changes. The fair value of the Companys current interest-rate swap portfolio increases (decreases) when interest rates increase(decrease).
The Company does not apply hedge accounting to any of its derivative instruments. As a result, gains and losses associated with derivative instruments are recognized currently in earnings. Net derivative losses attributable to derivatives previously subject to hedge accounting reside in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to earnings as the transactions to which the derivatives relate are recognized in earnings.See Note18Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) .

Derivative Instruments (Continued) Oil and Natural-Gas Production/Processing Derivative Activities The oil prices listed below are a combination of New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) West Texas Intermediate and Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE) Brent Blend prices. The natural-gas prices listed below are NYMEX Henry Hub prices. The NGLs prices listed below are Oil Price Information Services prices (OPIS). The following is a summary of the Companys derivative instruments related to oil and natural-gas production/processing derivative activities at December31,2015 : 2016 Settlement Oil Three-Way Collars (MBbls/d) 83 Average price per barrel Ceiling sold price (call) $ 63.82 Floor purchased price (put) $ 54.46 Floor sold price (put) $ 42.77 Natural Gas Fixed-Price Contracts (thousand MMBtu/d) 38 Average price per MMBtu $ 2.53 NGLs Fixed-Price Contracts (MBbls/d) 4 Average price per barrel $ 13.07 __________________________________________________________________ MMBtumillion British thermal units MMBtu/dmillion British thermal units per day A three-way collar is a combination of three options: a sold call, a purchased put, and a sold put. The sold call establishes the maximum price that the Company will receive for the contracted commodity volumes. The purchased put establishes the minimum price that the Company will receive for the contracted volumes unless the market price for the commodity falls below the sold put strike price, at which point the minimum price equals the reference price (e.g., NYMEX) plus the excess of the purchased put strike price over the sold put strike price.
In 2014, the Company terminated or offset then-existing 2015 oil three-way collars with a notional volume of 25 thousand barrels per day due to lower oil prices, resulting in a cash receipt of $126 million .
Marketing and Trading Derivative Activities The Company had financial derivative transactions with notional volumes of natural gas totaling 8 billion cubic feet(Bcf) at December31,2015 , and 6 Bcf at December31,2014 , that were entered into to mitigate commodity-price risk related to fixed-price purchase and sales contracts and storageactivity.
106 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013 9.  Derivative Instruments (Continued) Interest-Rate Derivatives Anadarko has outstanding interest-rate swap contracts to manage interest-rate risk associated with anticipated debt issuances. The Company has locked in a fixed interest rate in exchange for a floating interest rate indexed to the three-month LIBOR.
In 2015, the Company extended the reference-period start dates on interest-rate swaps with an aggregate notional principal amount of $1.0 billion to align the portfolio with anticipated debt refinancing. The Company also amended the mandatory termination dates on interest-rate swaps with an aggregate notional principal amount of $1.8billion so that, at the start of the reference period, Anadarko will receive quarterly payments based on the floating rate and make semi-annual payments based on the fixed interest rate. The interest-rate swaps are required to be settled in full at the mandatory termination date.As part of these interest-rate swap modifications, the fixed interest rates on the swaps were also adjusted, and the Company recognized a loss of $137million , which is included in gains (losses) on derivatives, net in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income, and increased the related derivative liability. In 2014, in anticipation of the July 2014 issuance of an aggregate $1.25 billion of Senior Notes, interest-rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of $750 million were settled in 2014, resulting in a cash payment of $222million .
Derivative settlements and collateralization are classified as cash flows from operating activities unless the derivatives contain an other-than-insignificant financing element, in which case the settlements and collateralization are classified as cash flows from financing activities. As a result of prior extensions of reference-period start dates without settlement of the related interest-rate derivative obligations, the interest-rate derivatives in the Companys portfolio contain an other-than-insignificant financing element, and therefore, any settlements or collateralization related to these extended interest-rate derivatives are classified as cash flows from financing activities.

Derivative Instruments (Continued) Credit-Risk Considerations The financial integrity of exchange-traded contracts, which are subject to nominal credit risk, is assured by NYMEX or ICE through systems of financial safeguards and transaction guarantees. Over-the-counter traded swaps, options, and futures contracts expose the Company to counterparty credit risk. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties, establishes credit limits according to the Companys credit policies and guidelines, and assesses the impact on the fair value of its counterparties creditworthiness. The Company has the ability to require cash collateral or letters of credit to mitigate its credit-risk exposure.
The Company has netting agreements with financial institutions that permit net settlement of gross commodity derivative assets against gross commodity derivative liabilities, and routinely exercises its contractual right to offset gains and losses when settling with derivative counterparties. In addition, the Company has setoff agreements with certain financial institutions that may be exercised in the event of default and provide for contract termination and net settlement across derivative types. At December31,2015 , $347 million of the Companys $1.722billion gross derivative liability balance, and at December31,2014 , $289million of the Companys $1.455billion gross derivative liability balance would have been eligible for setoff against the Companys gross derivative asset balance in the event of default. Other than in the event of default, the Company does not net settle across derivative types.
The Companys derivative instruments are subject to individually negotiated credit provisions that may require collateral of cash or letters of credit depending on the derivatives valuation versus negotiated credit thresholds. These credit thresholds may also require full or partial collateralization or immediate settlement of the Companys obligations if certain credit-risk-related provisions are triggered such as if the Companys credit rating from major credit rating agencies declines to a level that is below investment grade. Previously, most of the Companys derivative counterparties maintained secured positions with respect to the Companys derivative liabilities under the Companys $5.0 billion senior secured revolving credit facility ($5.0 billion Facility). In January 2015, the Companys $5.0billion Facility was replaced by new unsecured facilities under which the Companys derivative counterparties no longer maintain security interests in any of the Companys assets. As a result, the Company may be required from time to time to post collateralof cash or letters of credit based on the negotiated terms of the individual derivative agreements. The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features for which a net liability position existed was $1.3 billion (net of collateral) at December31,2015 , and $97million (net of collateral) at December31,2014 . For information on the Companys revolving credit facilities, see Note11Debt and Interest Expense Anadarko Revolving Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Program .

Derivative Instruments (Continued) Fair Value Fair value of futures contracts is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, which represent Level 1 inputs. Valuations of physical-delivery purchase and sale agreements, over-the-counter financial swaps, and commodity option collars are based on similar transactions observable in active markets and industry-standard models that primarily rely on market-observable inputs. Inputs used to estimate fair value in industry-standard models are categorized as Level 2 inputs because substantially all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the full term of the instruments. Inputs used to estimate the fair value of swaps and options include market-price curves; contract terms and prices; credit-risk adjustments; and, for Black-Scholes option valuations, discount factors and implied market volatility.

Tangible Equity Units In June2015, the Company issued 9.2 million 7.50% tangible equity units (TEUs) at a stated amount of $50.00 per TEU and raised net proceeds of $445 million . Each TEU is comprised of a prepaid equity purchase contract for common units of WGP and a senior amortizing note. Subsequent to issuance, each TEU may be legally separated into the two components. The prepaid equity purchase contract is considered a freestanding financial instrument, indexed to WGP common units, and meets the conditions for equity classification.
Anadarko allocated the proceeds from the issuance of the TEUs to equity and debt based on the relative fair values of their respective components as follows: millions, except price per TEU Equity Component Debt Component Total Price per TEU $ 39.05 $ 10.95 $ 50.00 Gross proceeds 359 101 460 Less issuance costs 11 4 15 Net proceeds $ 348 $ 97 $ 445 The prepaid equity purchase contracts were recorded in noncontrolling interests, net of issuance costs, and the senior amortizing notes were recorded in short-term debt and long-term debt on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Equity Component Unless settled earlier at the holders option, each purchase contract has a mandatory settlement date of June7, 2018 . Anadarko has a right to elect to issue and deliver shares of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation common stock (APC shares) in lieu of delivering WGP common units at settlement. The Company will deliver WGP common units (or APC shares) on the settlement date at the settlement rate based upon the applicable market value of WGP common units (or APC shares) as follows: Settlement Rate per Purchase Contract Applicable Market Value of WGP Common Units (1) WGP Common Units APC Shares (if elected) (1) Exceeds $69.8422 (Threshold Appreciation Price) 0.7159 units (Minimum Settlement Rate) a number of shares equal to (a) the Minimum Settlement Rate, multiplied by the applicable market value of WGP common units, divided by (b) 98% of the applicable market value of APC shares Less than or equal to the Threshold Appreciation Price, but greater than or equal to $58.20 (Reference Price) a number of units equal to $50.00, divided by the applicable market value of WGP common units a number of shares equal to $50.00, divided by 98% of the applicable market value of APC shares Less than the Reference Price 0.8591 units (Maximum Settlement Rate) a number of shares equal to (a) the Maximum Settlement Rate, multiplied by the applicable market value of WGP common units, divided by (b) 98% of the applicable market value of APC shares __________________________________________________________________ (1) The applicable market value is the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of WGP common units (or APC shares) for the 20 consecutive trading days beginning on, and including, the 23 rd scheduled trading day immediately preceding June7,2018.
111 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013 10.  Tangible Equity Units (Continued) The WGP common units underlying the purchase contract are currently issued and outstanding, and are owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of Anadarko. In the event Anadarko elects to settle in APC shares, the number of such shares issued and delivered upon settlement of each purchase contract is subject to adjustment and cannot exceed four shares under any circumstance (APC share cap). The above fixed settlement rates for WGP common units and the APC share cap are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified dilutive events such as certain increases in the WGP distribution rate.
Debt Component Each senior amortizing note has an initial principal amount of $10.95 and bears interest at 1.50% peryear. Beginning September7, 2015 , Anadarko will pay equal quarterly cash installments of $0.9375 per amortizing note (except for the September7,2015 installment payment, which was $0.9063 per amortizing note). The payments constitute a payment of interest and partial repayment of principal, with the aggregate per-year payments of principal and interest equating to a 7.50% cash payment with respect to each TEU. The senior amortizing notes have a final installment payment date of June7, 2018 , and are senior unsecured obligations of the Company.

Debt and Interest Expense (Continued) In a 2006 private offering, Anadarko received $500 million of loan proceeds upon issuing the Zero-Coupon Senior Notes due 2036 (Zero Coupons). The Zero Coupons mature in 2036 and have an aggregate principal amount due at maturity of approximately $2.4 billion , reflecting a yield to maturity of 5.24% . The Zero Coupons can be put to the Company in October of each year, in whole or in part, for the then-accreted value of the outstanding Zero Coupons. The accreted value of the outstanding Zero Coupons was $806million at December31,2015 . Anadarkos Zero Coupons were classified as long-term debt on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December31,2015, as the Company has the ability and intent to refinance these obligations using long-termdebt, should the put be exercised.
Anadarkos $1.750 billion 5.950% Senior Notes due September 2016 were classified as long-term debt on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December31,2015, as Anadarko intends to refinance these obligations prior to or at maturity with new long-term debt issuances or by using the $3.0 billion five -year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (Five-Year Facility).
Fair Value The Company uses a market approach to determine the fair value of its fixed-rate debt using observable market data, which results in a Level 2 fair-value measurement. The carrying amount of floating-rate debt approximates fair value as the interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates. The estimated fair value of the Companys total borrowings was $15.7 billion at December31,2015 , and $17.4 billion at December31,2014 .

Debt and Interest Expense (Continued) Anadarko Revolving Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Program In June2014, Anadarko entered into the Five -Year Facility and a $2.0billion 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility ( 364 -Day Facility). In January 2015, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, including the payment of the settlement related to the Tronox Adversary Proceeding, these facilities replaced the $5.0billion Facility. In December 2015, the Company amended the Five-Year Facility to extend the maturity date to January 2021 and in January 2016, the Company replaced the 364 -Day Facility with a new $2.0 billion 364 -day senior unsecured revolving facility on identical terms that will mature in 2017 .
Borrowings under the Five-Year Facility and the 364 -Day Facility (collectivity, the Credit Facilities) generally bear interest under one of two rate options, at Anadarkos election, using either LIBOR (or Euro Interbank Offered Rate in the case of borrowings under the Five-Year Facility denominated in Euro) or an alternate base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 1.65% for the Five-Year Facility and 0.00% to 1.675% for the 364-Day Facility. The applicable margin will vary depending on Anadarkos credit ratings.
The Credit Facilities contain certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant requiring maintenance of a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 65% (excluding the effect of non-cash write-downs), and limitations on certain secured indebtedness, sale-and-leaseback transactions, and mergers and other fundamental changes. At December31,2015 , the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facilities and was in compliance with all covenants contained therein.
In January 2015, the Company initiated a commercial paper program, which allows a maximum of $3.0billion of unsecured commercial paper notes and is supported by the Five-Year Facility. The maturities of the commercial paper notes vary, but may not exceed 397 days . The commercial paper notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are issued either at a discounted price to their principal face value or will bear interest at varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. Such discounted price or interest amounts are dependent on market conditions and the ratings assigned to the commercial paper program by credit rating agencies at the time of issuance of the commercial paper notes. At December31,2015 , the Company had $250 million of commercial paper notes outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.98% . Anadarko classified the outstanding commercial paper notes as long-term debt on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December31,2015, as the Company currently intends to refinance these obligations at maturity with additional commercial paper notes supported by the Five-Year Facility.
WES Borrowings In February 2014, WES amended and restated its then-existing $800million senior unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into a five-year, $1.2 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in February 2019 (RCF), which is expandable to a maximum of $1.5billion . Borrowings under the RCF bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.975% to 1.45% depending on WESs credit rating, or the greatest of (i) rates at a margin above the one-month LIBOR, (ii) the federal funds rate, or (iii) prime rates offered by certain designated banks. At December31,2015 , WES was in compliance with all covenants contained in itsRCF, had outstanding borrowings under its RCF of $300million at an interest rate of 1.73% , and had available borrowing capacity of approximately $894million ($1.2billion capacity, less $300 million of outstanding borrowings and $6million of outstanding letters of credit).

Also included in the 2015 ending balance are benefits of $24million related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain, but the timing of such deductibility is uncertain.
As of December31,2015 , the Company had recorded a total tax benefit of $576 million relatedto the Tronox-related contingent liability. This benefit is net of a $1.3 billion uncertain tax position due to the uncertainty related to the deductibility of the settlement payment. The Company is a participant in the U.S. Internal Revenue Services (IRS) Compliance Assurance Process for the 2015 tax year and has regular discussions with the IRS concerning the Companys tax position. Depending on the outcome of such discussions, it is reasonably possible that the amount of the uncertain tax position related to the settlement could change, perhaps materially. See Note15Contingencies Tronox Litigation .
Income tax audits and the Companys acquisition and divestiture activity have given rise to tax disputes in U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. See Note15Contingencies Other Litigation.
Over the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by $400million to $410million due to settlements with taxing authorities or lapse in statutes of limitation. The majority of the possible decrease relates to foreign tax credit amounts that would be offset with a full valuation allowance and would have no effect on the effective tax rate. With the exception of the deductibility of the Tronox settlement payment discussed above, management does not believe that the final resolution of outstanding tax audits and litigation will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Income Taxes (Continued) The Company had accrued approximately $11 million of interest related to uncertain tax positions at December31,2015 , and $9 million at December31,2014 . The Company recognized interest and penalties in income tax expense (benefit) of $2million during 2015 and $1 million during 2014 .
Anadarko is subject to audit by tax authorities in the U.S. federal, state, and local tax jurisdictions as well as in various foreign jurisdictions. The following lists the tax years subject to examination by major tax jurisdiction: TaxYears United States 2008-2015 Algeria 2012-2015 Ghana 2006-2015 13.  Asset Retirement Obligations The majority of Anadarkos AROs relate to the plugging of wells and the related abandonment of oil and gas properties. Revisionsin estimated liabilities during the period relate primarily to changes in estimates of asset retirement costs and include,but are not limited to, revisions of estimated inflation rates, changes in property lives,and the expected timing of settlement.

Commitments Operating Leases At December31,2015 , the Company had $1.8 billion in long-term drilling rig commitments that satisfy operating lease criteria. The Company also had $329 million of various commitments under non-cancelable operating lease agreements for production platforms and equipment, buildings, facilities, compressors, and aircraft. These operating leases expire at various dates through 2026 . Certain of these operating leases contain residual value guarantees at the end of the lease term, totaling $81 million at December31,2015 .
No liability has been accrued for residual value guarantees. In addition, these operating leases include options to purchase the leased property during or at the end of the lease term for the fair market value or other specified amount at that time. The following summarizes future minimum lease payments under operating leases at December31,2015 : millions 2016 $ 806 2017 604 2018 352 2019 228 2020 86 Later years 41 Total future minimum lease payments $ 2,117 Anadarko has entered into various agreements to secure drilling rigs necessary to support the execution of its drilling plans over the next several years. The table of future minimum lease payments above includes $1.7billion related to five offshore drilling vessels and $98million related to certain contracts for U.S. onshore drilling rigs. Lease payments associated with the drilling of exploratory wells and development wells net of amounts billed to partners will initially be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties, and either depreciated or impaired in future periods or written off as exploration expense.
Total rent expense, net of sublease income and amounts capitalized, amounted to $77million in 2015 , $85million in 2014 , and $119million in 2013 . Total rent expense includes contingent rent expense related to transportation and processing fees of $17million in 2015 , $22million in 2014 , and $24million in 2013 .
Other Commitments In the normal course of business, the Company enters into other contractual agreements for processing, treating, transportation, and storage of oil, natural gas, and NGLs as well as for other oil and gas activities. These agreements expire at various dates through 2036 . At December31,2015 , aggregate future payments under these contracts totaled $10.1billion , of which $1.9billion is expected to be paid in 2016 , $1.7billion in 2017 , $1.3billion in 2018 , $1.2billion in 2019 , $1.1billion in 2020 , and $2.9billion thereafter.
121 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013 15.  Contingencies Litigation The Company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits, is involved in governmental proceedings, and is subject to regulatory controls arising in the ordinary course of business, including personal injury claims; property damage claims; title disputes; tax disputes; royalty claims; contract claims; contamination claims relating to oil and gas exploration, production, transportation, and processing; and environmental claims, including claims involving assets owned by acquired companies and claims involving assets previously sold to third parties and no longer a part of the Companys current operations. The Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets include liabilities of $269million at December31,2015 , and $5.3billion at December31,2014 , for litigation-related contingencies. Anadarko is also subject to various environmental-remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state, and local laws and regulations. While the ultimate outcome and impact on the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, after consideration of recorded expense and liability accruals, management believes that the resolution of pending proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Deepwater Horizon Events In April 2010, the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico blew out and an explosion occurred on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, resulting in an oil spill. The well was operated by BP Exploration and Production Inc. (BP) and Anadarko held a 25% nonoperated interest. In October 2011, the Company and BP entered into a settlement agreement, mutual releases, and agreement to indemnify relating to the Deepwater Horizon events (Settlement Agreement), under which the Company paid $4.0 billion in cash and transferred its interest in the Macondo well and the Mississippi Canyon Block 252 (Lease) to BP. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Company is fully indemnified by BP against all claims, causes of action, losses, costs, expenses, liabilities, damages, or judgments of any kind arising out of the Deepwater Horizon events, related damage claims arising under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), claims for natural resource damages (NRD) and assessment costs, and any claims arising under the Operating Agreement with BP (OA). This indemnification is guaranteed by BP Corporation North America Inc. (BPCNA) and, in the event that the net worth of BPCNA declines below an agreed-upon amount, BP p.l.c. has agreed to become the sole guarantor. Under the Settlement Agreement, BP does not indemnify the Company against penalties and fines, punitive damages, shareholder derivative or securities laws claims, or certain other claims.
Numerous Deepwater Horizon event-related civil lawsuits have been filed against BP and other parties, including the Company by, among others, fishing, boating, and shrimping enterprises and industry groups; restaurants; commercial and residential property owners; certain rig workers or their families; the States of Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi, and several of their political subdivisions; the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ); environmental non-governmental organizations; and certain Mexican states. Many of the lawsuits filed assert various claims of negligence, gross negligence, and violations of several federal and state laws and regulations, including, among others, OPA; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act (CWA); and the Endangered Species Act; or challenge existing permits for operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Generally, the plaintiffs seek actual damages, punitive damages, declaratory judgment, and/or injunctive relief. This litigation has been consolidated into a federal Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) action pending before Judge Carl Barbier in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana in New Orleans, Louisiana (Louisiana District Court).
In July 2015, BP announced a settlement agreement in principle with the DOJ and certain states and local government entities regarding essentially all of the outstanding claims against BP related to the Deepwater Horizon event (BP Settlement) and, in October 2015, lodged a proposed consent decree with the Louisiana District Court. A hearing related to the consent decree is currently scheduled for March 2016.
122 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013 15.  Contingencies (Continued) Liability Accrual Below is a discussion of the Companys current analysis, under applicable accounting guidance, of its potential liability for (i)amounts under the OA (OA Liabilities), (ii)OPA-related environmental costs, and (iii)other contingent liabilities. Applicable accounting guidance requires the Company to accrue a liability if both (a) it is probable that a liability has been incurred and (b) the amount of that liability can be reasonably estimated.
The Company is fully indemnified by BP against OPA damage claims, NRD claims and assessment costs, and other potential liabilities. The Company may be required to recognize a liability for these amounts in advance of or in connection with recognizing a receivable from BP for the related indemnity payment. In all circumstances, however, the Company expects that any additional indemnified liability that may be recognized by the Company will be subsequently recovered from BP itself or through the guarantees of BPCNA or BPp.l.c. The Company has not recorded a liability for any costs that are subject to indemnification by BP.
OA Liabilities Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, all amounts deemed by BP to have been due under the OA, as well as all future amounts that otherwise would be invoiced to Anadarko under the OA, have been satisfied.
OPA-Related Environmental Costs BP, Anadarko, and other parties, including parties that do not own an interest in the Lease, such as the drilling contractor, have received correspondence from the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) referencing their identification as a responsible party or guarantor (RP) under OPA. Under OPA, RPs, including Anadarko, may be jointly and severally liable for costs of well control, spill response, and containment and removal of hydrocarbons as well as other costs and damage claims related to the spill and spill cleanup. The USCGs identification of Anadarko as an RP arises as a result of Anadarkos status as a co-lessee in the Lease.
Under accounting guidance applicable to environmental liabilities, a liability is presumed probable if the entity is both identified as an RP and associated with the environmental event. The Companys co-lessee status in the Lease at the time of the event and the subsequent identification and treatment of the Company as an RP satisfies these standards and therefore establishes the presumption that the Companys potential environmental liabilities related to the Deepwater Horizon events are probable.
As BP funds OPA-related environmental costs, any potential joint and several liability for these costs is satisfied for all RPs, including Anadarko. This bears significance in that once these costs are funded by BP, such costs are no longer analyzed as OPA-related environmental costs, but instead are analyzed as OA Liabilities. As discussed above, Anadarko has settled its OA Liabilities with BP. Thus, potential liability to the Company for OPA-related environmental costs can arise only where BP does not, or otherwise is unable to, fund all of the OPA-related environmental costs. Under this scenario, the joint and several nature of the liability for these costs could cause the Company to recognize a liability for OPA-related environmental costs. However, all liability relating to OPA-related environmental costs should be resolved as part of the BP Settlement, provided that the consent decree is ultimately approved by the Louisiana District Court. Additionally, in the event the consent decree is not approved by the Louisiana District Court, the Company is fully indemnified by BP against these costs (including guarantees by BPCNA or BPp.l.c.).
Allocable Share of Gross OPA-Related Environmental Costs Under applicable accounting guidance, the Company is required to estimate its allocable share of gross OPA-related environmental costs. To date, BP has paid all Deepwater Horizon event-related costs, which satisfies the Companys potential liability for these costs. Additionally, BP has entered into the BP Settlement Agreement to resolve all liability associated with these costs. Based on the BP Settlement Agreement, BPs stated intent to continue funding these costs, the Companys assessment of BPs financial ability to continue funding these costs, and the impact of BPs settlements with both of its OA partners, the Company believes the likelihood of BP not continuing to satisfy these claims to be remote. Accordingly, the Company considers zero to be its allocable share of gross OPA-related environmental costs and, consistent with applicable accounting guidance, has not recorded a liability for these amounts.
123 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013 15.  Contingencies (Continued) Penalties and Fines These costs include amounts that may be assessed as a result of potential civil and/or criminal penalties under various federal, state, and/or local statutes and/or regulations as a result of the Deepwater Horizon events, including, for example, the CWA, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and possibly other federal, state, and local laws. The foregoing does not represent an exhaustive list of statutes and regulations that potentially could trigger a penalty or fine assessment against the Company. In December2010, the DOJ on behalf of the United States, filed a civil lawsuit in the Louisiana District Court against several parties, including the Company, seeking an assessment of civil penalties under the CWA in an amount to be determined by the Louisiana District Court. In an effort to resolve this matter, the Company made a settlement offer to the DOJ in July 2014 and had a contingent liability of $90 million recorded as of December 31, 2014. After previously finding that Anadarko, as a nonoperating investor in the Macondo well, was not culpable with respect to the Deepwater Horizon events, the Louisiana District Court found Anadarko liable for civil penalties under Section311 of the CWA as a working-interest owner in the Macondo well and entered a judgment of $159.5 million in December2015.
The Company recorded an additional contingent liability during 2015 for $69.5 million , for a total liability of $159.5 million at December31,2015. The deadline for an appeal of the decision was February16,2016. The parties did not appeal the decision; accordingly, the Company expects to pay the penalty in the first quarter of 2016.
As discussed below, numerous Deepwater Horizon event-related civil lawsuits have been filed against BP and other parties, including the Company. Certain state and local governments appealed, or provided indication of a likely appeal of, the Louisiana District Courts decision that only federal law, and not state law, applies to Deepwater Horizon event-related claims. These appeals should be dismissed as part of the BP Settlement, provided that the consent decree is ultimately approved by the Louisiana District Court. In the event the consent decree is not approved by the Louisiana District Court and any such appeal proceeds and is successful, state and/or local laws and regulations could become sources of penalties or fines against the Company.
Natural Resource Damages This category includes future damage claims that may be made by federal and/or state natural resource trustee agencies at the completion of injury assessments and restoration planning. Natural resources generally include land, fish, water, air, wildlife, and other such resources belonging to, managed by, held in trust by, or otherwise controlled by, the federal, state, or local government. The NRD assessment process is led by various federal agencies and affected states. Referred to as the Co-Trustees, these entities continue to conduct injury assessment and restoration planning. NRD claims are generally sought after the damage assessment and restoration planning is completed, which may take several years. Thus, the Company remains unable to reasonably estimate the magnitude of any NRD claim. However, all NRD claims should be dismissed as part of the BP Settlement, provided that the consent decree is ultimately approved by the Louisiana District Court. In the event the Louisiana District Court does not approve the consent decree, the Company anticipates that BP will satisfy any NRD claim, which eliminates any potential liability to Anadarko for such costs. In the event any NRD damage claim is made directly against Anadarko, the Company is fully indemnified by BP against such claims (including guarantees by BPCNA or BP p.l.c.).
124 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013 15.  Contingencies (Continued) Civil Litigation Damage Claims As discussed above, numerous Deepwater Horizon event-related civil lawsuits have been filed against BP and other parties, including the Company. Generally, the plaintiffs are seeking actual damages, punitive damages, declaratory judgment, and/or injunctive relief. However, all claims relating to this MDL action should be dismissed as part of the BP Settlement, provided that the consent decree is ultimately approved by the Louisiana District Court. Additionally, in the event the consent decree is not approved by the Louisiana District Court, the Company, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, is fully indemnified by BP against losses arising as a result of claims for damages, irrespective of whether such claims are based on federal (including OPA) or state law.
Remaining Liability Outlook It is possible that the Company may recognize additional Deepwater Horizon event-related liabilities for potential penalties and fines and certain royalty claims not covered by the indemnification provisions of the Settlement Agreement.
Tronox Litigation On November 28, 2005, Tronox Incorporated (Tronox), at the time a subsidiary of Kerr-McGee Corporation, completed an initial public offering (IPO) and was subsequently spun-off from Kerr-McGee Corporation. In August 2006, Anadarko acquired all of the stock of Kerr-McGee Corporation. In January 2009, Tronox and certain of Tronoxs subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Bankruptcy Court), which is the court that presided over the Adversary Proceeding (defined below). In May 2009, Tronox and certain of its affiliates filed a lawsuit against Anadarko and Kerr-McGee Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, Kerr-McGee) asserting several claims, including claims for actual and constructive fraudulent conveyance (Adversary Proceeding). Tronox alleged, among other things, that it was insolvent or undercapitalized at the date of its IPO and sought, among other things, to recover damages in excess of $18.85 billion from Kerr-McGee and Anadarko as well as interest and attorneys fees and costs. In accordance with Tronoxs Bankruptcy Court-approved Plan of Reorganization (Plan), the Adversary Proceeding was pursued by a litigation trust (Litigation Trust). Pursuant to the Plan, the Litigation Trust was deemed substituted for the Tronox plaintiffs in the Adversary Proceeding. For purposes of this Form 10-K, references to Tronox after February2011 refer to the Litigation Trust.
The U.S. government intervened in the Adversary Proceeding, and in May 2009 asserted separate claims against Anadarko and Kerr-McGee under the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act (FDCPA Complaint). The Litigation Trust and the U.S. government agreed that the recovery of damages under the Adversary Proceeding, if any, would cover both the Adversary Proceeding and the FDCPA Complaint.
125 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013 15.  Contingencies (Continued) Liability Accrual On April 3, 2014, Anadarko and Kerr-McGee entered into a settlement agreement with the Litigation Trust and the U.S. government (in its capacity as plaintiff-intervenor and acting for and on behalf of certain U.S. government agencies) to resolve all claims asserted in the Adversary Proceeding and FDCPA Complaint for $5.15billion , which represents principal of approximately $3.98billion plus 6% interest from the filing of the Adversary Proceeding on May12,2009, through April 3, 2014. In addition, the Company agreed to pay interest on the above amount from April 3, 2014, through the payment of the settlement, with an annual interest rate of 1.5% for the first 180 days and 1.5% plus the one-month LIBOR thereafter. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the Litigation Trust, Anadarko, and Kerr-McGee agreed to mutually release all claims that were or could have been asserted in the Adversary Proceeding. The U.S. government (representing federal agencies that filed claims in the Tronox bankruptcy), Anadarko, and Kerr-McGee also provided covenants not to sue each other with respect to certain claims and causes of action. The U.S. government also provided contribution protection from third-party claims seeking reimbursement from Anadarko and certain of its affiliates for the sites identified in the settlement agreement. In January2015, the Company paid $5.2billion after the settlement agreement became effective.
Anadarko recognized Tronox-related contingent losses of $850million in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $4.3billion in the first quarter of 2014. In addition, Anadarko recognized settlement-related interest expense, included in Tronox-related contingent loss in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income, of $60million during 2014 and $5 million during the first quarter of 2015. At December 31, 2015, there was no Tronox-related contingent liability on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. For information on the tax effects of the Tronox settlement agreement, see Note12Income Taxes .
Other Litigation In December2008, Anadarko sold its interest in the Peregrino heavy-oil field offshore Brazil. The Company is currently litigating a dispute with the Brazilian tax authorities regarding the tax rate applicable to the transaction. In December 2008, the Company deposited the amount of tax originally in dispute in a Brazilian real-denominated judicially-controlled Brazilian bank account pending final resolution of the matter. At December31,2015 , the deposit of $86 million is included in other assets on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet.
In July2009, the lower judicial court ruled in favor of the Brazilian tax authorities. The Company appealed this decision to the Brazilian Regional courts, which upheld the lower courts ruling in favor of the Brazilian tax authorities in December2011. In April2012, the Company filed simultaneous appeals to the Brazilian Superior Court and the Brazilian Supreme Court. The Brazilian Superior Court and the Brazilian Supreme Court have agreed to hear the case and the Company currently is awaiting the setting of initial hearing dates.
In August 2013, following a determination by an administrative court in a related matter that the amount of tax in dispute was not calculated properly, the Company filed a petition requesting the withdrawal of a portion of the judicial deposit to the extent it exceeds the amount of tax currently in dispute and any interest on such excess amount. In April 2015, the Companys petition was denied. The Company appealed this decision. The appeal was denied in November 2015.
The Company believes that it will more likely than not prevail in the Brazilian Superior Court and the Brazilian Supreme Court. Therefore, no tax liability has been recorded for Peregrino divestiture-related litigation at December31,2015 . The Company continues to vigorously defend its position in Brazilian courts.
126 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013 15.  Contingencies (Continued) Guarantees and Indemnifications The Company provides certain indemnifications in relation to asset dispositions. These indemnifications typically relate to disputes, litigation, or tax matters existing at the date of disposition. In 2013, as a result of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy declaration by a third party, the Department of the Interior ordered Anadarko to perform the decommissioning of a production facility and related wells, which were previously sold to the third party. During 2013, the Company accrued costs of $117million to decommission the production facility and related wells, reported in other (income) expense, net in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income. During each of the years ended December31,2015 and 2014 , the Company recognized a $22 million increase in the estimated decommissioning costs. Anadarko completed decommissioning of the production facility in 2014 and expects to complete decommissioning of the wells in 2016. Decommissioning obligations of $116million at December31,2015 , and $114million at December31,2014 , were included in accrued expenses on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. Actual costs may vary from this estimate; however, the Company does not believe that any such change will materially impact its financial condition, results of operations, or cashflows.
Environmental Matters Anadarko is also subject to various environmental-remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state, and local laws and regulations. The Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets include liabilities for remediation and reclamation obligations of $145million at December31,2015 , and $126 million at December31,2014 . The current portion of these amounts was included in accounts payable and the long-term portion of these amounts was included in other long-term liabilities  other on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company continually monitors remediation and reclamation processes and adjusts its liability for these obligations as necessary.
The Company is one of numerous parties previously notified by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) that, as a result of a prior acquisition, it is a potentially responsible party with respect to a landfill located in West Covina, California. While no agreement is in place with the DTSC, the Company recorded a $50million restoration liability in 2013 with respect to the site, representing the current estimated obligation, which is included in the Companys liability balance at December31,2015. The Company could incur additional obligations if any of the potentially responsible parties are ultimately not able to fund their allocated share of the costs or if the DTSC requires a more costly remedial approach. It is possible that the Companys current estimate of probable loss related to this matter could change, perhaps materially, in the future.

Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits, and Defined-Contribution Plans The Company has contributory and non-contributory defined-benefit pension plans, which include both qualified and supplemental plans. The Company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees. Retiree health care benefits are funded by contributions from the retiree, and in certain circumstances, contributions from the Company. The Companys retiree life insurance plan is non-contributory.

Actuarial gains and losses that exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market-related value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits under each plan. In 2016 , an estimated $34 million of net actuarial loss and $27 million of net prior service credit for the pension and other postretirement plans will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost.
129 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013 16.  Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits, and Defined-Contribution Plans (Continued) Defined-benefit plan obligations and costs are actuarially determined, incorporating the use of various assumptions. Critical assumptions for pension and other postretirement plans include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (for funded pension plans), the rate of future compensation increases, and the health care cost trend rate or inflation (for postretirement plans). Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover. The Company evaluates and updates its actuarial assumptions at least annually.
Accumulated and projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of future cash payments. The Company discounts those cash payments using a discount rate that reflects the weighted average of market-observed yields for select high-quality (AA-rated) fixed-income securities with cash flows that correspond to the expected amounts and timing of benefit payments. The discount-rate assumption used by the Company represents an estimateof the interest rate at which the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date. Assumed rates of compensation increases for active participants vary by age group, with theresulting weighted-average assumed rate (weighted by the plan-level benefit obligation) provided in the precedingtable.
The following summarizes the weighted-average assumptions used by the Company in determining the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31: Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 Benefit obligation assumptions Discount rate 4.50 % 4.00 % 4.75 % 5.00 % 4.25 % 5.25 % Rates of increase in compensation levels 5.25 % 5.25 % 5.00 % 5.50 % 5.25 % 5.25 % Net periodic benefit cost assumptions Discount rate 4.00 % 4.75 % 3.50 % 4.25 % 5.25 % 4.00 % Long-term rate of return on plan assets 6.75 % 6.75 % 7.00 % N/A N/A N/A Rates of increase in compensation levels 5.25 % 5.00 % 4.50 % 5.25 % 5.25 % 4.50 % An annual rate of increase indexed to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of 1.75% was assumed for purposes of measuring the other postretirement benefit obligation at December31,2015 , due to a plan amendment effective in 2016 that changed the Companys annual benefit payments to a per-participant fixed amount, subject to annual escalation based upon CPI. An 8.00% annual rate of increase in the per-capita cost of covered health care benefits for the next year was assumed for purposes of measuring other postretirement benefit obligations at December31,2014 .

Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits, and Defined-Contribution Plans (Continued) Plan Assets Investment Policies and Strategies The Company has adopted a balanced, diversified investment strategy, with the intent of maximizing returns without exposure to undue risk. Investments are typically made through investment managers across several investment categories (domestic equity securities, international equity securities, fixed-income securities, real estate, hedge funds, and private equity), with selective exposure to Growth/Value investment styles. Performance for each investment is measured relative to the appropriate index benchmark for its category. Target asset-allocation percentages by major category are 45% - 55% equity securities, 20% - 30% fixed income, and up to 25% in a combination of other investments such as real estate, hedge funds, and private equity. Investment managers have full discretion as to investment decisions regarding funds under their management to the extent permitted within investment guidelines.
Although investment managers may, at their discretion and within investment guidelines, invest in Anadarko securities, there are no direct investments in Anadarko securities included in plan assets. There may be, however, indirect investments in Anadarko securities through the plans collective fund investments. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption was determined using the year-end 2015 pension investment balances by asset class and expected long-term asset allocation. The expected return for each asset class reflects capital-market projections formulated using a forward-looking building-block approach while also taking into account historical return trends and current market conditions. Equity returns generally reflect long-term expectations of real earnings growth, dividend yield, and inflation. Returns on fixed-income securities are generally developed based on expected inflation, real bond yield, and risk spread (as appropriate), adjusted for the expected effect that changing yields haveon the rate of return. Other asset-class returns are derived from their relationship to the equity and fixed-income markets.

Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits, and Defined-Contribution Plans (Continued) Investments in securities traded in active markets are measured based on unadjusted quoted prices, which represent Level 1 inputs. Investments based on Level 2 inputs include direct investments in corporate debt and other fixed-income securities as well as shares of open-end mutual funds or similar investment vehicles that do not have a readily determinable fair value but are valued at the net asset value per share (NAV). For such funds, the NAV is the value at which investors transact with the fund, and is determined by the fund based on the estimated fair values of the underlying fund assets. Fair value of investments included as Level 3 inputs generally also reflect investments valued at fund NAVs, but, unlike investments characteristic of Level 2 fair-value measurements, such plan assets have significant liquidity restrictions or other features that are not reflected in NAV.
The following summarizes changes in the fair value of investments based on Level 3 inputs: millions HedgeFunds and Other Alternative Strategies Private Equity RealEstate Total Balance at January 1, 2014 $ 79 $ 72 $ 86 $ 237 Acquisitions (dispositions), net 42  2 44 Actual return on plan assets Relating to assets sold during the reporting period 2 5  7 Relating to assets still held at the reporting date 3 7 6 16 Balance at December31,2014 $ 126 $ 84 $ 94 $ 304 Acquisitions (dispositions), net 1 (4 ) 2 (1 ) Actual return on plan assets Relating to assets sold during the reporting period  11  11 Relating to assets still held at the reporting date  1 8 9 Balance at December31,2015 $ 127 $ 92 $ 104 $ 323 Risks and Uncertainties The plan assets include various investment securities that are exposed to various risks such as interest-rate, credit, and market risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, it is possible that changes in the values of investment securities could significantly impact the plan assets.
The plan assets may include securities with contractual cash flows such as asset-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, and commercial mortgage-backed securities, including securities backed by subprime mortgage loans. The value, liquidity, and related income of those securities are sensitive to changes in economic conditions, including real estate values, delinquencies or defaults, or both, and may be adversely affected by shifts in the markets perception of the issuers and changes in interest rates.

Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits, and Defined-Contribution Plans (Continued) Cash Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments While reported benefit obligations exceed the fair value of pension and other postretirement plan assets at December31,2015 , the Company monitors the status of its funded pension plans to ensure that plan funds are sufficient to continue paying benefits. Contributions to funded plans increase plan assets while contributions to unfunded plans are used to fund current benefit payments.

All regular employees of the Company on its U.S. payroll are eligible to participate in the ESP by making elective contributions that are matched by the Company, subject to certain limitations. The Company recognized expense of $76 million for both 2015 and 2014 , and $78 million for 2013 , related to these plans.

Share-Based Compensation (Continued) Equity-Classified Awards Restricted Stock Certain employees may be granted restricted stock in the form of restricted stock awards or restricted stock units. Restricted stock is subject to forfeiture restrictions and cannot be sold, transferred, or disposed of during the restriction period. The holders of restricted stock awards have the same rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to such shares, including the right to vote and receive dividends or other distributions paid with respect to the shares. A restricted stock unit is equivalent to a restricted stock award except that unit holders do not have the right to vote. Restricted stock vests over service periods ranging from the date of grant generally up to three years and is not considered issued and outstanding until vested.
Non-employee directors are granted deferred shares, which are also considered restricted stock, that are held in a grantor trust by the Company until payable. Non-employee directors may receive these shares in a lump-sum payment or in annual installments.
The following summarizes the Companys restricted stock activity: Shares (millions) Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value (per share) Non-vested at January 1, 2015 3.60 $ 85.31 Granted 2.35 $ 79.40 Vested (1.76 ) $ 84.18 Forfeited (0.21 ) $ 84.34 Non-vested at December 31, 2015 3.98 $ 82.39 The weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of restricted stock granted was $87.42 during 2014 and $84.17 during 2013 . The total fair value of restricted shares vested was $141 million during 2015 , $132 million during 2014 , and $110 million during 2013 , based on the market price at the vesting date. At December31,2015 , total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock of $213 million is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining service period of 1.9 years .

Share-Based Compensation (Continued) Stock Options Certain employees may be granted nonqualified options to purchase shares of Anadarko common stock with an exercise price equal to, or greater than, the fair market value of Anadarko common stock on the date of grant. These stock options generally vest over three years from the date of grant and terminate at the earlier of the date of exercise or seven years from the date of grant.
The fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:  Expected life Based on historical exercise behavior.
Volatility Based on an average of historical volatility over the expected life of an option and the 12-month average implied volatility.
Risk-free interest rates Based on the U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life of an option.
Dividend yield Based on a 12-month average dividend yield, taking into account the Companys expected dividend policy over the expected life of an option.
Expected forfeiture Based on historical forfeiture experience.
The Company used the following weighted-average assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock options granted: 2015 2014 2013 Weighted-average grant-date fair value $ 18.18 $ 23.55 $ 26.27 Assumptions Expected option lifeyears 4.9 4.9 4.8 Volatility 32.4 % 29.9 % 33.9 % Risk-free interest rate 1.4 % 1.6 % 1.3 % Dividend yield 1.4 % 1.1 % 0.8 % The following summarizes the Companys stock option activity: Shares (millions) Weighted- Average Exercise Price (pershare) Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (millions) Outstanding at January1, 2015 6.79 $ 69.96 Granted 1.16 $ 69.37 Exercised (1) (0.66 ) $ 42.37 Forfeited or expired (0.24 ) $ 87.08 Outstanding at December31, 2015 7.05 $ 71.86 3.40 $ 13.9 Vested or expected to vest at December31, 2015 6.98 $ 71.77 3.37 $ 13.9 Exercisable at December31, 2015 5.07 $ 69.08 2.28 $ 13.9 __________________________________________________________________ (1) The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $23 million during 2015 , $88 million during 2014 , and $80 million during 2013 , based on the difference between the market price at the exercise date and the exercise price.
At December31,2015 , total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options of $38 million is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining service period of 2.2 years .

Share-Based Compensation (Continued) Liability-Classified Awards Value Creation Plan As a part of its employee compensation program, the Company offered an incentive compensation program that provided non-officer employees the opportunity to earn cash bonus awards based on the Companys TSR for the year, compared to the TSR of a predetermined group of peer companies. The Company paid $134 million during 2015 related to the plan and zero during 2014 and 2013 . The Value Creation Plan was discontinued as an active plan beginning in 2015.
Performance-Based Unit Awards Certain officers of the Company were provided Performance Unit Award Agreements with two - and three -year performance periods. The vesting of these units is based on comparing the Companys TSR to the TSR of a predetermined group of peer companies over the specified performance period. Each performance unit represents the value of one share of the Companys common stock. Following the end of each performance period, the value of the vested performance units, if any, is paid in cash. The Company paid $9 million related to vested performance units in 2015 , $12million in 2014 , and $15 million in 2013 . At December31,2015 , the Companys liability under Performance Unit Award Agreements was $16 million , with total unrecognized compensation cost related to these awards of $27 million expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining performance period of 2.4 years .

22.  Segment Information Anadarkos business segments are separately managed due to distinct operational differences and unique technology, distribution, and marketing requirements. The Companys three reporting segments are oil and gas exploration and production, midstream, and marketing. The oil and gas exploration and production segment explores for and produces oil, condensate, natural gas, and NGLs, and plans for the development and operation of the Companys LNG project in Mozambique. The midstream segment engages in gathering, processing, treating, and transporting Anadarko and third-party oil, natural-gas, and NGLs production. The midstream reporting segment consists of two operating segments, WES and other midstream, which are aggregated into one reporting segment due to similar financial andoperating characteristics. The marketing segment sells much of Anadarkos oil, natural-gas, and NGLs production, as well as third-party purchased volumes.

Segment Information (Continued) To assess the performance of Anadarkos operating segments, the chief operating decision maker analyzes Adjusted EBITDAX. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDAX as income (loss) before income taxes; gains (losses) on divestitures, net; exploration expense; DD&A; impairments; interest expense; total (gains) losses on derivatives, net, less net cash from settlement of commodity derivatives; and certain items not related to the Companys normal operations, less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. During the periods presented, items not related to the Companys normal operations included other operating expenses such as Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs and the Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement, Tronox-related contingent loss, and certain other nonoperating items included in other (income) expense, net. The Companys definition of Adjusted EBITDAX excludes gains (losses) on divestitures, net and exploration expense as they are not indicators of operating efficiency for a given reporting period. However, exploration expense is monitored by management as part of costs incurred in exploration and development activities. Similarly, DD&A and impairments are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX as a measure of segment operating performance because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. Adjusted EBITDAX also excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating results without regard to Anadarkos financing methods or capital structure. Total (gains) losses on derivatives, net, less net cash from settlement of commodity derivatives are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX because these (gains) losses are not considered a measure of asset operating performance. Finally, net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests is excluded from the Companys measure of Adjusted EBITDAX because it represents earnings that are not attributable to the Companys common stockholders.
Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX provides information useful in assessing the Companys financial condition and results of operations and that Adjusted EBITDAX is a widely accepted financial indicator of a companys ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures, and make distributions to stockholders. Adjusted EBITDAX as defined by Anadarko may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and other performance measures such as operating income or cash flows from operating activities.

Segment Information (Continued) The Companys accounting policies for individual segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies, with the following exception: certain intersegment commodity contracts may meet the GAAP definition of a derivative instrument, which would be accounted for at fair value under GAAP. However, Anadarko does not recognize any mark-to-market adjustments on such intersegment arrangements. Additionally, intersegment asset transfers are accounted for at historical cost basis, and do not give rise to gain or loss recognition.

144 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES (Unaudited) The unaudited supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 has been presented in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive ActivitiesOil and Gas and the Securities and Exchange Commissions final rule, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting . Disclosures by geographic area include the United States and International. For 2015, the International geographic area consisted of proved reserves located in Algeria and Ghana. The Company sold its Chinese subsidiary during 2014.
Oil and Gas Reserves The following reserves disclosures reflect estimates of proved reserves, proved developed reserves, and proved undeveloped reserves, net of third-party royalty interests, of oil, condensate, natural gas, and natural-gas liquids (NGLs) owned at each year end and changes in proved reserves during each of the last three years. Oil, condensate, and NGLs volumes are presented inmillions of barrels (MMBbls) and natural-gas volumes are presented inbillions of cubic feet (Bcf) at a pressure base of 14.73 pounds per square inch. Total volumes are presented inmillions of barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE). For this computation, one barrel is the equivalent of 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas. Shrinkage associated with NGLs has been deducted from the natural-gas reserves volumes.
Reserves for international locations are calculated in accordance with the terms of governing agreements. The international reserves include estimated quantities allocated to Anadarko for recovery of costs and income taxes and Anadarkos net equity share after recovery of such costs.
The Companys estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. The results of infill drilling are treated as positive revisions due to increases to expected recovery. Other revisions are due to changes in, among other things, development plans, reservoir performance, commodity prices, economic conditions, and governmental restrictions.
The prices below were used to compute the information presented in the following tables and are adjusted only for fixed and determinable amounts under provisions in existing contracts: Oil and Condensate per Bbl Natural Gas per MMBtu NGLs per Bbl (1) December31,2015 $ 50.28 $ 2.59 $ 19.47 December31,2014 $ 94.99 $ 4.35 $ 45.25 December31,2013 $ 96.78 $ 3.67 N/A __________________________________________________________________ (1) The benchmark price for NGLs was previously the same as that for oil, but was converted to a NGLs-specific price beginning in 2014.

147 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES (Unaudited) Total proved reserves decreased by 801 MMBOE in 2015 primarily due to the following:  Revisions of prior estimates Prior estimates of proved reserves were revised downward by 246 MMBOE. Negative revisions of 624 MMBOE were due to the decline in commodity prices and include a reduction to NGLs reserves of 43 MMBOE associated with price-induced ethane rejection. The negative price-related revisions were partially offset by a net increase of 378 MMBOE driven by increases from improved economics associated with performance improvements coupled with reduced year-end costs, increases from successful infill drilling mainly in the Wattenberg area of the Rocky Mountains Region (Rockies), and decreases primarily associated with updates to development plans to align with the current economic environment.
Extensions and discoveries Proved reserves increased by 29 MMBOE through the extension of proved acreage, primarily as a result of successful drilling in the Wolfcamp shale play in the Southern and Appalachia Region. Although shale plays represented only 20% of the Companys total proved reserves at December31,2015 , growth in the shale plays contributed almost all of the total extensions and discoveries.
Sales in place Proved developed reserves decreased by 238 MMBOE primarily associated with the divestiture of a portion of the Companys East Texas assets in the Southern and Appalachia Region and enhanced oil recovery and coalbed methane assets in the Rockies. Proved undeveloped reserves decreased by 41 MMBOE primarily associated with divestiture activities in the Rockies.
Total proved reserves increased by 66 MMBOE in 2014 primarily due to the following:  Revisions of prior estimates Proved reserves increased by 577MMBOE related to successful infill drilling in large onshore areas such as the Wattenberg area and the Eagleford and Haynesville shales. Partially offsetting these positive infill revisions was a net decrease of 138 MMBOE, primarily associated with the optimization of horizontal drilling locations and the discontinuation of vertical well workover plans in the Wattenberg area.
Extensions and discoveries Proved reserves increased by 63MMBOE primarily as a result of successful drilling in the Marcellus and Wolfcamp shale plays. Although shale plays represented only 17% of the Companys total proved reserves at December31,2014, growth in the shale plays contributed 49MMBOE, or 78%, of the total extensions and discoveries.
Sales in place Proved developed reserves decreased by 69 MMBOE and proved undeveloped reserves decreased by 55 MMBOE due to divestitures, including the divestiture of the Companys interest in the Pinedale/Jonah assets in Wyoming, the Companys Chinese subsidiary, and a portion of the Companys working interest in the East Texas Chalk area.
Total proved reserves increased by 232 MMBOE in 2013 primarily due to the following:  Revisions of prior estimates Proved reserves increased by 410 MMBOE related to successful infill drilling, primarily in large onshore areas such as Wattenberg, Greater Natural Buttes, and the Eagleford shale, and 30MMBOE resulting from improved oil and natural-gas prices. Partially offsetting these positive revisions were decreases of 53MMBbls of NGLs reserves due to lower ethane prices and 40MMBOE due to other non-price-related revisions primarily in the Rockies.
Extensions and discoveries Proved reserves increased by 145MMBOE as the result of successful drilling primarily in the Marcellus shale and the Gulf of Mexico. Although shale plays represented only 13% of the Companys total proved reserves at December31,2013, growth in the shale plays contributed 70MMBOE, or 48%, of the total extensions and discoveries.
Purchases in place Proved reserves increased by 36MMBOE due to acquisitions related to domestic assets almost exclusively in the Rockies.
Sales in place Proved undeveloped reserves decreased by 12 MMBOE primarily due to a partial sale of a working interest in the Gulf of Mexico Heidelberg development project.

Net revenues from production include only the revenues from the production and sale of oil, condensate, natural gas, and NGLs. Gains (losses) on property dispositions represent net gains or losses on sales of oil and gas properties. Production costs are costs to operate and maintain the Companys wells, related equipment, and supporting facilities used in oil and gas operations, including the cost of labor, well service and repair, location maintenance, power and fuel, gathering, processing, transportation, other taxes, and production-related general and administrative costs. Exploration expenses include dry hole costs, leasehold impairments, geological and geophysical expenses, and the costs of retaining unproved leaseholds. Other operating expense includes Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs and the Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement, representing the Companys resolution of the Algeria exceptional profits tax dispute with Sonatrach, which provided for the transfer of $1.7billion of oil to the Company over a 12-month period ending in mid-2013.

Estimated future net cash flows for all periods presented are reduced by estimated future development, production, and abandonment and dismantlement costs based on existing costs, assuming continuation of existing economic conditions, and by estimated future income tax expense. These estimates also include assumptions about the timing of future production of proved reserves, and timing of future development, production costs, and abandonment and dismantlement. Income tax expense, both U.S. and foreign, is calculated by applying the existing statutory tax rates, including any known future changes, to the pretax net cash flows, giving effect to any permanent differences and reduced by the applicable tax basis. The effect of tax credits is considered in determining the income tax expense. The 10% discount factor is prescribed by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
The present value of future net cash flows is not an estimate of the fair value of Anadarkos proved reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, anticipated changes in future prices and costs, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves, and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and natural gas. Significant changes in estimated reserves volumes or commodity prices could have a material effect on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
