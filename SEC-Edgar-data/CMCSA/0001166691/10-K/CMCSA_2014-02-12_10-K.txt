We seek to include in our distribution agreements the rights to offer such programming to our subscribers through multiple delivery platforms that may be used in a variety of locations, such as through On Demand, XFINITY TV online, and through our mobile apps for smartphones and tablets.
Our video programming expenses are affected by the programming license fees charged by cable networks, fees we pay for retransmission of the signals from local broadcast television stations, the number of video customers we serve and the amount of content we provide.

Filmed Entertainment Our Filmed Entertainment segment produces, acquires, markets and distributes both live-action and animated filmed entertainment worldwide. We also develop, produce and license live stage plays and own various digital media properties that are aligned with our filmed entertainment content.
We produce films both on our own and jointly with other studios or production companies, as well as with other entities. Our films are produced primarily under the Universal Pictures, Focus Features and Illumination names. Our films are marketed and distributed worldwide primarily through our own marketing and distribution companies. We also acquire distribution rights to films produced by others, which may be limited to particular geographic regions, specific forms of media or certain periods of time. Our content consists of theatrical films, direct-to-video titles and our film library, which is comprised of more than 5,000 titles in a variety of genres.
We have entered, and may continue to enter, into film cofinancing arrangements with third parties, including both studio and nonstudio entities, to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor. Investors generally assume the full risks and rewards of ownership proportionate to their ownership in the film.
11 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents The majority of our produced and acquired films are initially distributed for exhibition in movie theaters. After their release in movie theaters, we sell and license our films through various methods. We distribute our films globally by selling them in DVD format to retail stores, rental kiosks and subscription by mail services and by selling electronic copies through digital distributors and video-on-demand services provided by multichannel video providers, including our Cable Communications segment. We also license our films, including selections from our film library, to cable, broadcast and premium networks, to digital distributors, and to video-on-demand and pay-per-view services. The volume of our content that is made available through digital distributors is increasing as consumers continue to seek alternative ways to view our content.
Our Filmed Entertainment segment generates revenue primarily from the worldwide distribution of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters, the sale of our owned and acquired films in home entertainment formats, such as DVDs, and the licensing of our owned and acquired films. We also generate revenue from producing and licensing live stage plays and distributing filmed entertainment produced by third parties as well as from various digital media properties.
Theme Parks Our Theme Parks segment consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando and Hollywood. Universal Orlando includes two theme parks, Universal Studios Florida and Universals Islands of Adventure, as well as CityWalk, a dining, retail and entertainment complex. Universal Orlando also features three on-site themed hotels in which we own a noncontrolling interest. Our Universal theme park in Hollywood consists primarily of Universal Studios Hollywood. In addition, we license the right to use the Universal Studios brand name and other intellectual property, and also provide other services, to third parties that own and operate the Universal Studios Japan theme park in Osaka, Japan and the Universal Studios Singapore theme park on Sentosa Island, Singapore. We also own a water park, Wet n Wild, located in Orlando.
Our Theme Parks segment licenses the right to use a substantial amount of intellectual property from third parties for its themed elements in rides, attractions, retail outlets and merchandising.
Our Theme Parks segment generates revenue primarily from theme park attendance and per capita spending at our Universal theme parks in Orlando and Hollywood. Per capita spending includes ticket price and in-park spending on food, beverages and merchandise. We also receive fees from the third parties that own and operate Universal Studios Japan and Universal Studios Singapore for intellectual property licenses and other services.
Competition All of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, news and information products and services to consumers. Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape for all of our businesses by challenging existing business models and affecting consumer behavior.
Cable Communications Competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of direct broadcast satellite (DBS) providers, which have a national footprint and compete in all our service areas, and phone companies, which overlap approximately 45% of our service areas and are continuing to expand their fiber-based networks. These competitors offer features, pricing and packaging for cable services that are comparable to the pricing and services we offer. There also continue to be new companies, some with significant financial resources, that potentially may compete on a larger scale with our cable services. For example, companies continue to emerge that provide Internet streaming and downloading of video programming, some of which charge a Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 12 Table of Contents nominal or no fee, and Google recently launched high-speed Internet and video services in a limited number of areas. Moreover, wireless technology, such as 3G and 4G wireless broadband services and Wi-Fi networks, may compete with our video and high-speed Internet services, and our voice services are facing increased competition as a result of wireless and Internet-based phone services.
Video Services We compete with a number of different sources that provide news, sports, information and entertainment programming to consumers, including:  DBS providers that transmit satellite signals containing video programming and other information to receiving dishes located on the customers premises  phone companies that have built and continue to build fiber-optic-based networks that provide cable services similar to ours, which now overlap a substantial portion of our service areas  other providers that build and operate wireline communications systems in the same communities that we serve, including those operating as franchised cable operators  satellite master antenna television (SMATV) systems that generally serve MDUs, office complexes and residential developments We also may compete with online digital distributors that offer online services and devices that enable Internet video streaming and downloading of movies, television shows and other video programming.
In recent years, Congress has enacted legislation and the FCC has adopted regulatory policies intended to provide a favorable operating environment for existing competitors and for potential new competitors to our cable services. The FCC adopted rules favoring new investment by certain phone companies in networks capable of distributing video programming and rules allocating and auctioning spectrum for new wireless services that may compete with our video service offerings. See Legislation and Regulation below for additional information.
Direct Broadcast Satellite Providers According to recent government and industry reports, conventional medium-power and high-power satellites provide video programming to 34million subscribers in the United States. DBS providers with high-power satellites typically offer video services substantially similar to our video services. Two companies, DIRECTV and DISH Network, provide service to substantially all of these DBS subscribers. DBS providers also have marketing arrangements with certain phone companies in which the DBS providers video services are sold together with the phone companys high-speed Internet and phone services.
Phone Companies Certain phone companies, in particular AT&T, Verizon and CenturyLink, have built and are continuing to build wireline fiber-optic-based networks that provide video and high-speed Internet services in substantial portions of our service areas. These and other phone companies also may market video services provided by DBS providers in certain areas where they provide only high-speed Internet and phone services.
Other Wireline Providers Federal law prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises, and it permits franchising authorities to operate cable systems. In addition to phone companies, various other companies, including those that traditionally have not provided cable services and have significant financial resources, have obtained cable franchises and provide competing cable services. These and other cable 13 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents systems offer cable services in some areas where we hold franchises. We anticipate that facilities-based competitors may emerge in other franchise areas that we serve.
Satellite Master Antenna Television Systems Our cable services also compete for customers with SMATV systems. SMATV system operators typically are not subject to regulation in the same manner as local, franchised cable system operators. SMATV systems offer their subscribers both improved reception of local broadcast television stations and much of the programming offered by our cable systems. In addition, some SMATV system operators offer packages of video, Internet and phone services to residential and business subscribers.
Other We may also compete with newer online services from digital distributors that enable Internet video streaming and downloading of movies, television shows and other video programming and in some cases charge a nominal or no fee. Additionally, we may compete with consumer electronic companies that sell Internet-connected TVs or gaming consoles that provide their own user interface for searching TV programs and offer links to various third-party apps. The success of these newer services could negatively impact demand for our video services, including for our DVR, premium network, On Demand and streaming services.
Our cable services also may compete for customers with other companies, such as local broadcast television stations that provide multiple channels of free over-the-air programming, as well as newer services that provide programming from such broadcasts online for a fee, as well as video rental services and home entertainment products.
High-Speed Internet Services We compete with a number of companies offering Internet services, many of which have substantial resources, including:  wireline phone companies  Internet service providers  wireless phone companies and other providers of wireless Internet service  power companies  municipal broadband networks Digital subscriber line (DSL) technology allows Internet access to be provided to customers over phone lines at data transmission speeds substantially greater than those of dial-up modems. Phone companies and certain other companies offer DSL service, and several of these companies have increased data transmission speeds, lowered prices or created bundled service packages. In addition, some phone companies, such as AT&T, Verizon and CenturyLink, have built and are continuing to build fiber-optic-based networks that allow them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with DSL technology and are now offering these higher-speed services in many of our service areas. Additionally, Google recently launched high-speed Internet services in a limited number of areas.
Various wireless companies are offering Internet services using a variety of network types, including 3G and 4G wireless high-speed Internet networks and Wi-Fi networks. Some of these services are similar to ours. These networks work with devices such as wireless data cards and wireless embedded devices, such as smartphones, laptops, tablets and mobile wireless routers that connect to such embedded devices. In addition, a growing number of commercial venues, such as retail malls, restaurants and airports, offer Wi-Fi Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 14 Table of Contents service. Numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized Wi-Fi and other Internet access networks. The availability of these wireless offerings could negatively impact the demand for our high-speed Internet services.
Voice Services Our voice services compete with wireline phone companies, including incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs), wireless phone service providers and other VoIP service providers. Certain phone companies, such as the ILECs AT&T and Verizon, have substantial capital and other resources, longstanding customer relationships, and extensive existing facilities and network rights-of-way. A few CLECs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources. In addition, we are increasingly competing with wireless phone service providers as people substitute mobile phones for landline phones and with Internet-based phone services.
Business Services Our business services primarily compete with a variety of phone companies, including ILECs and CLECs. These companies either operate their own network infrastructure or rely on reselling another carriers network. We also compete with satellite operators who provide video offerings for businesses.
NBCUniversal Segments Cable Networks and Broadcast Television Our cable networks, broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for viewers attention and audience share with all forms of programming provided to viewers, including cable, broadcast and premium networks, local broadcast television stations, home entertainment, pay-per-view and video-on-demand services, online activities, such as social networking and viewing user-generated content, and other forms of entertainment, news and information. Our cable networks, broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations may compete for viewers attention with digital distributors, some of which have their own high-quality original content.
Our cable networks, broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the acquisition of programming and for on-air and creative talent with other cable and broadcast networks, local television stations and online digital distributors. The market for programming is very competitive, particularly for sports programming, where the cost for such programming is significant.
Our cable networks compete with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by multichannel video providers and online digital distributors. Our broadcast television networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the United States to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of network programming to a nationwide audience.
In addition, our cable networks and broadcast television production operations compete with other production companies and creators of content for the acquisition of story properties, creative, performing and technical personnel, and with distributors for their content and for consumer interest in their content.
Filmed Entertainment Our filmed entertainment business competes for audiences for its films and other entertainment content with other major studios and, to a lesser extent, with independent film producers, as well as with alternative forms of entertainment. Our competitive position primarily depends on the number of films we produce, their distribution and marketing success, and consumer response. Our filmed entertainment business also competes to obtain creative, performing and technical talent, including writers, actors, directors and producers, as well 15 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents as scripts for films. Our filmed entertainment business also competes with the other major studios and other producers of entertainment content for sources of financing for the production of its films, for the exhibition of its films in theaters, and for shelf space in retail stores for its DVDs and with digital distributors for the licensing and sale of its products.
Theme Parks Our theme parks business competes with other multi-park entertainment companies. We also compete with other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. In order to maintain the competitiveness of our theme parks, we have invested and continue to invest in existing and new theme park attractions and infrastructure. The investment required to introduce new attractions in our theme parks can be significant.
Advertising Our cable communications business, cable networks, broadcast television networks, and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as radio stations, print media and websites. Additionally, advertisers willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings at our cable networks, broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations. Declines in advertising revenue also can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of audiences and audience fragmentation and from the growing use of new technologies such as DVRs, which give consumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a time-delayed or on-demand basis or to fast-forward or skip advertisements within programming.
Seasonality and Cyclicality Each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Seasonality and Cyclicality for additional information.
Legislation and Regulation The Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act), and FCC regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our businesses, which are also subject to other regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities under applicable laws and regulations, as well as under agreements we enter into with franchising authorities. In addition, our businesses are subject to compliance with the terms of the FCC Order approving the NBCUniversal transaction (the NBCUniversal Order) and a consent decree entered into between us, the DOJ and five states (the NBCUniversal Consent Decree), which contain conditions and commitments of varying duration, ranging from three to seven years after September 2011. Legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules or regulations, or interpretations of existing statutes, rules or regulations, or prescribe new ones, which may significantly affect our businesses. For example, Congress is currently considering a number of legislative proposals addressing communications issues, including whether it should rewrite the entire Communications Act to account for the ever-evolving communications marketplace, whether it should reform retransmission consent and whether it should address the FCCs authority to implement open Internet regulations. We are unable to predict any such changes, or how any such changes would ultimately affect our businesses. The following paragraphs summarize material existing and potential future legal and regulatory requirements affecting our businesses, although reference should be made to the Communications Act, FCC regulations, the NBCUniversal Order, the NBCUniversal Consent Decree, and other legislation and regulations for further information.
Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 16 Table of Contents Cable Communications Segment Video Services Program Carriage The Communications Act and FCC regulations prohibit cable operators and other multichannel video providers from requiring a financial interest in, or exclusive distribution rights for, any video programming network as a condition of carriage, or from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its non-affiliation in the selection, terms or conditions for carriage. The FCC has adopted regulations that we believe increase the likelihood of program carriage complaints and is considering proposals to further expand program carriage regulations that may be disadvantageous to us. In July 2012, the FCC ruled against us in a program carriage complaint initiated by The Tennis Channel. We challenged that decision in court, and the federal courts overturned it, although The Tennis Channel is seeking further judicial review from the Supreme Court. In addition, the NBCUniversal Order prohibits discriminating against a network on the basis of its non-affiliation in the selection, terms or conditions for carriage, and requires that, if we place news and/or business news channels in a channel lineup neighborhood, we must place all independent news and business news channels in that neighborhood. Bloomberg Television filed a complaint at the FCC invoking this condition. The FCC ruled substantially in favor of Bloomberg but did not grant all of the relief Bloomberg had requested. Both Comcast and Bloomberg have challenged the FCCs ruling in court and those cases are pending. We have been involved in other program carriage disputes at the FCC and may continue to be subject to program carriage complaints in the future. Adverse decisions in disputes under the program carriage regulations or NBCUniversal Order conditions could negatively affect our business.
Must-Carry/Retransmission Consent Cable operators are currently required to carry, without compensation, the programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television stations. Alternatively, local broadcast television stations may choose to negotiate with a cable operator for retransmission consent, under which the station gives up its must-carry rights and instead seeks to negotiate a carriage agreement with the cable operator. Such an agreement may involve payments to the station. We are currently paying certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of the stations broadcast programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. For information on must-carry and retransmission consent issues relating to our broadcast television business, see NBCUniversal Segments  Broadcast Television below and refer to the Must-Carry/Retransmission Consent discussion within that section.
Pricing and Packaging The Communications Act and FCC regulations limit the prices that cable operators may charge for basic video service, equipment and installation. These rules do not apply to cable systems that the FCC determines are subject to effective competition, or where franchising authorities have chosen not to regulate rates. As a result, approximately 80% of our video services customers are not subject to rate regulation. From time to time, Congress and the FCC consider imposing new pricing or packaging regulations, including proposals that would require cable operators to offer programming networks on an a la carte or themed-tier basis instead of, or in addition to, our current packaged offerings. Additionally, uniform pricing requirements under the Communications Act may affect our ability to respond to increased competition through offers that aim to retain existing customers or regain those we have lost.
Leased Access The Communications Act requires a cable system to make available up to 15% of its channel capacity for commercial leased access by third parties to provide programming that may compete with services offered 17 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents directly by the cable operator. While we have not been required to devote significant channel capacity to leased access to date, the FCC has adopted regulations that dramatically reduce the rates we can charge for leased access channels, although their implementation has been stayed by a federal court pending the outcome of a challenge brought by us and other cable operators and also has been blocked by the Office of Management and Budget. If implemented, these regulations could adversely affect our business by significantly increasing the number of cable system channels occupied by leased access users and by significantly increasing the administrative burdens and costs associated with complying with such regulations.
Cable Equipment The FCC has adopted regulations aimed at promoting the retail sale of set-top boxes and other equipment that can be used to receive digital video services. With the exception of certain one-way devices, like digital transport adapters, these regulations prohibit cable operators from deploying new set-top boxes that perform both channel navigation and security functions. As a result, most set-top boxes that we purchase must rely on a separate security device known as a CableCARD. In addition, the FCC has adopted regulations aimed at promoting the manufacture of plug-and-play TV sets and other equipment that can connect directly to a cable system with a CableCARD and receive one-way video services without the need for a set-top box. The regulations also require cable operators to provide a credit to customers who use plug-and-play equipment purchased at retail and to allow them to self-install CableCARDs rather than having to arrange for professional installation. A federal court vacated some of these CableCARD rules in a decision in January 2013. The FCC has sought comment on an equipment manufacturers proposal that the FCC readopt these rules, and also has received requests that it supplant CableCARDs with another technology that would enable retail video devices to work on any multichannel video provider system, not just a cable system. We are unable to predict what, if any, proposals might be adopted or what effect they might have on our cable business.
In December 2013, we, other multichannel video providers, equipment manufacturers and other entities announced a voluntary agreement taking steps to improve the energy efficiency of set-top boxes. In response, the Department of Energy terminated a rulemaking it had initiated in this area. However, proposals to impose energy efficiency requirements on set-top boxes and network equipment continue to be considered at the state level and we cannot predict what, if any, proposals might be adopted in the future. In addition, the NBCUniversal Order requires us to fulfill commitments designed to improve the parental control tools and information available to parents, including providing navigation and blocking capabilities for certain set-top boxes.
MDUs and Inside Wiring FCC regulations prohibit exclusive video service access agreements between cable operators and MDUs or other private residential real estate developments, as well as our enforcement of exclusivity provisions in any of our pre-existing access agreements. FCC regulations also facilitate competitors access to the cable wiring inside such properties.
Pole Attachments The Communications Act permits the FCC to regulate the rates that pole-owning utility companies (with the exception of municipal utilities and rural cooperatives) charge cable systems for attachments to their poles. States are permitted to preempt FCC jurisdiction and regulate the terms of attachments themselves, and many states in which we operate have done so. Most of these states have generally followed the FCCs pole attachment rate standards. Until recently, the pole attachment rates applicable to telecommunications services were significantly higher than the rates we currently pay for cable and other services. In February 2013, a federal court upheld the FCCs pole rate formula that reduces the rates for telecommunications service pole attachments to levels that are at or near the rates for cable attachments, but utility companies are able to rebut certain presumptions in the new formula, and it is expected that most will attempt to do so.
Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 18 Table of Contents Vertical Ownership Limit The FCC is assessing whether to revise a limit on the number of affiliated programming channels that a cable operator may carry on a cable system. The FCCs previous limit of 40% of the first 75 channels carried on a cable system was struck down by a federal appellate court in 2001, although the FCC continues to enforce it. The FCC previously clarified that, under the 40% limit, cable systems with 75 or more channels must carry at least 45 unaffiliated channels. Our cable systems routinely carry more than 45 unaffiliated channels, and we currently comply with the 40% limit. Compliance could become more difficult depending on what regulations, if any, the FCC adopts.
Franchising Cable operators generally operate their cable systems under nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities. While the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, franchises typically last for a fixed term, obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality, customer service and other requirements, and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions. The Communications Act permits franchising authorities to establish reasonable requirements for public, educational and governmental access (PEG) programming, and some of our franchises require substantial channel capacity and financial support for this programming. The NBCUniversal Order contains various PEG-related conditions, including a requirement that we do not migrate PEG channels to digital delivery on our cable system until the system has converted to all-digital distribution or until the government entity that is responsible for the systems PEG operations expressly agrees. The Communications Act also contains provisions governing the franchising process, including, among other things, renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal. We believe that our franchise renewal prospects are generally favorable.
FCC regulations establish franchising processes and obligations for new entrants that are different from those applicable to existing providers. For example, these regulations limit the range of financial, construction and other commitments that franchising authorities can request of new entrants and preempt certain local level playing field franchising requirements. In addition, approximately half of the states in which we operate have enacted legislation to provide statewide franchising or to simplify local franchising requirements for new entrants. Some of these statutes also allow new entrants to operate on more favorable terms than our current operations, for instance by not requiring that the new entrant provide service to all parts of the franchise area or permitting the new entrant to designate only those portions it wishes to serve. Certain of these statutes allow incumbent cable operators to opt into the new state franchise immediately or later when a competing state franchise has been issued for the incumbent cable operators franchise area. However, even in those states, the incumbent cable operators often are required to retain certain franchise obligations that are more burdensome than the new entrants state franchise.
Copyright Regulation In exchange for filing reports and contributing a percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool, cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material contained in broadcast signals. The possible modification or elimination of this copyright license is the subject of ongoing legislative and administrative review. The Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010 (STELA), which expires in 2014, made several revisions to the cable operators compulsory copyright license, including clarifying that cable operators must pay additional royalty fees for each digital multicast programming stream from an out-of market broadcast station they retransmit that does not duplicate the content of the stations primary stream. It also establishes an audit mechanism for copyright owners to review a cable operators copyright royalty reporting practices, which the Copyright Office is now in the process of implementing. Extension of STELA will be an issue that Congress addresses in 2014. As required by STELA, the Copyright Office, the GAO and the FCC all issued reports to Congress in 2011 that generally supported an eventual phaseout of the compulsory licenses, although they also acknowledged the potential adverse impact on cable 19 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents and satellite subscribers and the absence of any clear marketplace alternative to the compulsory licenses. If adopted, a phaseout plan could adversely affect our ability to obtain broadcast station programming and substantially increase our programming costs.
High-Speed Internet Services We provide high-speed Internet services over our cable distribution system. In 2002, the FCC ruled that high-speed Internet services such as ours are interstate information services that are not subject to regulation as a telecommunications service under federal law or to state or local utility regulation. However, our high-speed Internet services are subject to a number of regulatory obligations, including compliance with the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) requirement that high-speed Internet service providers implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity.
In 2010, the FCC adopted open Internet regulations applicable to broadband Internet service providers (ISPs). The regulations required broadband ISPs such as us to disclose information regarding network management, performance and commercial terms of the service (the transparency rule); barred broadband ISPs from blocking access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; and barred wireline broadband ISPs such as us from unreasonably discriminating in transmitting lawful network traffic. The no-blocking and non-discrimination requirements allowed for reasonable network management. The FCC did not prohibit speed tiers or usage-based pricing, but specifically noted that paid prioritization (i.e., charging content, application and service providers for prioritizing their traffic over our last-mile facilities) or an ISPs prioritizing of its own Internet content likely would violate these regulations. In January 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated all of the FCCs rules except for the transparency rule but the court clarified that the FCC had the fundamental authority to regulate broadband Internet access services as a general matter. Nevertheless, Comcast remains bound by the FCCs original open Internet regulations as a condition of the NBCUniversal Order and the NBCUniversal Consent Decree for the remainder of the term of those orders. The requirements apply to any broadband Internet access service that we provide, to consumers regardless of whether it is accessed through a set-top box, gaming console, computer or other device. It is possible that the FCC may seek to adopt new Internet regulations or take other actions that restrict the manner in which we and other ISPs provide Internet services. The FCC also may attempt to reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service, which would authorize the FCC to subject it to traditional common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. Under a Title II framework, the FCC could potentially regulate our customer rates for broadband Internet services and could prohibit or seriously restrict arrangements between us and Internet content, application, and service providers, including backbone connection arrangements. The FCC might also take a broader view of its existing authority, as confirmed by the court decision, to adopt any regulation that conceivably would promote broadband deployment and adoption so long as it is not a common carrier regulation, and states may also attempt to regulate the Internet pursuant to the courts decision.
The NBCUniversal Order and NBCUniversal Consent Decree also include various conditions and commitments requiring us to expand our broadband service areas, to continue to offer all of our high-speed Internet service speed tiers on a stand-alone basis at reasonable market-based prices, to offer a new stand-alone 6 Mbps downstream tier (known as the performance starter tier) for $49.95 per month for three years, to maintain a high-speed Internet service of at least 12 Mbps downstream across most of our footprint, and to not discriminate in how we treat specialized services (defined as services we provide over the same last-mile facilities as our high-speed Internet service, but not including our high-speed Internet service, video services or voice services). We have taken a number of steps to comply with these conditions. In 2012, after an FCC inquiry into whether we failed to comply with the stand-alone broadband condition, we entered into a consent decree with the FCC to extend our offering of the performance starter tier for one additional year until Febru- Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 20 Table of Contents ary 2015 and to reinforce the promotion of our stand-alone broadband offerings, including training our sales representatives with respect to these offerings.
A federal program known as the Universal Service program generally requires telecommunications service providers to pay a fee based on revenue from their services into a fund used to subsidize the provision of telecommunications services in high-cost areas and to low-income consumers and the provision of Internet and telecommunications services to schools, libraries and certain health care providers. The FCC issued an order in November 2011 that changed the way that a majority of Universal Service funds are allocated and began implementing that order in 2012. By focusing on broadband and wireless deployment, and moving away from supporting traditional telephone service, the changes could assist some of our competitors in more effectively competing with our service offerings, while others could receive less funding. The actual impact of the changes is not yet known. The FCCs ruling is under review in federal court.
In addition, in November 2011, the FCC initiated a further rulemaking on IP interconnection issues that may have an impact on Internet interconnection arrangements. We have a number of peering and transit arrangements with other network operators, and these arrangements historically have not been regulated by the FCC. The FCC Chairman, however, has stressed that the FCC has a responsibility to ensure connectivity of the Internet and although he has made clear that he does not consider peering and transit arrangements to be an open Internet issue, he considers it a related issue that the FCC, at a minimum, should monitor. We cannot predict what, if any, proposals might be adopted or what effect they might have on our business.
In addition, Congress and federal regulators have adopted a wide range of measures affecting Internet use, including, for example, consumer privacy, consumer protection, copyright protection, defamation liability, taxation, obscenity and unsolicited commercial email. For example, in 1998, the Internet Tax Freedom Act was enacted in an effort to promote use of the Internet, and it has been extended three times, but is scheduled to expire on November1, 2014, unless it is extended again. State and local governments also have adopted Internet-related regulations. Furthermore, Congress, the FCC, and certain state and local governments are considering proposals to impose customer service, quality of service, expanded copyright protection requirements, taxation, child safety, privacy and standard pricing regulations on high-speed Internet service providers. It is uncertain whether any of these proposals will be adopted. The adoption of new laws or the application of existing laws to the Internet could have a material adverse effect on our high-speed Internet business.
Voice Services We provide voice services by using interconnected VoIP technology. The FCC has adopted a number of regulations for providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours, including regulations relating to customer proprietary network information, local number portability duties and benefits, disability access, E911, law enforcement assistance (CALEA), outage reporting, rural call completion reporting, Universal Service Fund contribution obligations, domestic discontinuance requirements and certain regulatory filing requirements. The FCC has not yet ruled on whether interconnected VoIP service should be classified as an information service or a telecommunications service under the Communications Act. The classification determination is important because telecommunications services are still regulated more pervasively than information services. The regulatory environment for our voice services therefore remains uncertain at both the federal and the state levels. Until the FCC definitively classifies interconnected VoIP service, state regulatory commissions and legislatures may continue to investigate imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services. For example, in Vermont, following a court remand faulting the state commission for failing to consider certain arguments in finding that our voice services are telephone services subject to state regulation, the state commission is continuing a proceeding into how to classify our voice services. A number of states have enacted laws that preclude state public utility regulation of VoIP-based services notwithstanding how they are classified under federal law.
21 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents Because the FCC has not determined the appropriate classification of our voice services, the precise scope of interconnection regulations applicable to us as a provider of nontraditional voice services is not clear. In light of this uncertainty, providers of nontraditional voice services typically either secure CLEC authorization or obtain interconnection to traditional wireline phone company networks by contracting with an existing CLEC, whose right, as a telecommunications carrier, to request and obtain interconnection with the traditional wireline phone companies is set forth in the Communications Act. We have arranged for such interconnection rights through our affiliated CLECs. While some traditional wireline phone companies have challenged our right to interconnect directly with them, we have prevailed in all of these challenges, and no such challenges are currently pending. However, if a regulatory or judicial authority were to deny our ability to interconnect through one of our CLECs, our ability to provide voice services and compete in the area in question would be negatively impacted. In December 2012, the FCC sought comment on two petitions that raise issues concerning the interconnection obligations for IP voice providers, and it also formed a task force to coordinate the FCCs efforts on issues related to the transition of networks from circuit-switched to packet-switched technology, including the issue of IP interconnection; the FCC has refocused on these issues and has suggested that progress should be expected in 2014. We cannot predict what, if any, proposals might be adopted or what effect they might have on our business. Further, a Massachusetts state commission is reviewing whether IP interconnection agreements should be subject to regulation and other states could follow. In November 2011, the FCC issued an order clarifying the entire intercarrier compensation system, which governs the arrangements by which telecommunications carriers compensate one another for exchanged traffic, whether it be for local, intrastate or interstate traffic, or VoIP. The FCC order affirmed the right of CLECs to collect intercarrier compensation when providing interconnection for VoIP providers; however, that order is currently under appeal in federal court.
Other Cable Services Regulations State and Local Taxes Some states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional taxes or fees on the cable services we offer, or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes or fees are computed. These include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes, central assessments for property tax, and taxes and fees on video, high-speed Internet and voice services. We and other cable industry members are challenging certain of these taxes through administrative and court proceedings. In addition, in some situations our DBS competitors and other competitors that deliver their services over a high-speed Internet connection do not face similar state tax and fee burdens. Congress has also considered, and may consider again, proposals to bar states from imposing taxes on DBS providers that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay.
NBCUniversal Segments Cable Networks Program Access The Communications Act and FCC regulations generally prevent cable networks affiliated with cable operators, other than terrestrially delivered programming networks, from favoring affiliated cable operators over competing multichannel video providers, such as DBS providers and phone companies that offer multichannel video programming services. In addition, the Communications Act and FCC regulations had limited the ability of cable-affiliated cable networks to offer exclusive programming contracts to a cable operator. In October 2012, the FCC allowed a preemptive restriction on exclusive contracts to expire but reaffirmed that any such exclusive contract could be reviewed on a case-by-case basis in response to a complaint alleging violation of the Communications Acts prohibition against unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices that hinder significantly or prevent competitors from providing programming to customers. In addition, the FCC Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 22 Table of Contents is considering proposals to establish presumptions that would make it easier for multichannel video providers to succeed with complaints involving exclusive contracts and to make it easier for them to use buying groups and for such buying groups to pursue complaints under the rules. It is uncertain whether the FCC will act on these proposals and, if adopted, what impact these proposals would have on our cable networks.
The FCC launched a rulemaking in 2007 to consider whether companies that own multiple cable networks should be required to make each of their networks available to multichannel video providers on a stand-alone or unbundled basis when negotiating distribution agreements, although it has not further acted on that rulemaking. We currently offer our cable networks both on a bundled and, when requested, on a stand-alone basis. Increased regulatory requirements imposed on the manner in which we negotiate programming distribution agreements with multichannel video providers may adversely affect our cable networks business. In addition, various legislative proposals have been introduced in Congress that, if ever enacted, would mandate that programmers offer cable networks to multichannel video providers on an a la carte basis and would provide certain program-access rights and protections to online video distributors. It is uncertain whether any of these proposals will ever be adopted and, if adopted, what impact these proposals would have on our cable networks.
Under the terms of the NBCUniversal Order, multichannel video providers can invoke commercial arbitration for program access in certain circumstances against our cable networks and broadcast television networks, including our regional sports networks. In addition, under the NBCUniversal Order and NBCUniversal Consent Decree, we are required to make certain of our cable network, broadcast television and filmed entertainment programming available to bona fide online video distributors in certain circumstances, and they may invoke commercial arbitration pursuant to conditions adopted in the NBCUniversal Order and NBCUniversal Consent Decree to resolve disputes regarding the availability of, and the price, terms and conditions of access to, such programming. For further discussion of these conditions, see Broadcast Television below and refer to the Must-Carry/Retransmission Consent and Internet Distribution discussions within that section.
Childrens Programming The Childrens Television Act (CTA) and FCC regulations limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown on cable networks, broadcast networks and broadcast television stations during programming originally produced and broadcast primarily for an audience of children under 13 years of age. FCC regulations also limit the display during childrens programming on cable or broadcast of Internet addresses of websites that contain or link to commercial material or that use program characters to sell products. Similarly, FCC regulations prohibit the display of commercials during childrens programming on cable or broadcast networks that use program characters to sell products when the commercial is adjacent to childrens programming in which the characters appear. The FCC is currently considering whether to prohibit interactive advertising during childrens television programming. The NBCUniversal Order includes certain commitments and conditions related to childrens television and advertising directed at children, including commitments that we will not insert interactive advertising into childrens television programming in any of the advertising spots we control, either as a multichannel video provider or as the programmer, and that we will provide at least $15 million worth of public service announcements on childhood obesity, FDA nutritional guidelines, digital literacy and parental controls per year until 2016.
Broadcast Television Licensing The Communications Act permits the operation of local broadcast television stations only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of the license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. The FCC grants broadcast television station licenses for specific periods of time and, upon application, may renew the licenses for additional terms. Under the Communications Act, broadcast 23 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents television licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years. Generally, the FCC renews broadcast licenses upon finding that the television station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC regulations; and there have been no violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC regulations, which, taken together, indicate a pattern of abuse.
In addition, CTA and FCC regulations require that the FCC consider in its review of broadcast television station license renewals whether the station has served the educational and informational (E/I) needs of children. Under the FCCs regulations, a station licensee will be deemed to have met its obligation to serve the E/I needs of children if it has broadcast on its main program stream a minimum of three hours per week of programming that has a significant purpose of serving the E/I needs of children under 17 years of age. For broadcast television stations that multicast, FCC regulations include a similar standard whereby the amount of E/I programming deemed to meet the stations E/I obligation increases in proportion to the amount of free multicast programming aired. Under the NBCUniversal Order, we have committed to provide an additional hour of E/I programming per week on either the primary or multicast streams of our owned NBC local broadcast television stations and on the primary signal of our owned Telemundo local broadcast television stations. The FCC is considering whether the requirements for E/I programming have been effective in promoting the availability of educational content for children on broadcast television, and there can be no assurance that the FCC will not impose more stringent requirements.
Under the NBCUniversal Order, we have committed to expand local news and information programming on our owned local television stations and to enter into cooperative arrangements with locally focused nonprofit news organizations in certain markets. We have met all of these commitments.
Renewal applications are pending for a number of our broadcast television station licenses. The FCC may grant any license renewal application with or without conditions, including renewal for a lesser term than the maximum otherwise permitted. A stations authority to operate is automatically extended while a renewal application is on file and under review. Four pending applications have been formally opposed by third parties and other applications are pending due to unresolved complaints of alleged indecency in the stations programming. The Communications Act also requires prior FCC approval for any sale of a broadcast station license, whether through the assignment of the license and related assets from one company to another or the transfer of control of the stock or other equity of a company holding an FCC license. Third parties may oppose such applications. The FCC may decline to renew or approve the transfer of a license in certain circumstances. Although we have received such renewals and approvals in the past, there can be no assurance that we will always obtain necessary renewals or that approvals in the future will contain acceptable FCC license conditions.
Ownership Limits FCC regulations limit the ability of individuals and entities to have attributable interests above specific levels in local television stations, as well as other specified mass media entities, such as limits on the cross-ownership of broadcast stations and newspapers in the same market. The FCC, by law, must review the ownership regulations detailed below once every four years. The current review, which officially opened in 2010, led to proposals in December 2011 (2011 Media Ownership Notice) for relaxing some limits, but retaining others. The FCC has not yet adopted an order in the 2010 proceeding, although the Communications Act requires that the agency launch its next ownership review proceeding in 2014. We cannot predict when the FCCs current review will be completed or whether or how any of these regulations will change.
Local Television Ownership Under the FCCs local television ownership rule, a licensee may own up to two broadcast television stations in the same DMA, as long as at least one of the two stations is not among the top four-ranked stations in the Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 24 Table of Contents market based on audience share as of the date an application for approval of an acquisition is filed with the FCC and at least eight independently owned and operating full-power broadcast television stations remain in the market following the acquisition. Further, without regard to the number of remaining independently owned television stations, the rule permits the ownership of more than one television station within the same DMA so long as certain signal contours of the stations involved do not overlap. The 2011 Media Ownership Notice proposes minor modifications to the local television ownership rule. It also raises questions regarding whether local news-sharing agreements, shared services agreements, and joint sales agreements that involve the right to jointly negotiate retransmission consent should count toward the FCCs ownership limitations. The stations owned by the NBC network or the Telemundo network, however, do not have agreements that involve the right to jointly negotiate retransmission consent.
National Television Ownership The Communications Act and FCC regulations limit the number of television stations one entity may own or control nationally. Under the rule, no entity may have an attributable interest in broadcast television stations that reach, in the aggregate, more than 39% of all U.S. television households. Our owned local television station reach does not exceed this limit. In September 2013, the FCC launched a rulemaking that considers eliminating a rule that currently affords UHF stations (channels 14 and above) a 50% discount in calculating the extent of an individual station owners holdings under the national cap. Adoption of this proposed change would place us closer to the national cap and limit our flexibility to acquire stations in the future.
Foreign Ownership The Communications Act generally limits foreign ownership in a broadcast station to 20% direct ownership and 25% indirect ownership (i.e., through one or more subsidiaries), although the limit on indirect ownership can be waived if the FCC finds it to be in the public interest. These limits have been held to apply to both voting control and equity, as well as to ownership by any form of entity, including corporations, partnerships and limited liability companies. For many decades the FCC has declined to waive the 25% indirect limit in broadcast transactions, but in a November 2013 declaratory ruling, the FCC stated that it is now willing to consider such waiver requests.
Dual Network Rule The dual network rule prohibits any of the four major broadcast television networks, ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC, from being under common ownership or control with another of the four.
Must-Carry/Retransmission Consent Every three years, each commercial television station must elect for each cable system in its DMA either must-carry or retransmission consent. Federal law and FCC regulations also establish a must-carry/retransmission consent election system for carriage of commercial television stations by satellite providers. For the period beginning on January1, 2012 and ending on December31, 2014, all of our NBC network and Telemundo network owned local television stations, except for certain Telemundo local television stations acquired in 2013, elected retransmission consent.
In enacting STELA in 2010, Congress modified certain aspects of the compulsory copyright licenses under which satellite providers and cable operators retransmit broadcast stations. STELA expressly extended to January1, 2015 an existing prohibition against commercial television stations entering into exclusive retransmission consent agreements with multichannel video providers and also extended a requirement that commercial television stations and multichannel video providers negotiate retransmission consent agreements in good faith. Several other multichannel video providers and third parties filed a petition asking the FCC to initiate a rulemaking to consider changes to the current retransmission consent regulations and also asked Congress to review the issue. The FCC launched a rulemaking in 2011 that, among other things, seeks comment on proposals to modify the good faith negotiating standard and to eliminate regulations providing 25 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents local television stations with exclusivity protections in their markets for network and syndicated programming. Legislation has been introduced that would eliminate both must-carry and retransmission consent as well as more narrow legislation that would aim to resolve impasses in retransmission consent negotiations. We cannot predict what new laws or regulations, if any, may be adopted or how any such laws or regulations would affect our businesses. Multichannel video providers may also invoke commercial arbitration under rules established in the NBCUniversal Order to resolve disputes regarding carriage of our owned local broadcast television stations.
Internet Distribution Under the NBCUniversal Order and NBCUniversal Consent Decree, we are required to make certain of our cable network, broadcast television and filmed entertainment programming available to bona fide online video distributors in certain circumstances, and they may invoke commercial arbitration to resolve disputes regarding the availability, and the price, terms and conditions of access to such programming. In addition, we are required to continue distributing programming via nbc.com that is generally equivalent to the programming that we distributed via nbc.com as of January1, 2011, on generally equivalent price, terms and conditions, so long as at least one of the other major broadcast networks continues to distribute its programming in a similar fashion. We are one of three broadcast network owners of Hulu, but we were required to relinquish all voting rights and our board seat in Hulu in connection with the NBCUniversal transaction. In compliance with our obligations under the NBCUniversal Order and the NBCUniversal Consent Decree, we have entered into renewal license agreements with Hulu on substantially the same terms as its other broadcast network owners.
Broadcast Spectrum In February 2012, Congress authorized the FCC to conduct an incentive auction to reassign a portion of the broadcast spectrum for mobile broadband use. Under the statute, broadcasters may voluntarily relinquish some or all of their spectrum rights in exchange for a share of the proceeds of the FCCs auction of the spectrum to mobile broadband providers. Broadcasters that do not voluntarily relinquish their spectrum rights may still be affected as part of the process of clearing and repacking the spectrum for future mobile use, but Congress required the FCC to make all reasonable efforts to preserve broadcasters over-the-air coverage area and population served, and to reimburse those broadcasters reasonable costs. The FCC currently is conducting a proceeding to implement this statute, including establishing processes for how the spectrum will be repacked and how the broadcasters will be reimbursed for relocation costs. We cannot predict whether or how any such regulations might affect our businesses.
Indecency A federal statute and FCC regulations prohibit the broadcast of obscene material on television stations at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Broadcasters risk violating this prohibition because the vagueness of the relevant FCC definitions makes it difficult to apply. Moreover, the FCC has in some instances imposed separate fines for each allegedly indecent utterance, in contrast with its previous policy that had generally considered all indecent words or phrases within a given program as constituting a single violation. The maximum penalty for broadcasting indecent or profane programming is $350,000 per indecent or profane utterance.
Indecency regulation has been the subject of recent court review, regarding both the FCCs fleeting expletives policy and the FCCs definition of what constitutes indecent material. In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the FCCs assessment of indecency fines against ABC and FOX on the grounds that the agency failed to provide fair notice of its standards and enforcement policy. However, the court declined to rule on the constitutionality of the FCCs indecency policy under the First Amendment. This ruling may result in the FCCs clarification of its policy and changes to how it approaches future indecency-related enforcement actions. In this regard, in April 2013, the FCC sought public comment regarding its indecency Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 26 Table of Contents enforcement policies. From time to time, we have received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the FCC prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on our owned local television stations included indecent or profane material. Increased content regulation, particularly if it is vague and difficult to apply, could have an adverse effect on our broadcast television business.
Sponsorship Identification Federal legislation and FCC regulations provide that whenever a broadcast station transmits any programming for which it has received money, service or other valuable consideration, it must provide an accurate on-air identification of the sponsor of the programming. Similar rules apply to cable operators in origination cablecasting (e.g., local origination programming). In 2008, the FCC commenced a proceeding to examine whether embedded advertising, such as product placements and product integration, in broadcast programming should be subject to stricter disclosure requirements and whether the sponsorship identification regulations should be extended to cable networks, although the FCC has taken no action to date.
International Regulation International regulation of television broadcasting varies widely according to jurisdiction and includes the regulation of programming and advertising. For example, the European Union (E.U.) establishes minimum levels of regulation across all E.U. member states focused on content and advertising, which also extends to nonlinear television services, although E.U. countries are free to impose stricter regulation in certain areas.
Filmed Entertainment Our filmed entertainment business is subject to the provisions of trade practice laws in effect in 25 states and Puerto Rico relating to theatrical distribution of motion pictures. These laws substantially restrict the licensing of motion pictures unless theater owners are first invited to attend a screening of the motion pictures and, in certain instances, also prohibit payment of advances and guarantees to motion picture distributors by exhibitors. Further, under various consent judgments, federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair competition laws, motion picture companies are subject to certain restrictions on trade practices in the United States, including a requirement to offer motion pictures for exhibition to theaters on a theater-by-theater basis. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has called for stronger industry safeguards applicable to the marketing of violent movies to children.
In countries outside the United States, there are a variety of existing or contemplated governmental laws and regulations that may affect our ability to distribute and license motion picture and television products, as well as consumer merchandise products, including film screen quotas, television quotas, regulation of content, regulated contract terms, product safety and labeling requirements, discriminatory taxes and other discriminatory treatment of U.S. products. The ability of countries to deny market access or refuse national treatment to products originating outside their territories is regulated under various international agreements.
Theme Parks Our theme parks are subject to various regulations, including laws and regulations regarding environmental protection, privacy and data protection, consumer product safety and theme park operations, such as health, sanitation, safety and fire standards and liquor licenses.
Other Areas of Regulation Intellectual Property Copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and Internet/domain laws of the United States and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights. In particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution of counterfeit DVDs, peer-to-peer file sharing and other platforms presents challenges for our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses. The 27 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents unauthorized reproduction, distribution or display of copyrighted material over the Internet or through other methods of distribution, such as through devices, software or websites that allow the reproduction, viewing, sharing and/or downloading of content by either ignoring or interfering with the contents security features and copyrighted status, interferes with the market for copyrighted works and disrupts our ability to exploit our content. The extent of copyright protection and the use of technological protections, such as encryption, are controversial. Modifications to existing laws that weaken these protections could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming.
While many legal protections exist to combat piracy, laws in the United States and internationally continue to evolve, as do technologies used to evade these laws. We have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content. The repeal of laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property or weakening of such laws or enforcement in the United States or internationally, or a failure of existing laws to adapt to new technologies, could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could negatively impact their value and further increase the costs of enforcing our rights.
Copyright laws also require that we pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we distribute, such as local advertising and local origination programming on our cable systems, as well as in the content we create. The fees we pay to music performance rights organizations are typically renegotiated when we renew licenses with those organizations, and we cannot predict with certainty what those fees will be in the future or if disputes will arise over them.
There is ongoing litigation related to a number of online entities that stream our broadcast television content online without the consent of, or compensation to, NBC or its affiliates, and the U.S. Supreme Court has granted certiorari to hear the broadcasting industrys challenge to one such entity. We also have brought a suit against a multichannel video provider to challenge the commercial-skipping functionality in its DVR. None of this litigation is final, and the courts have reached different decisions to date. Additionally, there is a pending legislative proposal in the United States that seems intended to legitimize some of these practices. There can be no assurance as to whether the courts will ultimately determine that these practices are unlawful or that the pending legislation will be enacted or how any such rulings or legislation would ultimately affect our businesses.
Privacy and Security Regulation The Communications Act generally restricts the nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers personally identifiable information by cable operators. There are exceptions that permit such collection and disclosure for rendering service, conducting legitimate business activities related to the service, and responding to legal requests. The Communications Act and FCC regulations also provide privacy protections for customer proprietary network information related to our voice services. Several states and numerous local jurisdictions have enacted privacy laws or franchise privacy provisions that apply to cable services.
The FTC has continued to exercise authority over privacy protections generally, using its existing authority over unfair and deceptive practices and other public proceedings to apply greater restrictions on the collection and use of personally identifiable and other information relating to consumers. It also has undertaken numerous enforcement actions against parties that do not provide sufficient security protections against the loss or disclosure of this type of information. In July 2013, FTC regulations implementing the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) went into effect. COPPA imposes requirements on website operators and online services that are aimed at children under 13 years of age, or that collect personal information or knowingly post personal information from children under 13 years of age. The FTC rules impose some significant new obligations on operators of websites and online services, including expanded categories of Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 28 Table of Contents personal information and new data security and data retention requirements, and also expand the scope of COPPA to reach third-party service providers that knowingly collect personal information through a child-directed website or service.
We are also subject to state and federal regulations and laws regarding information security. Most of these regulations and laws apply to customer information that could be used to commit identity theft. Substantially all of the U.S. states and the District of Columbia have enacted security breach notification laws. These laws generally require that a business give notice to its customers whose financial account information has been disclosed because of a security breach. In addition, we maintain an identity theft program that incorporates the guidance provided under the FTCs red flag rules, which are designed to detect the warning signs of identity theft. The FTC and state attorneys general also have initiated efforts to increase and enforce transparency requirements about the collection and use of consumer information, even in de-identified form. These requirements may require ongoing review of new and rapidly evolving technologies and methods for delivering content and advertising to ensure that appropriate notice is given to consumers and consent is obtained where required.
In February 2013, the President directed the National Institute of Standards and Technology, in cooperation with other federal agencies and owners and operators of U.S. critical infrastructure to develop a voluntary framework that provides a prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance-based, and cost-effective approach to cyber risk, which was released in February 2014. It is a compendium of existing, cross-sector cyber defense processes, practices, and protocols that can help companies identify, assess, and manage their cyber risks and vulnerabilities. Additionally, there are pending legislative proposals that could impose new requirements on owners and operators of critical infrastructure. We cannot predict what proposals may ultimately be adopted or how such requirements, if any, would affect our businesses.
We are also subject to state and federal do not call laws regarding telemarketing and state and federal laws regarding unsolicited commercial emails, as well as FCC regulations relating to automated telemarketing calls, texts or SMS messages. Additional and more restrictive requirements may be imposed if and to the extent that state or local authorities establish their own privacy or security standards or if Congress enacts new privacy or security legislation.
Advertising Restrictions Legislation has been introduced and reports from various government agencies have been issued from time to time urging that restrictions be placed on advertisements for particular products or services, including prescription drugs and the marketing of food or violent entertainment to children, and on the deductibility of advertising expenses. We are unable to predict whether such reports would result in legislative proposals, whether legislative proposals may be adopted, or, if adopted, what impact they would have on our businesses.
Environmental Matters Certain of our business operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations and involve air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the use, disposal and cleanup of toxic and hazardous substances. Any failure to comply with environmental requirements could result in monetary fines, civil or criminal sanctions, third-party claims or other costs or liabilities. We have been responsible for the cleanup of environmental contamination at some of NBCUniversals current and former facilities and at off-site waste disposal locations, although our share of the cost of such cleanups to date has not been material. In addition, the California Attorney General and the Alameda County, California District Attorney are investigating whether certain of our waste disposal policies, procedures and practices are in violation of the California Business and Professions Code and the California Health and Safety Code. See Item3, Legal Proceedings, in this Part I for more information.
29 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents Environmental requirements have become more stringent over time, and pending or proposed new regulations could impact our operations or costs. For example, climate change regulation, such as proposed greenhouse gas emissions limits or cap and trade programs, could result in an increase in the cost of electricity, which is a significant component of our operational costs at some locations. We are unable to accurately predict how these requirements might be changed in the future and how any such changes might affect our businesses.
Disabilities Access Our businesses are subject to a number of requirements related to ensuring that our services are accessible to individuals with disabilities. Among other things, our voice services and email services must be accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities; we must provide additional narrations of key visual elements (referred to as video description) on certain of our video services and programming; and we must include closed captioning on certain video programming delivered to our customers. The FCC is very focused on accessibility issues and is currently considering the adoption of additional quality standards for closed captioning. The FCC also has adopted rules that will require that on-screen menus and program guides used on set-top boxes and other navigation devices to access multichannel video programming be audibly accessible to blind and low-vision customers. The FCC is considering further accessibility requirements for multichannel video providers, broadcasters and other entities, and we cannot predict what impact those further requirements would have on our businesses.
Other FCC Regulations The FCC actively regulates other aspects of our businesses, including the mandatory blackout of syndicated, network and sports programming; customer service standards; loudness of commercial advertisements; political advertising; Emergency Alert System requirements; equal employment opportunity; lottery programming; recordkeeping and public file access requirements; telemarketing; technical standards relating to operation of the cable systems and television stations; and regulatory fees. We are unable to predict how these regulations might be changed in the future and how any such changes might affect our businesses. In addition, while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with FCC regulations, we are occasionally subject to enforcement actions at the FCC, which can result in our having to pay fines to the agency or being subject to other sanctions.
Employees As of December31, 2013, we had approximately 136,000 full-time and part-time employees. Of these employees, approximately 83,000 and 40,000 were associated with our Cable Communications business and our NBCUniversal businesses, respectively. We also use freelance and temporary employees in the normal course of our business.

Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 30 Table of Contents Additionally, we operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. This environment is affected by government regulation; economic, strategic, political and social conditions; consumer response to new and existing products and services; technological developments; and, particularly in view of new technologies, the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements as a result of any of such factors, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
Item1A: Risk Factors Our businesses currently face a wide range of competition, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively.
All of our businesses operate in competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. There also continue to be new entrants with significant financial resources that potentially may compete on a larger scale with our cable services, as well as with our cable and broadcast networks and filmed entertainment businesses. Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and influencing consumer behavior, which is discussed immediately below in Changes in consumer behavior driven by new technologies may adversely affect our businesses.
Competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of DBS providers, which have a national footprint and compete in all our service areas, and phone companies, which overlap approximately 45% of our service areas and are continuing to expand their fiber-based networks. We also compete with other providers of traditional cable services. All of these companies typically offer features, pricing and packaging for services comparable to our cable services. Companies that offer services that enable Internet video streaming and downloading of video programming may also compete with our video services. Recently, Google launched high-speed Internet and video services in a limited number of areas, and there can be no assurance that it will not continue to launch these services in more of our services areas. Furthermore, our phone company competitors have their own wireless facilities and may expand their cable service offerings to include bundled wireless offerings, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Our cable communications business continues to seek ways to leverage our cable services network, such as by increasing the speed of our high-speed Internet services, by expanding and enhancing our business services to medium-sized businesses and by launching additional services, such as our home security and automation services. We expect these and other initiatives designed to help us compete effectively, such as deploying our X1 platform and wireless gateways, will require increased capital spending. There can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our cable communications revenue or to compete successfully in the future.
Each of NBCUniversals businesses also faces substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content, as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities. NBCUniversal must compete to obtain talent, programming and other resources required in operating these businesses. For example, our cable networks, broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for viewers with other similar networks and stations, as well as with other forms of entertainment and content available in the home, such as video games, DVDs and websites. In addition, our cable networks compete with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by multichannel video providers and online digital distributors. Our filmed entertainment business competes with other major studios and other producers of entertainment content for sources of financing for the production 31 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents of its films, for the exhibition of its films in theaters, and for shelf space in retail stores for its DVDs and with digital distributors for the licensing and sale of its products. It also competes for consumers with other film producers and distributors and all other forms of entertainment inside and outside the home.
Our cable communications business, cable networks, broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as radio stations, print media and websites. Additionally, our ability to compete depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, investors and governmental authorities.
For a more detailed description of the competition facing all of our businesses, see Business  Competition above. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses.
Changes in consumer behavior driven by new technologies may adversely affect our businesses.
We operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. New technologies, particularly alternative methods for the distribution, sale and viewing of content, have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and that drive changes in consumer behavior. These technologies may affect demand for all of our products and services as the number of entertainment choices available to, and the manner in which they are delivered to, consumers continue to increase and evolve. Our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging technologies or changes in consumer behavior could have an adverse effect on our businesses.
Newer services and technologies that may compete with our video services include digital distribution services and devices that offer Internet video streaming and downloading of movies, television shows and other video programming that can be viewed on television sets and computers, as well as other devices such as smartphones and tablets. Some of these services charge a nominal or no fee for access to their content, which could adversely affect demand for our video services, including for premium networks and our DVR, On Demand and streaming services. In addition, consumers are increasingly interested in accessing information, entertainment and communications services anywhere and anytime they want; newer services in wireless Internet technology such as 4G wireless broadband services and Wi-Fi networks, and devices such as wireless data cards, tablets, smartphones and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices, may compete with our high-speed Internet services. Our voice services are facing increased competition from wireless and Internet-based phone services as more people choose to replace their traditional wireline phone service with these phone services. The success of any of these ongoing and future developments may have an adverse effect on our cable communications competitive position, business and results of operations.
New technologies are also affecting consumer behavior in ways that are changing how content is viewed as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content, which may have a negative impact on our businesses and results of operations. For example, the increased availability of DVRs, video-on-demand services and cable, broadcast and other video programming on the Internet (including high-quality original video programming that may be viewed only through digital distribution services), as well as increased access to various media through wireless devices, have the potential to reduce the viewing of our content through traditional distribution outlets, which could adversely affect the demand for our video services, the price and amount of advertising that advertisers are willing to purchase from us, the amount multichannel video providers are willing to pay to NBCUniversal for its content and the levels of DVD and theatrical sales. These new technologies have increased the number of entertainment choices available to consumers and intensified the challenges posed by audience fragmentation. Some of these newer technologies also give consumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a time-delayed or on-demand basis or to fast-forward or skip advertisements within programming, which also may adversely impact the advertising revenue we receive. Delayed Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 32 Table of Contents viewing and advertising skipping have become more common as the penetration of DVRs has increased and as content has become increasingly available via video-on-demand services and Internet sources. Some of these new technologies are also challenging the existing legal copyright framework that we rely on to protect and monetize our intellectual property rights, as more fully discussed below in Our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others. These and other changes in technology, distribution platforms and consumer behavior could have an adverse effect on our businesses.
Our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments.
Our success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies, and our competitors use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage. For example, some companies are building costly fiber-optic networks that provide significant high-speed Internet access speeds and wireless Internet technologies continue to evolve rapidly. We expect other advances in communications technology to occur in the future. If we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so, or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Moreover, we may incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives, such as the deployment of our X1 platform and wireless gateways. We also may incur increased costs if changes in the products and services that our competitors offer require that we offer certain of our existing services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we make additional research and development expenditures, which could have an adverse effect on our businesses.
Programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect our businesses.
We expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be our Cable Communications segments largest single expense item and to increase in the foreseeable future. The multichannel video provider industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming, especially sports programming. In addition, as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers and through additional delivery platforms, we incur increased programming expenses. Additionally, we are currently paying certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. If we are unable to raise our customers rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Moreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of our video services and our businesses could be adversely affected.
We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which may impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses.
Federal, state and local governments extensively regulate the video services industry and may increase the regulation of the Internet service and VoIP voice service industries. We expect that legislative enactments, court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to clarify, and in some cases may adversely affect, the rights and obligations of cable operators and other entities under the Communications Act and other laws. Our broadcast television business also is highly regulated by federal laws and regulations, and our cable networks, filmed entertainment and theme parks businesses are subject to various other laws and regulations at the international, federal, state and local levels, including laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, which have become more stringent over time, and the safety of consumer products and theme 33 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents park operations. In addition, we are subject to the NBCUniversal Order and the NBCUniversal Consent Decree, which have imposed numerous conditions on our businesses relating to the treatment of competitors and other matters. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability.
Legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or prescribe new ones, which may significantly affect our businesses. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses, which could adversely affect our businesses. For example, in 2010, the FCC adopted open Internet regulations applicable to broadband Internet service providers (ISPs). The regulations required broadband ISPs such as us to disclose information regarding network management, performance and commercial terms of the service (the transparency rule); barred broadband ISPs from blocking access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; and barred wireline broadband ISPs such as us from unreasonably discriminating in transmitting lawful network traffic. The no-blocking and non-discrimination requirements allowed for reasonable network management. The FCC did not prohibit speed tiers or usage-based pricing, but specifically noted that paid prioritization (i.e., charging content, application and service providers for prioritizing their traffic over our last-mile facilities) or an ISPs prioritizing of its own Internet content likely would violate these regulations. In January 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated all of the FCCs rules except for the transparency rule but the court clarified that the FCC had the fundamental authority to regulate broadband Internet access services as a general matter. Although we remain bound by the FCCs original open Internet regulations as a condition of the NBCUniversal Order and the NBCUniversal Consent Decree for the remainder of the term of those orders, it is possible that the FCC may appeal the courts decision or seek to adopt new Internet regulations or take other actions that restrict the manner in which we and other ISPs provide Internet services. The FCC also may attempt to reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service, which would authorize the FCC to subject it to traditional common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. Under a Title II framework, the FCC could potentially regulate our customer rates for broadband Internet services and could prohibit or seriously restrict arrangements between us and Internet content, application, and service providers, including backbone connection arrangements. These arrangements historically have not been regulated by the FCC. The FCC Chairman, however, has stressed that the FCC has a responsibility to ensure connectivity of the Internet, and although he has made clear that he does not consider peering and transit arrangements to be an open Internet issue, he considers it a related issue that the FCC, at a minimum, should monitor. The FCC might also take a broader view of its existing authority, as confirmed by the court decision, to adopt any regulation that conceivably would promote broadband deployment and adoption so long as it is not a common carrier regulation, and states may also attempt to regulate the Internet pursuant to the courts decision. We cannot predict what, if any, proposals might be adopted or what effect they might have on our business. For a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of all of our businesses, see Business  Legislation and Regulation above.
Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.
A substantial portion of our revenue comes fromcustomers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions, or increases in price levels generally due to inflationary pressures, could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations. For example, customers may reduce the level of cable services to which they subscribe, or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our cable services. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as Internet video streaming and downloading services, or substitute services, such as mobile phones, smartphones and Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also may have a negative impact on the advertising revenue of our cable communications, cable networks and broadcast television businesses. Weak economic conditions could also reduce the fees that multichannel video providers pay for our cable networks programming and Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 34 Table of Contents for the retransmission of our broadcast television networks and stations content. Weak economic conditions have also in the past reduced, and could continue to reduce, the performance of our home entertainment releases in our filmed entertainment business and attendance and spending in our theme parks business. Weak economic conditions and turmoil in the global financial markets may also impair the ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us. Further, any disruption in the global financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. If these weak economic conditions continue or deteriorate, our businesses may be adversely affected.
A decline in advertising expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.
Our cable communications, cable networks and broadcast television businesses derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising on a variety of platforms, and a decline in advertising expenditures could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, by increased competition for the leisure time of audiences and audience fragmentation, by the growing use of new technologies, or by the economy in general, any of which may cause advertisers to alter their spending priorities based on these or other factors. In addition, advertisers willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings, which some of our cable networks have experienced and may continue to experience. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on audience measurement and could be negatively affected by changes in audience measurement methodologies. For example, newer methods of viewing content (such as delayed viewing on DVRs or viewing content on computers, tablets or smartphones) might not be counted in audience measurements or may generate less, if any, revenue than traditional distribution methods, which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue. Further, natural disasters, wars, acts of terrorism, or other significant adverse news events could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures as a result of uninterrupted news coverage and general economic uncertainty. Reductions in advertising expenditures could adversely affect our businesses.
NBCUniversals success depends on consumer acceptance of its content, which is difficult to predict, and its businesses may be adversely affected if its content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase.
Most of NBCUniversals businesses create and acquire media and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute cable network and broadcast television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer market. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content on our cable networks and broadcast television networks, in our films and for theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which it would earn consumer acceptance.
We also obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content. Entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs. Moreover, particularly with respect to long-term contracts for sports programming rights, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, our audience size, the ability to impose surcharges on multichannel video providers for the content and the timing and amount of our rights payments. There can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our cost for the rights, as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. If our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms, or at all, our businesses may be adversely affected.
35 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents The loss of NBCUniversals programming distribution agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect its businesses.
Our cable networks depend on the maintenance of distribution agreements with multichannel video providers. Our broadcast television networks depend on the maintenance of network affiliation agreements with third-party local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station. In addition, every three years, each of our owned local broadcast television stations must elect, with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its DMA, either must-carry status, in which the distributors carriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station, or retransmission consent, in which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with the distributor, including the amount of compensation, if any, paid to the station by such distributor. In the course of renewing distribution agreements with multichannel video providers, we may enter into retransmission consent agreements on behalf of our owned local broadcast television stations. All of our NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations have elected retransmission consent through December31, 2014. Our ability to continue to receive compensation from distributors as part of our retransmission consent negotiations may be adversely impacted by online entities that stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to us. Increasingly, our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses also have entered into agreements to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platforms. There can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be renewed in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. The loss of any of these agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could reduce the reach of our television programming and its attractiveness to advertisers, which in turn could adversely affect our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses.
Our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others.
We rely on our intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties, to use various technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. We may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert managements attention and resources away from our businesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, our businesses could be adversely affected.
In addition, intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of NBCUniversals businesses, and its success is highly dependent on protecting intellectual property rights in the content it creates or acquires against third-party misappropriation, reproduction or infringement. The unauthorized reproduction, distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content, and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights. For example, there is ongoing litigation related to a number of online entities that stream our broadcast television content online without the consent of, or compensation to, NBC or its affiliates, and the U.S. Supreme Court has granted certiorari to hear the broadcasting industrys challenge to one such entity. If this practice is validated, the fees multichannel video providers are willing to pay for our broadcast television content may be negatively impacted. We also have brought a suit against a multichannel video provider to challenge the commercial-skipping functionality in its DVR. None of this litigation is final, and the results as to the validity of these practices have been mixed to date.Additionally, there is a pending legislative proposal that seems Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 36 Table of Contents intended to legitimize some of these practices. There can be no assurance as to whether the courts will ultimately invalidate these practices or the pending legislation will be enacted, or how any such rulings or legislation would ultimately affect our businesses.
Piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier, and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging, by technological advances allowing the conversion of programming, films and other content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies. In particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution on DVDs, peer-to-peer computer networks and other platforms continues to present challenges for our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses. While piracy is a challenge in the United States, it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws, effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the United States. If any U.S. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced, or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights, and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase. See Business  Legislation and Regulation  Other Areas of Regulation  Intellectual Property above for additional information.
We rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and a disruption, cyber attack, failure or destruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses.
Network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to our network management, customer service operations and programming delivery, are critical to our business activities. Network and information systems-related events, such as computer hackings, cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, or power outages, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other similar events, could result in a degradation or disruption of our services, excessive call volume to call centers or damage to our properties, equipment and data. These events also could result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future. Further, any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems, including customer, personnel and vendor data, could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach. We may provide certain confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties in connection with our businesses, and while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information, there is a risk that this information may be compromised. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our businesses that may result, and the occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.
The risk of these systems-related events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify, in part because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our businesses in digital form stored on cloud servers. In the ordinary course of our business, there are frequent attempts to cause such systems-related events and security breaches, and we have experienced a few minor systems-related events that, to date, have not resulted in any significant degradation or disruption to our network or information systems or our services or operations. While we develop and maintain systems seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite these efforts, there can be no assurance that these events and security breaches will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our businesses.
37 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents We may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support.
We depend on third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our services. Some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products. While we actively monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties.If any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or if demand exceeds their capacity or they otherwise cannot meet our specifications, our ability to provide some services may be adversely affected.
Labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses.
Many of NBCUniversals employees, including writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel and others, as well as some of our on-air and creative talent and cable communications employees, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. If we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us. Moreover, many of NBCUniversals collective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. A labor dispute involving our employees may result in work stoppages or disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs. There can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages.
In addition, our cable networks and broadcast television networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events, including certain NFL, NHL, NBA and MLB games. Labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses.
The loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses.
We rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses.While we maintain long-term and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses. In addition, our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businessesdepend on the abilities and expertise of our on-air and creative talent. If we fail to retain our on-air or creative talent, if the costs to retain such talent increase materially, if we need to make significant termination payments, or if these individuals lose their current appeal, our businesses could be adversely affected.
We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.
We, primarily through NBCUniversal, operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil, economic volatility and the global economic slowdown, currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures, the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising, import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations, difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations, issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations, and potentially adverse tax developments. In addition, doing business internationally is subject to risks relating to political or social unrest, corruption and government regulation, including U.S. laws such as Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 38 Table of Contents the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. If these risks occur, our businesses may be adversely affected.
Acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction.
From time to time we make acquisitions and investments and enter into other strategic transactions. In connection with such acquisitions and strategic transactions, we may incur unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits, have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our businesses.
Our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock.
Our Class B common stock has a nondilutable 33 1 / 3 % of the combined voting power of our ClassA and Class B common stock. This nondilutable voting power is subject to proportionaldecrease to the extent the number of shares of Class B common stock is reduced below 9,444,375, which was the number of shares of Class B common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of AT&T Corp.s cable business, subject to adjustment in specified situations. Stock dividends payable on the Class B common stock in the form ofClass B or ClassA Special common stock do not decrease the nondilutable voting power ofthe Class B common stock.

39 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents Item1B: Unresolved Staff Comments None.
Item2: Properties We believe that substantially all of our physical assets were in good operating condition as of December31, 2013. Our corporate headquarters and Cable Communications segment headquarters are located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at One Comcast Center. In December 2013, we acquired an 80% interest in a business whose primary asset is One Comcast Center. Prior to this acquisition, the property was a leased facility. We also lease locations for numerous business offices, warehouses and properties housing divisional information technology operations throughout the country.
Cable Communications Segment Our principal physical assets consist of operating plant and equipment, including signal receiving, encoding and decoding devices, headends and distribution networks, and equipment at or near our customers homes. The signal receiving apparatus typically includes a tower, antenna, ancillary electronic equipment and ground stations for reception of satellite signals. Headends consist of electronic equipment necessary for the reception, amplification and modulation of signals and are located near the receiving devices. Our distribution network consists primarily of coaxial and fiber-optic cables, lasers, routers, switches and related electronic equipment. Our cable plant and related equipment generally are connected to utility poles under pole rental agreements with local public utilities, although in some areas the distribution cable is buried in underground ducts or trenches. Customer premise equipment (CPE) consists primarily of set-top boxes and cable modems. The physical components of cable systems require periodic maintenance and replacement.
Our signal reception sites, which consist primarily of antenna towers and headends, and our microwave facilities are located on owned and leased parcels of land, and we own or lease space on the towers on which certain of our equipment is located. We own most of our service vehicles.
Our high-speed Internet network consists of fiber-optic cables owned or leased by us and related equipment. We also operate regional data centers with equipment that is used to provide services (such as email, news and web services) to our high-speed Internet and voice services customers.

45 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents Item7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction and Overview We are a global media and technology company with two primary businesses, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal. We present our operations for Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications, and our operations for NBCUniversal in four reportable business segments.
Cable Communications Segment Comcast Cable is the nations largest provider of video, high-speed Internet and voice services (cable services) to residential customers under the XFINITY brand, and we also provide similar services to small and medium-sized businesses. As of December31, 2013, our cable systems served 21.7million video customers, 20.7million high-speed Internet customers and 10.7million voice customers and passed more than 53million homes and businesses. Our Cable Communications segment generates revenue primarily from subscriptions to our cable services, which we market individually and in packages, and from the sale of advertising. In 2013, our Cable Communications segment generated 65% of our consolidated revenue and 80% of our operating income before depreciation and amortization.
We offer a broad variety of video services with access to hundreds of channels, including premium networks, such as HBO, Showtime, Starz and Cinemax, pay-per-view channels, as well as On Demand, our video-on-demand service, and an interactive, on-screen program guide. Our video customers may also subscribe to a higher level of video service, including our HD video and DVR services. Our video customers have the ability to use XFINITY TV online or our mobile apps for smartphones and tablets to view certain live television programming and some of our On Demand content, browse program listings, and schedule and manage DVR recordings online.
Our high-speed Internet services generally provide Internet access at downstream speeds of up to 105 Mbps, and we also have introduced downstream speeds of up to 505 Mbps in limited markets. Our high-speed Internet service for business customers also includes a website hosting service and an interactive tool that allows customers to share, coordinate and store documents online.
Our voice services provide local and long-distance calling and other features. For our business voice customers, we also offer additional features such as hosted voice services that use cloud network servers, a business directory listing and the added capacity for multiple phone lines.
In addition to the video, high-speed Internet and voice services that we offer to small and medium-sized business customers, we offer Ethernet network services to our medium-sized business customers that connect multiple locations. We also provide cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators to help our customers manage network bandwidth.
We also sell advertising, under the Spotlight brand, that we receive through our distribution agreements with cable networks. We generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time on cable networks that we sell to local, regional and national advertisers.
The majority of our Cable Communications segment revenue is generated from subscriptions to our cable services. Customers are typically billed in advance on a monthly basis based on the services and features they receive and the type of equipment they use. Residential customers may generally discontinue service at any time, while business customers may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their contracts, which typically have 2 to 5 year terms.
Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 46 Table of Contents The most significant operating cost for our Cable Communications segment is the programming expenses we incur to provide content to our video customers. We anticipate that our programming expenses will continue to increase. We have, and will continue to attempt to, offset increases in programming expenses through rate increases, the sale of additional video and other services, and through operating efficiencies.
NBCUniversal Segments NBCUniversal is one of the worlds leading media and entertainment companies that develops, produces and distributes entertainment, news and information, sports, and other content for global audiences. The Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks segments comprise the NBCUniversal businesses and are collectively referred to as the NBCUniversal segments.
Cable Networks Our Cable Networks segment consists primarily of a diversified portfolio of cable television networks. Our cable networks are comprised of our national cable entertainment networks (USA Network, Syfy, E!, Bravo, Oxygen, Esquire Network, Sprout, Chiller, G4, Cloo, and Universal HD); our national cable news and information networks (MSNBC, CNBC and CNBC World); our national cable sports networks (Golf Channel and NBC Sports Network); our regional sports and news networks; various international cable networks; and our cable television production operations. Our Cable Networks segment generates revenue primarily from the distribution of our cable network programming to multichannel video providers, the sale of advertising on our cable networks and our related digital media properties, and the licensing of our owned programming.
Broadcast Television Our Broadcast Television segment consists primarily of the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks, our 10 NBC and 17 Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations and our broadcast television production operations. Our Broadcast Television segment generates revenue primarily from the sale of advertising on our broadcast networks, our owned local broadcast television stations and our related digital media properties, the licensing of our owned programming and fees received under retransmission consent agreements.
Filmed Entertainment Our Filmed Entertainment segment primarily produces, acquires, markets and distributes filmed entertainment worldwide. Our films are produced primarily under the Universal Pictures, Focus Features and Illumination names. Our Filmed Entertainment segment generates revenue primarily from the worldwide distribution of our owned and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters, the licensing of our owned and acquired films through various distribution platforms, and the sale of our owned and acquired films on standard-definition video discs and Blu-ray discs (together, DVDs) and through digital distributors. Our Filmed Entertainment segment also generates revenue from producing and licensing live stage plays, from distributing filmed entertainment produced by third parties, as well as from various digital media properties.
Theme Parks Our Theme Parks segment consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando and Hollywood. Our Theme Parks segment generates revenue primarily from theme park attendance and per capita spending. Per capita spending includes ticket price and in-park spending on food, beverages and merchandise. We also receive fees from third parties that own and operate Universal Studios Japan and Universal Studios Singapore for intellectual property licenses and other services.
Other Our other business interests primarily include Comcast-Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia and operates arena management-related businesses.
47 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents 2013 Developments The following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2013:  an increase in consolidated revenue of 3.3% to $64.7 billion and an increase in consolidated operating income of 11.4% to $13.6 billion  the acquisition in March 2013 of GEs remaining 49% common equity interest in NBCUniversal Holdings and NBCUniversals purchase from GE of certain properties NBCUniversal occupies; see Redemption Transaction below for additional information Cable Communications Segment  an increase in Cable Communications segment revenue of 5.6% to $41.8 billion and an increase in Cable Communications segment operating income before depreciation and amortization of 5.8% to $17.2 billion  an increase in Cable Communications segment capital expenditures of 9.8% to $5.4 billion primarily due to the investment in our IP and cloud-enabled video platform, referred to as our X1 platform, the deployment of our wireless gateways in customers homes, and our continued investment in network infrastructure, as well as the expansion of business services and our home security and automation services  our X1 platform is now available in all of the markets in which we operate, and we have purchased and deployed over 7million wireless gateways  the continued expansion of video offerings for our customers via On Demand and online, including the launch of a mobile app that enables live-streaming of certain programming content NBCUniversal Segments  an increase in total NBCUniversal revenue of 5.7% to $23.7 billion when excluding the impact from our broadcasts of the Super Bowl and London Olympics in 2012, and a decrease of 0.7% when including the $1.4 billion of revenue in the prior year related to these events  an increase in total NBCUniversal operating income before depreciation and amortization of 15.2% to $4.7 billion  the continued investment in original programming and sports programming rights at both our cable networks and broadcast networks and the continued investment in new attractions at our Universal theme parks, including the Transformers and Despicable Me attractions and the expansion of the Harry Potter attraction Redemption Transaction On March19, 2013, Comcast acquired GEs remaining 49% common equity interest in NBCUniversal Holdings for approximately $16.7 billion (the Redemption Transaction). In addition to this transaction, NBCUniversal purchased from GE certain properties NBCUniversal occupies at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City and CNBCs headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey for $1.4 billion. See Note 4 to Comcasts consolidated financial statements for additional information on these transactions.
Competition The results of operations of our reportable business segments are affected by competition, as all of our businesses operate in competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 48 Table of Contents growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. Additionally, there continue to be new companies with significant financial resources that potentially may compete on a larger scale with our cable services, as well as with our cable and broadcast networks and filmed entertainment businesses.
Competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of direct broadcast satellite (DBS) providers, which have a national footprint and compete in all our service areas, and phone companies, which overlap approximately 45% of our service areas and are continuing to expand their fiber-based networks. We also compete with other providers of traditional cable services. All of these companies typically offer features, pricing and packaging for services comparable to our cable services.
Each of NBCUniversals businesses also face substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content, as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities. NBCUniversal also must compete to obtain talent, programming and other resources required in operating its businesses.
Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape for all of our businesses by challenging existing business models and affecting consumer behavior. Newer services and devices that enable online digital distribution of movies, television shows, and other cable and broadcast video programming continue to gain consumer acceptance and evolve, including some services that charge a nominal or no fee for such programming. These services and devices may potentially negatively affect demand for our video services, as well as demand for our cable network, broadcast television and filmed entertainment content, as the number of entertainment choices available to consumers increases and as video programming is more reliably delivered over the Internet and more easily viewed via the Internet on televisions. Wireless services and devices also continue to evolve allowing consumers to access information, entertainment and communication services, which could negatively impact demand for our cable services, including for our voice services as people substitute mobile phones for landline phones. In addition, delayed viewing and advertising skipping have become more common as the penetration of DVRs and similar products has increased and as content has become increasingly available via video-on-demand services and Internet sources, which may have a negative impact on our advertising revenue.
In our Cable Communications segment, we believe that adding more content and delivering it on an increasing variety of platforms will assist in attracting and retaining customers for our cable services. We are also developing and launching new technology initiatives, such as our X1 platform, and deploying new wireless gateway devices, to further enhance our video and high-speed Internet services. In our NBCUniversal segments, to compete for consumers of our content and for customers at our theme parks, we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in acquiring content and producing original content for our cable networks and broadcast television networks, including the acquisition of sports rights, and will continue to invest in our film productions and in the development of new theme park attractions. See Business  Competition for additional information.
Seasonality and Cyclicality Each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. In our Cable Communications segment, our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of customers receiving our cable services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in a reduction in net customer additions in the second calendar quarter and increased net customer additions in the third and fourth calendar quarters of each year.
Revenue in our Cable Communications, Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Our U.S. advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth calendar quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season. U.S. advertising revenue is also cyclical, benefiting in even-numbered years from advertising related to candidates running for political office 49 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents and issue-oriented advertising. Our Broadcast Television revenue and operating costs and expenses are also cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of the Olympic Games and the Super Bowl. Our advertising revenue generally increases in the period of these broadcasts from increased demand for advertising time, and our operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs and the amortization of the related rights fees. All of the revenue and operating costs and expenses associated with our broadcasts of the 2012 London Olympics and the 2012 Super Bowl were reported in our Broadcast Television segment.
Revenue in our Filmed Entertainment segment fluctuates due to the timing of the release of films in movie theaters and the release of our films on DVD and through digital distributors. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holidays. Revenue in our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired on television, which typically results in higher advertising revenue in the second and fourth calendar quarter of each year. Revenue in our Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Filmed Entertainment segments also fluctuates due to the timing of when our owned content is made available to licensees.
Revenue in our Theme Parks segment fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel, local entertainment offerings and seasonal weather variations. Our theme parks generally experience peak attendance during the summer months when schools are closed and during early winter and spring holiday periods.

Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 50 Table of Contents 2013 Consolidated Operating Results by Segment Consolidated Revenue In 2013, our Cable Communications, Cable Networks, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks segments accounted for substantially all of the increase in consolidated revenue. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue in our Broadcast Television segment due to revenue recorded in 2012 attributable to our broadcasts of the 2012 Super Bowl and the 2012 London Olympics. Excluding $259 million and $1.2 billion of revenue associated with our broadcasts of the 2012 Super Bowl and the 2012 London Olympics, respectively, consolidated revenue increased 5.8% in 2013.
In 2012, our Cable Communications, Broadcast Television and Filmed Entertainment segments accounted for substantially all of the increase in consolidated revenue. The increase in our Broadcast Television segment was primarily due to our broadcasts of the 2012 Super Bowl and the 2012 London Olympics.
Revenue for our segments is discussed separately below under the heading Segment Operating Results.
Consolidated Costs and Expenses In 2013, our Cable Communications, Cable Networks and Theme Parks segments accounted for substantially all of the increase in consolidated costs and expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization (operating costs and expenses). The increase was partially offset by a decrease in operating costs and expenses in our Broadcast Television segment due to operating costs and expenses recorded in 2012 attributable to our broadcasts of the 2012 Super Bowl and the 2012 London Olympics.
In 2012, our Cable Communications, Broadcast Television and Filmed Entertainment segments accounted for substantially all of the increase in consolidated operating costs and expenses. The increase in our Broadcast Television segment was primarily due to our broadcasts of the 2012 Super Bowl and the 2012 London Olympics.
Operating costs and expenses for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading Segment Operating Results.
Consolidated depreciation and amortization increased slightly in 2013 primarily due to increases in capital spending in our Cable Communications and Theme Parks segments, as well as depreciation associated with the acquisition of real estate properties by NBCUniversal in 2013. Consolidated depreciation and amortization increased slightly in 2012 primarily due to the impact of consolidating NBCUniversal and Universal Orlando for a full year period for the first time in 2012.
51 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents Segment Operating Results Our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. We use operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of assets, if any, as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. Additionally, it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. We use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Because we use operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization to measure our segment profit or loss, we reconcile it to operating income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) in the business segment footnote to our consolidated financial statements (see Note 19 to Comcasts consolidated financial statements and Note 18 to NBCUniversals consolidated financial statements). This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, net income (loss) attributable to NBCUniversal, net cash provided by operating activities, or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with GAAP.
Beginning in 2013, revenue in our Cable Communications segment from certain business customers, such as hotels, restaurants and bars, is presented in business services revenue rather than in video revenue. Also beginning in 2013, operating costs and expenses for our Cable Communications segment present franchise and other regulatory fees under a new caption, and the former technical labor caption was expanded to include both technical and product support expenses; previously, franchise and other regulatory fees and product support expenses had been included under the other caption. The presentation of operating costs and expenses in our Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Filmed Entertainment segments was also expanded to present programming and production costs, other operating and administrative expenses, and advertising, marketing and promotion expenses. Reclassifications have been made to 2012 and 2011 to conform to the classifications used in 2013.

Cable Communications Segment  Revenue Our Cable Communications segment leverages our existing cable distribution system to grow revenue by, among other things, adding new customers, encouraging existing cable customers to add new or higher tier services, and growing other services such as our business services offerings and our home security and automation services. We offer our cable services in bundles and often provide promotional incentives. We seek to balance promotional offers and rate increases with their expected effects on the number of customers and overall revenue.
Video Video revenue increased 2.9% and 2.5% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Increases in revenue of approximately 5% in both years were primarily related to customers receiving additional and higher levels of video service, as well as from rate adjustments. As of December31, 2013, 12.4million customers subscribed to at least one of our HDTV or DVR advanced services compared to 11.8million customers and 10.9million customers as of December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In both years, the increases in revenue were partially offset by fewer residential video customers. These decreases were primarily due to competitive pressures in our service areas from phone and satellite competitors and the impact of rate adjustments. We may experience further declines in the number of residential video customers.
53 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents As of December31, 2013, 40% of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our video services, compared to 41% and 43% as of December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
High-Speed Internet High-speed Internet revenue increased 8.3% and 9.2% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Increases in the number of residential customers accounted for increases in revenue of approximately 6% in both years. The remaining increases in revenue in 2013 and 2012 were primarily due to higher rates from customers receiving higher levels of service and rate adjustments.
As of December31, 2013, 38% of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our high-speed Internet services, compared to 36% and 35% as of December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our customer base continues to grow as consumers continue to choose our high-speed Internet service and seek higher speed offerings.
Voice Voice revenue increased 2.8% and 1.5% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Increases in the number of residential customers receiving our services through our discounted bundled offerings accounted for increases in revenue of approximately 6% and 4% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. These increases were partially offset in both years by the impact of the allocation of voice revenue for our bundled customers because revenue attributable to voice services represents a lower proportion of the bundled rate. The amounts allocated to voice revenue in the bundled rate have decreased in 2013 and 2012 because video and high-speed Internet rates have increased, while voice rates have remained relatively flat.
As of December31, 2013, 20% of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our voice services, compared to 19% and 18% as of December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Business Services Business services revenue increased 26.4% and 31.3% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increases in both years were primarily due to a higher number of business customers receiving our cable services. The remaining increases in both years were primarily due to continued growth in the number of medium-sized business customers, including those receiving our Ethernet network and cellular backhaul services. In 2013, our medium-sized business customers represented 19% of total business services revenue, compared to 15% and 12% in 2012 and 2011, respectively. We believe these increases in business customers are primarily the result of our efforts to gain market share from competitors by offering competitive products and pricing.
Advertising As part of our distribution agreements with cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time on cable networks that we sell to local, regional and national advertisers under the Spotlight brand. In most cases, the available advertising time is sold by our sales force. In some cases, we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising time allocated to us. We also represent the advertising sales of other multichannel video providers in some markets. In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of advertising online and on our On Demand service.
Advertising revenue is affected by the strength of the advertising market and general economic conditions. Advertising revenue decreased 4.2% in 2013 primarily due to lower political advertising revenue. Excluding the impact of political advertising revenue in 2012, advertising revenue increased 4.8% primarily due to increases in the national and regional advertising markets. Advertising revenue increased 14.1% in 2012 primarily due to increases in political advertising revenue and improvements in the local and regional advertising markets, which were primarily driven by increased spending from automotive advertisers.
Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 54 Table of Contents Other We receive revenue related to cable franchise and other regulatory fees, our digital media center, commissions from electronic retailing networks, and fees from other services. Cable franchise and regulatory fees represent the fees required to be paid to federal, state and local authorities that we pass through to our customers. Under the terms of our cable franchise agreements, we are generally required to pay to the cable franchising authority an amount based on our gross video revenue. The changes in franchise and other regulatory fees collected from our cable services customers are generally due to changes in the revenue on which the fees apply.
Other revenue increased 10.5% and 9.0% in 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily due to increases in franchise and other regulatory fees and in revenue from other services, including our home security and automation services.
Cable Communications Segment  Operating Costs and Expenses We continue to focus on controlling the growth of expenses. Our operating margin, which is our operating income before depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue, for 2013, 2012 and 2011 was 41.1%, 41.0% and 41.1%, respectively.
Programming Costs Programming expenses, our largest operating expense, are the fees we pay to license the programming we distribute to our video customers. These expenses are affected by the programming license fees charged by cable networks, fees for retransmission of the signals from local broadcast television stations, the number of video customers we serve and the amount of content we provide. Programming costs increased in 2013 and 2012 primarily due to increases in programming license fees, including sports programming and retransmission consent fees, and fees to secure rights for additional programming for our customers across an increasing number of platforms.
We anticipate that our programming expenses will continue to increase as we provide additional content, including in HD, to our video customers; as we deliver this content through an increasing number of platforms, including On Demand, online and through our mobile apps for smartphones and tablets; and as the fees we pay increase, primarily from sports programming costs and retransmission consent fees. We believe that adding more content and delivering it on various platforms will help us to attract and retain video customers.
Technical and Product Support Expenses Technical and product support expenses include costs to complete service call and installation activities, as well as network operations, product development, fulfillment and provisioning costs. Technical and product support expenses increased in 2013 and 2012 primarily due to expenses related to customer fulfillment activities and expenses related to the development, delivery and support of our products and services, and continued growth in business services.
Customer Service Expenses Customer service expenses include the personnel and other costs associated with handling customer sales and service activity. Customer service expenses increased in 2013 and 2012 primarily due to increases in total labor costs associated with increases in customer service activity. The increases in customer service activity were primarily due to increases in the number of customers as well as sales and related support activities associated with the continued deployment of enhanced services and devices, including our X1 platform and wireless gateways, and continued growth in business services.
55 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents Franchise and Other Regulatory Fees Franchise and other regulatory fees increased in 2013 and 2012 primarily due to increases in residential and business services revenue.
Advertising, Marketing and Promotion Expenses Advertising, marketing and promotion expenses increased in 2013 and 2012 primarily due to increases in spending associated with attracting new residential and business services customers and expanding our services to existing customers.
Other Costs and Expenses Other costs and expenses increased in 2013 and 2012 primarily due to increases in other administrative costs and advertising sales activities.
NBCUniversal Segments Overview The discussion below compares the NBCUniversal segments actual results for 2013 and 2012, as well as the pro forma combined results for 2011. The pro forma combined amounts for 2011 presented in the tables below include pro forma adjustments as if the NBCUniversal and Universal Orlando transactions each had occurred on January1, 2010. Pro forma combined amounts are not necessarily indicative of what our results would have been had we operated the NBCUniversal contributed businesses or Universal Orlando since that date, nor of our future results.
During 2013, 2012 and 2011, there were no changes to NBCUniversals accounting principles or practices that had a material effect on its net income.

Distribution revenue increased in 2013 and 2012 primarily due to increases in the contractual rates that we charged under distribution agreements.
In 2013, 2012 and 2011, 13% of our Cable Networks segment revenue was generated from our Cable Communications segment. These amounts are eliminated in Comcasts consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above.
Advertising Advertising revenue is generated from the sale of advertising time on our cable networks and related digital media properties. Our advertising revenue is generally based on audience ratings, the value of our viewer demographics to advertisers, and the number of advertising units we can place in our cable networks programming schedules. Advertising revenue is affected by the strength of the national advertising market, general economic conditions and the success of our programming.
Advertising revenue increased 4.3% and 2.2% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Higher prices and an increase in the volume of advertising units sold contributed to increases of 8.9% and 12.9% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. These increases were partially offset by continued declines in audience ratings at some of our networks.
Content Licensing and Other We also generate other revenue primarily from the licensing of our owned programming to various distribution platforms, including cable and broadcast networks, and to digital distributors.
Content licensing and other revenue increased in 2013 primarily due to a new licensing agreement entered into during the year. Content licensing and other revenue remained flat in 2012.
Cable Networks Segment  Operating Costs and Expenses Programming and Production Programming and production costs include the amortization of owned and acquired programming, sports rights, direct production costs, residual and participation payments, production overhead, costs associated with the distribution of our programming to third-party networks and other distribution platforms, and on-air talent costs.
Programming and production costs increased in 2013 and 2012 primarily due to our continued investment in original programming at certain of our cable networks and higher sports programming costs. The increase in sports programming costs in 2013 included the impact from an increase in the number of NHL games compared to 2012 due to the NHL lockout in 2012 as well as costs associated with our broadcasts of the English Premier League soccer. The increase in sports programming costs in 2012 included the impact from an increase in the number of NBA games compared to 2011 due to the NBA lockout in 2011.
Other Operating and Administrative Other operating and administrative costs and expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other overhead expenses.
Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 58 Table of Contents Other operating and administrative costs and expenses increased in 2013 and 2012 primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs.
Advertising, Marketing and Promotion Advertising, marketing and promotion expenses consist primarily of the costs incurred in promoting our cable networks and costs associated with digital media.
Advertising, marketing and promotion expenses increased in 2013 primarily due to increased spending on marketing across our cable network portfolio primarily due to the launch of new programming on our cable networks. Advertising, marketing and promotion expenses remained relatively flat in 2012.

Our advertising revenue is generally based on audience ratings, the value of our viewer demographics to advertisers, and the number of advertising units we can place in our broadcast networks and owned local television stations programming schedules. Advertising revenue is affected by the strength of the national and local advertising markets, general economic conditions, and the success and ratings of our programming.
Advertising revenue decreased in 2013 and increased in 2012 primarily due to $1.2 billion of advertising revenue recorded in 2012 associated with our broadcasts of the 2012 Super Bowl and the 2012 London 59 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents Olympics. Excluding the impact of these events, advertising revenue increased 5% and 9% in 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily due to higher prices and volume of advertising units sold, which included the impact of an increase in political advertising in 2012.
Content Licensing Content licensing revenue is generated from the licensing of our owned programming in the United States and internationally, including to cable and broadcast networks and digital distributors. The subsequent licensing of our owned programming series following the initial network license is critical to their financial success as the production and distribution costs related to our owned programming generally exceed the revenue generated from the initial network license.
Content licensing revenue decreased in 2013 and 2012 primarily due to the timing of licensing agreements.
Other We also generate other revenue primarily from fees for retransmission consent of our owned broadcast television stations and associated fees received from our affiliated local television stations, as well as from the sale of our owned programming on DVDs and through online digital distributors. The sale of our owned programming is driven primarily by the popularity of our broadcast networks and programming series and, therefore, fluctuates based on consumer spending and acceptance. Other revenue also includes distribution revenue associated with our periodic broadcasts of the Olympic Games.
Other revenue decreased in 2013 and increased in 2012 primarily due to $266 million of distribution revenue from multichannel video providers in 2012 associated with our broadcast of the London Olympics. The decrease in 2013 was partially offset by an increase in fees received under our retransmission consent agreements.
Broadcast Television Segment  Operating Costs and Expenses Programming and Production Programming and production expenses relate to content originating on our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations and include the amortization of owned and acquired programming costs, sports rights, direct production costs, residual and participation payments, production overhead, costs associated with the distribution of our programming to third-party networks and other distribution platforms, and on-air talent costs.
Programming and production costs decreased in 2013 and increased in 2012 primarily due to programming rights and production costs of $1.3 billion associated with our broadcasts of the 2012 London Olympics and 2012 Super Bowl. Excluding the impact of these events, programming and production costs increased in 2013 and 2012 primarily due to our continued investment in original programming.

Theatrical revenue is also affected by the number of exhibition screens, ticket prices, the percentage of ticket sale retention by the exhibitors and the popularity of competing films at the time our films are released. The success of a film in movie theaters is a significant factor in determining the revenue a film is likely to generate in succeeding distribution platforms.
Theatrical revenue increased in 2013 primarily due to the strong performance of Despicable Me 2 and Fast and Furious 6 . Theatrical revenue increased in 2012 primarily due to the strong performance of Ted , Dr.Seuss The Lorax and The Bourne Legacy .
Content Licensing Content licensing revenue is generated primarily from the licensing of our owned and acquired films to cable, broadcast and premium networks, as well as to digital distributors.
Content licensing revenue increased in 2013 primarily due to the international licensing of our 2012 theatrical releases as well as from the licensing of our current year theatrical releases to digital distributors. Content 61 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents licensing revenue increased in 2012 primarily due to a higher volume of our owned and acquired films made available to licensees in 2012, as well as an increase in the licensing of our content to digital distributors.
Home Entertainment Home entertainment revenue is generated from the sale of our owned and acquired films on DVDs to retail stores, rental kiosks and subscription by mail services, and through digital distributors. Home entertainment revenue is significantly affected by the timing and number of our releases and their acceptance by consumers. Release dates are determined by several factors, including the timing of the exhibition of a film in movie theaters, holiday periods and the timing of competitive releases.
Home entertainment revenue remained flat in 2013 primarily due to a decrease in the number of releases in 2013 compared to 2012 offset by the strong performance of Despicable Me 2 and Fast and Furious 6 .
Home entertainment revenue increased in 2012 primarily due to an increased number of, and improved performance of, our 2012 releases compared to our 2011 releases.
While we experienced successful DVD releases in 2013 such as Despicable Me 2 and Fast and Furious 6 , the overall DVD market continues to experience declines due to the impact of weak economic conditions, the maturation of the standard-definition DVD format, piracy, and increasing shifts in consumer behavior toward digital distributors, subscription rental services and discount rental kiosks, which generate less revenue per transaction than DVD sales.
Other We also generate revenue from producing and licensing live stage plays, distributing filmed entertainment produced by third parties and from various digital media properties. Other revenue increased slightly in 2013 primarily due to an increase in revenue generated from our stage plays. Other revenue decreased in 2012 primarily due to lower revenue generated from our stage plays as a result of fewer productions.
Filmed Entertainment Segment  Operating Costs and Expenses Programming and Production Programming and production expenses include the amortization of capitalized film production and acquisition costs, residual and participation payments, and distribution expenses. Residual payments represent amounts payable to certain of our employees, including freelance and temporary employees, who are represented by labor unions or guilds and are based on post-theatrical revenue. Participation payments are primarily based on film performance and represent contingent consideration payable to creative talent, third parties that have entered into cofinancing agreements with us and other parties involved in the production of a film.
Programming and production costs decreased slightly in 2013 and increased in 2012 primarily due to higher amortization of film costs in 2012 associated with the higher cost of our 2012 film slate.
Other Operating and Administrative Other operating and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other overhead expenses.
Other operating and administrative expenses increased in 2013 primarily due to the realization of a receivable in 2012 that was previously reserved for as uncollectible. Other operating and administrative expenses decreased in 2012 due to lower costs associated with our stage plays business as a result of fewer productions.
Advertising, Marketing and Promotion Advertising and marketing expenses consist primarily of expenses associated with advertising for our theatrical releases and the marketing of DVDs. We incur significant marketing expenses before and throughout the Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 62 Table of Contents release of a film in movie theaters. As a result, we typically incur losses on a film prior to and during the films exhibition in movie theaters and may not realize profits, if any, until the film generates home entertainment and content licensing revenue. The costs associated with producing and marketing films have generally increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future.
Advertising, marketing and promotion expenses decreased in 2013 primarily due to fewer significant theatrical releases in 2013 compared to 2012. Advertising, marketing and promotion expenses increased in 2012 primarily due to an increase in marketing costs associated with our 2012 theatrical and DVD releases.

The results of operations for Universal Orlando for the period January29, 2011 through June30, 2011 are eliminated from our consolidated results because Universal Orlando was recorded as an equity method investment during that period.
Theme Parks Segment  Revenue Our Theme Parks segment revenue is generated primarily from theme park attendance and per capita spending at our Universal theme parks in Orlando and Hollywood, as well as from license and other fees.
Attendance at our theme parks and per capita spending depend heavily on the general environment for travel and tourism, including consumer spending on travel and other recreational activities. License and other fees relate primarily to our agreements with third parties that operate the Universal Studios Japan and the Universal Studios Singapore theme parks to license the Universal Studios brand name and other intellectual property.
Theme Parks segment revenue increased in 2013 and 2012 primarily due to higher guest attendance and increases in per capita spending at our Orlando and Hollywood theme parks. The increases in 2013 and 2012 were primarily driven by the continued success of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Orlando and the Transformers attractions in Orlando and Hollywood, which opened in June 2013 and May 2012, respectively.
Theme Parks Segment  Operating Costs and Expenses Our Theme Parks segment operating costs and expenses consist primarily of theme park operations, including repairs and maintenance and related administrative expenses; food, beverage and merchandise costs; labor costs; and sales and marketing costs.
Theme Parks segment operating costs and expenses increased in 2013 and 2012 primarily due to additional costs at our Orlando and Hollywood theme parks associated with additional attractions and increases in food, beverage and merchandise costs associated with the increases in attendance.
63 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents NBCUniversal Headquarters, Other and Eliminations Headquarters and Other operating costs and expenses incurred by our NBCUniversal businesses include overhead, personnel costs and costs associated with corporate initiatives. Operating costs and expenses increased in 2013 primarily due to higher employee costs. Operating costs and expenses remained flat in 2012 primarily due to higher technology and administrative costs offset by the impact of transaction-related costs associated with the 2011 NBCUniversal transaction, including severance and other compensation-related costs.
Eliminations include the results of operations for Universal Orlando for the period January29, 2011 through June30, 2011. Our Theme Parks segment included the results of operations of Universal Orlando for this period because these amounts had been reflected in our segment performance measure. These amounts were not included when we measured total NBCUniversal and our consolidated results of operations because we recorded Universal Orlando as an equity method investment for the period January29, 2011 through June30, 2011.

Other revenue increased in 2013 primarily due to an increase in the number of NHL games compared to 2012 due to the lockout in 2012. Other revenue decreased in 2012 primarily due to a loss in revenue associated with the NHL lockout.
Corporate and Other  Operating Costs and Expenses Corporate and Other operating costs and expenses primarily include overhead, personnel costs, the cost of corporate initiatives incurred by our Comcast businesses and operating costs and expenses associated with Comcast-Spectacor.
Corporate and Other operating costs and expenses increased in 2013 primarily due to $74 million of expenses associated with the final settlement of the terminated qualified pension plan that provided benefits to former employees of a company we acquired as part of the AT&T Broadband transaction in 2002 as well as an increase in labor costs in our Comcast-Spectacor business. Corporate and Other operating costs and expenses decreased in 2012 primarily due to the NHL lockout.

Interest expense remained flat in 2012.
Investment Income (Loss), Net Investment income (loss), net increased in 2013 primarily due to the $443 million gain related to the sale of our investment in Clearwire Corporation (Clearwire) in July 2013. The components of investment income (loss), net in 2013, 2012 and 2011 are presented in a table in Note 6 to Comcasts consolidated financial statements.
Equity in Net Income (Losses) of Investees, Net The changes in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net in 2013 and 2012 were primarily due to the $876 million of income that was recorded in 2012 related to our portion of SpectrumCos gain on sale of its advanced wireless services spectrum licenses, as well as $142 million of total equity losses recorded in 2013 attributable to our investment in Hulu, LLC (Hulu). In July 2013, we entered into an agreement to providecapital contributions totaling $247 million to Hulu, which we had previously accounted for as a cost method investment. This represented an agreement to provide our first capital contribution to Hulu since our interest was acquired as part of the NBCUniversal transaction, therefore we began to apply the equity method of accounting for this investment. The change in the method of accounting for this investment required us to recognize Hulus accumulated losses from the date of the NBCUniversal transaction through July 2013.
Other Income (Expense), Net The changes in other income (expense), net in 2013 and 2012 were primarily due to the $1 billion gain recorded in 2012 related to the sale of our investment in A&E Television Networks LLC (A&E Television Networks), as well as an impairment of $236 million of our equity method investment in, and loans with, a regional sports cable network based in Houston, Texas, which was recorded in 2013.
Consolidated Income Tax Expense Income tax expense reflects federal and state income taxes, adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions and, until the close of the Redemption Transaction in March 2013, the partnership structure of NBCUniversal Holdings whereby income tax expense was not recorded on the portion of its consolidated income that was attributable to GEs noncontrolling interest. Our effective income tax rate in 2013, 2012 and 2011 was 35.8%, 32.3% and 37.2%, respectively. In 2013, our effective income tax rate increased due to the Redemption Transaction in March 2013 in which we acquired GEs noncontrolling common equity interest in NBCUniversal and subsequently recorded income tax expense on all of its consolidated income. In addition, our 2013 income tax expense was reduced by $158 million due to the nontaxable portion of the increase in tax basis associated with the redemption of Liberty Media Series A common stock in October 2013. In 2012, our effective income tax rate decreased due to proportionately higher pretax income at NBCUniversal, which included NBCUniversals gain on the sale of its equity interest in A&E Television Networks. In addition, our 2012 income tax expense decreased by $109 million due to certain changes in state tax laws that became 65 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents effective in 2012. Our income tax expense in the future may continue to be impacted by adjustments to uncertain tax positions and related interest, and changes in tax laws. We expect our 2014 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 37% to 39%, absent changes in tax laws or significant changes in uncertain tax positions.
Consolidated Net (Income) Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Subsidiary Preferred Stock The decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2013 was primarily due to our acquisition of GEs remaining 49% common equity interest in NBCUniversal Holdings in March 2013. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2012 was primarily due to GEs allocated share of the increase in earnings of NBCUniversal during 2012.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities. We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities, existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, available borrowings under our existing credit facilities, and our ability to obtain future external financing. We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to meet our debt repayment obligations, to fund our capital expenditures, to invest in business opportunities and to return capital to shareholders.
We also maintain significant availability under our lines of credit and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements.
Our commercial paper program provides a lower cost source of borrowing to fund our short-term working capital requirements and is supported by the Comcast and Comcast Cable Communications, LLC $6.25 billion revolving credit facility due June 2017. In September 2013, we increased the borrowing capacity of our commercial paper program from $2.25 billion to $6.25 billion.
As of December31, 2013, amounts available under our consolidated revolving credit facilities, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and outstanding letters of credit, totaled $4.7 billion, which included $100 million available under NBCUniversal Enterprise, Inc.s (NBCUniversal Enterprise) credit facility.
In March 2013, we, four of our wholly owned cable holding company subsidiaries (the cable guarantors) and NBCUniversal entered into a series of agreements and supplemental indentures to include NBCUniversal as part of our existing cross-guarantee structure. As members of the cross-guarantee structure, we and the cable guarantors fully and unconditionally guarantee NBCUniversals public debt securities, and NBCUniversal fully and unconditionally guarantees all of our and the cable guarantors public debt securities, as well as our $6.25 billion revolving credit facility. We and the cable guarantors also fully and unconditionally guarantee NBCUniversal Enterprises $4 billion of senior notes and its $1.35 billion credit facility due March 2018. NBCUniversal does not guarantee the NBCUniversal Enterprise senior notes or credit facility. See Note 21 to Comcasts consolidated financial statements for additional information on our subsidiary cross-guarantee structure.
We, NBCUniversal and our Cable Communications subsidiaries that have provided guarantees are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our public debt securities and in the credit agreements governing the Comcast and Comcast Cable Communications credit facility. We test for compliance with the covenants for our credit facility on an ongoing basis. The only financial covenant is in our credit facility and pertains to leverage, which is the ratio of debt to operating income before depreciation and Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 66 Table of Contents amortization, as defined in the credit facility. As of December31, 2013, we met this financial covenant by a significant margin. We do not expect to have to reduce debt or improve operating results in order to continue to comply with this financial covenant.
Receivables Monetization In December 2013, the programs under which NBCUniversal monetized certain of its accounts receivable with a syndicate of banks were terminated. The final payments of $1.4 billion associated with the termination of these programs are a component of net cash provided by operating activities in Comcasts and NBCUniversals consolidated statement of cash flows. See Note 17 to Comcasts consolidated financial statements and Note 16 to NBCUniversals consolidated financial statements for additional information.

The increases were partially offset by payments made in 2013 related to the termination of a film financing arrangement and payments of our accounts payable and accrued expenses related to trade creditors, as well as the timing of other operating items.
The changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2012 compared to the changes in 2011 were primarily related to a decrease in film and television costs, partially offset by the settlement in 2012 of a $237 million liability associated with an unfavorable Olympic contract that had been recorded through the application of acquisition accounting in 2011, as well as the timing of other operating items, including accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses related to trade creditors.
Interest payments remained relatively flat in 2013 compared to 2012. The decrease in interest payments in 2012 was primarily due to the repayment and redemption of certain of our debt obligations.
The increase in income tax payments in 2013 was primarily due to higher taxable income from operations, the net impact of the economic stimulus legislation, the settlement of tax disputes and the repatriation of foreign earnings. The increase in income tax payments in 2012 was primarily due to increases in taxable income, which resulted in higher federal tax payments made in 2012, and the lower net benefit in 2012 of the economic stimulus legislation.We expect income tax payments to increase in 2014 primarily due to higher taxable income from operations and the expiration of the economic stimulus legislation.
67 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities in 2013 consisted primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures, acquisitions of real estate properties, purchases of investments and cash paid for intangible assets. Net cash used in investing activities in 2012 consisted primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures, cash paid for intangible assets and the purchase of investments and was substantially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses and investments and return of capital from investees.
Capital Expenditures Our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures in our Cable Communications segment, and we expect that this will continue in the future. The table below summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our Cable Communications segment in 2013, 2012 and 2011.
Year ended December31 (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Cable distribution system $ 1,819 $ 1,720 $ 1,715 Customer premise equipment 2,990 2,678 2,594 Other equipment 527 462 420 Buildings and building improvements 67 57 77 Land  4  Total $ 5,403 $ 4,921 $ 4,806 Cable Communications capital expenditures increased in 2013 and 2012 primarily due to an increase in customer premise equipment purchases, including purchases related to our X1 platform and our wireless gateways in 2013, and increased investment in business services and network capacity.
Capital expenditures in our NBCUniversal segments increased 52.0% to $1.2 billion in 2013 primarily due to continued investment at our Universal theme parks. Capital expenditures in our NBCUniversal segments increased 75.7% to $763 million in 2012 primarily due to increased investment at our Universal theme parks and increased investment in technical infrastructure to support our cable networks and broadcast television operations.
The rate of growth of our capital expenditures for 2014 is expected to increase as we continue to invest significantly in the deployment of our X1 platform and wireless gateways to our customers and the expansion of business services and our home security and automation services. Capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors, including acquisitions, competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes, and the timing and rate of deployment of new services and capacity for existing services. In addition, we have invested and expect to continue to invest in existing and new attractions at our Universal theme parks.
Cash Paid for Intangible Assets In 2013 and 2012, cash paid for intangible assets consisted primarily of software.
Acquisitions of Real Estate Properties In 2013, acquisitions of real estate properties included NBCUniversals purchases of the 30 Rockefeller Plaza properties it occupies in connection with the Redemption Transaction, NBCUniversals purchase of the property located at 10 Universal City Plaza, which is adjacent to Universal Studios in Hollywood, California and our purchase of an 80% interest in a business whose primary asset is our corporate headquarters located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 68 Table of Contents Acquisitions Our 2013 and 2012 acquisitions were not significant. In 2011, we closed the NBCUniversal transaction and NBCUniversal acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in Universal Orlando that it did not already own. See Note 4 to Comcasts consolidated financial statements for additional information on our acquisitions.
Proceeds from Sales of Businesses and Investments In 2013, proceeds from sales of businesses and investments were primarily related to the redemption of our Liberty Media Series A common stock by Liberty Media Corporation and the sale of our investment in Clearwire. In 2012, proceeds from sales of businesses and investments were primarily related to the A&E Television Networks transaction. Following the close of the A&E Television Networks transaction, NBCUniversal no longer receives dividends from A&E Television Networks. In 2012 and 2011, NBCUniversal received $129 million and $196 million, respectively, in dividends from A&E Television Networks, which were included in net cash provided by operating activities. In 2011, proceeds from sales of businesses and investments were primarily related to the sale of the Philadelphia 76ers.
Return of Capital from Investees In 2013, return of capital from investees consisted primarily of a distribution received from The Weather Channel Holding Corp. (The Weather Channel). In 2012, return of capital from investees consisted primarily of distributions received from the SpectrumCo transaction. Our return of capital from investees in 2011 was not significant.
Purchases of Investments In 2013, purchases of investments related primarily to equity securities that were held as collateral for our prepaid forward sale agreements. Our purchases of investments in 2012 and 2011 were not significant.
Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of our acquisition of GEs remaining 49% common equity interest in NBCUniversal Holdings, repayments of debt, repurchases of our common stock, dividend payments and the effective settlement of our Station Venture liability, which were partially offset by proceeds from borrowings and issuances of common stock. Proceeds from borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on the amounts paid to fund acquisitions and debt repayments.
In January 2013, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.850% senior notes due 2023, $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.250% senior notes due 2033 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior notes due 2043. In March 2013, in connection with the Redemption Transaction, we consolidated an additional $4 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued by NBCUniversal Enterprise and $1.25 billion of borrowings under the NBCUniversal Enterprise credit facility.
During 2013, we repaid $2.3 billion aggregate principal amount of our debt outstanding at maturity.
We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions.
See Note 9 to Comcasts consolidated financial statements for additional information on our financing activities, including details of our debt repayments and borrowings, and long-term debt incurred in connection with the Redemption Transaction, including the debt issued by NBCUniversal Enterprise, which we now consolidate.
69 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents Share Repurchases and Dividends In 2013, we repurchased 49million shares of our ClassA Special common stock for $2.0 billion. As of December31, 2013, we had $1.5 billion remaining under this authorization.
In January 2014, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to $7.5 billion, which does not have an expiration date. Under this authorization, we may repurchase shares in the open market or in private transactions. We intend to repurchase $3 billion of shares during 2014, subject to market conditions.
Our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $2.0 billion in 2013. We paid dividends of $2.0 billion in 2013. In January 2014, our Board of Directors approved a 15% increase in our dividend to $0.90 per share on an annualized basis and approved our first quarter dividend of $0.225 per share to be paid in April 2014. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.
The table below sets forth information on our share repurchases and dividends paid in 2013, 2012 and 2011.
Contractual Obligations The table below presents our future contractual obligations as of December31, 2013 by the period in which the payments are due.
Payment Due by Period (in millions) Total Year 1 Years 2-3 Years 4-5 Morethan5 Debt obligations (a) $ 47,810 $ 3,273 $ 6,910 $ 7,946 $ 29,681 Capital lease obligations 37 7 11 5 14 Operating lease obligations 2,144 385 628 458 673 Purchase obligations (b) 46,867 8,434 9,488 7,573 21,372 Other long-term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet (c) 10,184 3,674 1,757 814 3,939 Total (d) $ 107,042 $ 15,773 $ 18,794 $ 16,796 $ 55,679 Refer to Note 9 (long-term debt) and Note 18 (commitments and contingencies) to our consolidated financial statements.
(a) Excludes interest payments.
(b) Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are legally binding on us and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and price provisions. Our purchase obligations related to our Cable Communications segment include programming contracts with cable networks and local broadcast television stations, contracts with customer premise equipment manufacturers, communication vendors and multichannel video providers for which we provide advertising sales representation, and other contracts entered into in the normal course of business. Cable Communications programming contracts in the table above include amounts payable under fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments and do not represent the total fees that are expected to be paid under programming contracts, which we expect to be higher because these contracts are generally based on Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 70 Table of Contents the number of subscribers receiving the programming. Our purchase obligations related to our NBCUniversal segments consist primarily of commitments to acquire film and television programming, including U.S. television rights to future Olympic Games through 2020, Sunday Night Football on NBC through the 2022-23 season, including the Super Bowl in 2015, 2018 and 2021, NHL games through the 2020-21 season, Spanish-language U.S. television rights to FIFA World Cup games through 2022, U.S television rights to English Premier League soccer games through the 2015-16 season, certain PGA TOUR golf events through 2021 and certain NASCAR events through 2024, as well as obligations under various creative talent and employment agreements, including obligations to actors, producers, television personalities and executives, and various other television commitments. Purchase obligations do not include contracts with immaterial future commitments.
(c) Other long-term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet consist primarily of prepaid forward sale agreements of equity securities we hold; subsidiary preferred shares; deferred compensation obligations; pension, postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations; contingent consideration obligation related to the NBCUniversal transaction; and a contractual obligation acquired in connection with the Universal Orlando transaction. This contractual obligation involves financial interests held by a third party in certain NBCUniversal businesses and is based on a percentage of future revenue of the specified businesses. This contractual obligation provides the third party with the option, beginning in 2017, to require NBCUniversal to purchase the interest for cash in an amount equal to the fair value of the estimated future payments. Reserves for uncertain tax positions of $1.7 billion are not included in the table above because it is uncertain if and when these reserves will become payable. Payments of $1.6 billion of participations and residuals are also not included in the table above because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which these obligations will be settled.
(d) Total contractual obligations are made up of the following components.
(in millions) Liabilities recorded on the balance sheet $ 59,410 Commitments not recorded on the balance sheet 47,632 Total $ 107,042 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December31, 2013, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights, theaccounting for film and television costs, and the accounting for income taxes are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them, which are presented below. See Notes 8, 5 and 15 to Comcasts consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these items.
Valuation and Impairment Testing of Cable Franchise Rights Our largest asset, our cable franchise rights, results from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area. The value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services, such as advanced video services and high-speed Internet and voice services, in a particular service area. The amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions. Typically when we acquire a cable system, the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights. Often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas. We currently serve approximately 6,400 franchise areas in the United States.
71 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents We have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. Accordingly, we do not amortize our cable franchise rights but assess the carrying value of our cable franchise rights annually, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the fair value (impairment testing).
For the purpose of our impairment testing, we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our three Cable Communications divisions or units of account. We evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level.
The annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles allows for the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible is less than its carrying amount. An entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. If it is determined, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of a reporting unit is, more likely than not, less than its carrying value, the quantitative impairment test is required. When performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment. When analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information.
In 2013, we performed a qualitative assessment of our cable franchise rights. We considered various factors that would affect the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights, including changes in our projected future cash flows associated with our Cable Communications segment, industry, market and macroeconomic conditions and also the 27% increase in our market capitalization since we performed our 2012 quantitative assessment. In addition, we considered the results of our 2012 quantitative assessment, in which the estimated fair values of our franchise rights exceeded the carrying value in our three Cable Communications Divisions by 19%, 33% and 37%, respectively. We also compared our weighted average cost of capital in 2013 to that used in our 2012 quantitative assessment and it had remained relatively consistent. Based on our 2013 qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our franchise rights were higher than our carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required.
Since the adoption of the accounting guidance related to goodwill and intangible assets in 2002, we have not recorded any significant impairment charges to cable franchise rights as a result of our impairment testing. A future change in the unit of account could result in the recognition of an impairment charge.
We could also record impairment charges in the future if there are changes in long-term market conditions, in expected future operating results, or in federal or state regulations that prevent us from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise rights. Assumptions made about increased competition and economic conditions could also impact the results of any qualitative assessment and the valuations used in future annual quantitative impairment testing and result in a reduction in the fair values of our cable franchise rights.
Film and Television Costs We capitalize film and television production costs, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest. We amortize capitalized film and television production costs, including acquired libraries, and accrue costs associated with participation and residual payments to programming and production expense. We generally record the amortization and the accrued costs using the individual film forecast computation method, which amortizes such costs using the ratio of the current periods revenue to estimated total remaining gross revenue from all sources (ultimate revenue). Estimates of ultimate revenue have a significant impact on how quickly capitalized costs are amortized and, therefore, are updated regularly.
Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 72 Table of Contents Our estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a films initial release. These estimates are based on the historical performance of similar content, as well as factors unique to the content itself. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the films theatrical performance, as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance. Upon a films release, our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets, including home entertainment and other distribution platforms, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.
With respect to television series or other owned television programming, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license. Initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode under the initial license. Once it is determined that a series can be licensed for subsequent platforms, revenue estimates for these platforms, such as U.S. and international syndication, home entertainment, and other distribution platforms, are included in ultimate revenue. In the case of television series and owned television programming, revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or, if still in production, 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later.
Capitalized film and television costs, as well as stage play production costs, are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified. If the fair value of a production falls below its unamortized cost, we would record an adjustment for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the productions fair value. The fair value assessment is generally based on estimated future discounted cash flows, which are supported by our internal forecasts. Adjustments to capitalized film and stage play production costs of $167 million and $161 million were recorded in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Income Taxes We base our provision for income taxes on our current period income, changes in our deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax rates, changes in estimates of our uncertain tax positions, and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations.
From time to time, we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty. In these cases, we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and the measurement attribute in accordance with the accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions. Examples of these transactions include business acquisitions and dispositions, including consideration paid or received in connection with these transactions, and certain financing transactions. Significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions. We determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained on examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statements.The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved.
We adjust our estimates periodically to reflect changes in circumstances in ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and precedent. We believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes. When uncertain tax positions are ultimately 73 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents resolved, either individually or in the aggregate, differences between our estimated amounts and the actual amounts are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flow for any one period. As of December31, 2013, our uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest were $1.7 billion and $780 million, respectively.
Item7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk Management We maintain a mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt and we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates. In order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt, we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policies.
We monitor our exposure to the risk of adverse changes in interest rates through the use of techniques that include market value and sensitivity analyses. We do not engage in any speculative or leveraged derivative transactions.
Our interest rate derivative financial instruments, which may include swaps, rate locks, caps and collars, represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program. Our interest rate derivative financial instruments reduced the portion of Comcasts total consolidated debt at fixed rates as of December31, 2013 to 83.5% from 91.5%. NBCUniversals interest rate derivative financial instruments reduced the portion of NBCUniversals total consolidated debt at fixed rates as of December31, 2013 to 93.2% from 99.9%.
In 2013, 2012 and 2011, the effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments was to decrease Comcasts consolidated interest expense by $98 million, $106 million and $136 million, respectively. The effect of NBCUniversals interest rate derivative financial instruments was not material to NBCUniversals consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Interest rate derivative financial instruments may have a significant effect on Comcasts interest expense in the future.
The table below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of December31, 2013.

Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 74 Table of Contents We use the notional amount of each interest rate derivative financial instrument to calculate the interest to be paid or received. The notional amounts do not represent our exposure to credit loss. The estimated fair value approximates the amount of payments to be made or proceeds to be received to settle the outstanding contracts, including accrued interest. We estimate interest rates on variable rate debt and swaps using the average implied forward LIBOR through the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on December31, 2013, plus the applicable borrowing margin on December31, 2013.
Certain of our financial contracts include credit-ratings-based triggers that could affect our liquidity. In the ordinary course of business, some of Comcasts swaps could be subject to termination provisions if it does not maintain investment grade credit ratings. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, the estimated fair value of those swaps was not material. The amount to be paid or received upon termination, if any, would be based on the fair value of the outstanding contracts at that time.
See Note 2 to each of the Comcast and NBCUniversal consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments.
Foreign Exchange Risk Management NBCUniversal has significant operations in a number of countries outside the United States, and certain of NBCUniversals operations are conducted in foreign currencies. The value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the U.S. dollar. These changes could adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of our non-U.S. revenue and operating costs and expenses and reduce international demand for our content, all of which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in a given period or in specific territories.
As part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, NBCUniversal enters into derivative financial instruments related to a significant portion of its foreign currency exposures. NBCUniversal enters into foreign currency forward contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the U.S. dollar equivalent value of its foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments, and forecasted foreign currency revenue and expenses. In accordance with our policy, NBCUniversal hedges forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed 18months. In certain circumstances NBCUniversal enters into foreign exchange contracts with initial maturities in excess of 18 months. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, NBCUniversal had foreign exchange contracts with a total notional value of $968 million and $820 million, respectively. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, the aggregate estimated fair value of these foreign exchange contracts was not material.
We have analyzed our foreign currency exposures related to NBCUniversals operations as of December31, 2013, including our hedging contracts, to identify assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency. For these assets and liabilities, we then evaluated the effect of a 10% shift in currency exchange rates between those currencies and the U.S. dollar. The analysis of such shift in exchange rates indicated that there would be an immaterial effect on our 2013 income.
Comcast is also exposed to the market risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as they relate to its foreign currency denominated debt obligations. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert fixed-rate foreign currency denominated debt to fixed-rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, in order to hedge the risk that the cash flows related to annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The gains and losses on the cross-currency swaps offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, the fair value of our cross-currency swaps on our 625million principal amount of 5.50% senior notes due 2029 was an asset of $73 million and $30 million, respectively.
75 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents Equity Price Risk Management Comcast is exposed to the market risk of changes in the equity prices of its investments in marketable securities. Comcast enters into various derivative transactions in accordance with its policies to manage the volatility related to these exposures.Through market value and sensitivity analyses, Comcast monitors its equity price risk exposures to ensure that the instruments are matched with the underlying assets or liabilities, reduce its risks relating to equity prices, and maintain a high correlation to the risk inherent in the hedged item.
To limit Comcasts exposure to and the benefits from price fluctuations in the common stock of some of its investments, it uses equity derivative financial instruments. These derivative financial instruments, which are accounted for at fair value, may include equity collar agreements, prepaid forward sale agreements and indexed debt instruments.
In 2013 and 2012, the changes in the fair value of the investments that Comcast accounted for as available-for-sale or trading securities were substantially offset by the changes in the fair values of the equity derivative financial instruments. See Note 6 to Comcasts consolidated financial statements for additional information on its investments and investment income (loss), net.
Counterparty Credit Risk Management Comcast and NBCUniversal manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through diversification and the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties. Although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties, we do not expect such losses, if any, to be significant. Comcast has agreements with certain counterparties that include collateral provisions. These provisions require a party with an aggregate unrealized loss position in excess of certain thresholds to post cash collateral for the amount in excess of the threshold. The threshold levels in our collateral agreements are based on our and the counterparties credit ratings. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, Comcast was not required to post collateral under the terms of these agreements. As of December31, 2013, the collateral that Comcast held from certain of its counterparties under the terms of these agreements was not material.

77 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents Report of Management Managements Report on Comcasts Financial Statements Our management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of information in Comcasts consolidated financial statements, including estimates and judgments. The consolidated financial statements presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our management believes the Comcast consolidated financial statements and other financial information included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, Comcasts financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in this report. The Comcast consolidated financial statements have been audited by Deloitte& Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.
Managements Report on Comcasts Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting. Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets.
Provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors.
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. Our system contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.
Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued in 1992 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that Comcasts system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2013. The effectiveness of Comcasts internal controls over financial reporting of Comcast has been audited by Deloitte& Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.
Audit Committee Oversight The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is comprised solely of independent directors, has oversight responsibility for our financial reporting process and the audits of Comcasts consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee meets regularly with management and with our internal auditors and independent registered public accounting firm (collectively, the auditors) to review matters related to the quality and integrity of our financial reporting, internal control over financial reporting (including compliance matters related to our Code of Conduct), and the nature, extent, and results of internal and external audits. Our auditors have full and free access and report directly to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee recommended, and the Board of Directors approved, that the Comcast audited consolidated financial statements be included in this Form 10-K.
Brian L. Roberts Michael J. Angelakis Lawrence J. Salva Chairmanand Chief Executive Officer Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer Senior Vice President, Chief AccountingOfficer andController Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 78 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Comcast Corporation Philadelphia, Pennsylvania We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Comcast Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2013. We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Comcasts Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Comcast Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 84 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1: Business and Basis of Presentation We are a global media and technology company with two primary businesses, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal. We were incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania in December 2001. Through our predecessors, we have developed, managed and operated cable systems since 1963. In 2011, we closed the NBCUniversal transaction in which we acquired control of the businesses of NBCUniversal Media, LLC (NBCUniversal), and in 2013, we acquired GEs remaining 49% common equity interest in NBCUniversal.
We present our operations for Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications, and our operations for NBCUniversal in four reportable business segments. The Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks segments comprise the NBCUniversal businesses and are collectively referred to as the NBCUniversal segments. See Note 19 for additional information on our reportable business segments.
Our Cable Communications segment primarily manages and operates cable systems that serve residential and business customers in the United States. As of December31, 2013, we served 21.7million video customers, 20.7million high-speed Internet customers and 10.7million voice customers.
Our Cable Networks segment consists primarily of a diversified portfolio of cable television networks. Our cable networks are comprised of our national cable networks, which provide a variety of entertainment, news and information and sports content, our regional sports and news networks, our international cable networks, and our cable television production operations.
Our Broadcast Television segment consists primarily of the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks, our NBC and Telemundo owned local television stations, and our broadcast television production operations.
Our Filmed Entertainment segment primarily produces, acquires, markets and distributes filmed entertainment worldwide. Our films are produced primarily under the Universal Pictures, Focus Features and Illumination names.
Our Theme Parks segment consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando and Hollywood. We also receive fees from third parties that own and operate Universal Studios Japan and Universal Studios Singapore for intellectual property licenses and other services.
Our other business interests primarily include Comcast-Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia and operates arena management-related businesses.
Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all entities in which we have a controlling voting interest (subsidiaries) and variable interest entities (VIEs) required to be consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP).
We translate assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is the local currency, primarily the euro and the British pound, into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect as of the balance sheet date. The related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We translate revenue and expenses using average monthly exchange rates, and the related foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in our consolidated statement of income.
Reclassifications Reclassifications have been made to our consolidated financial statements for the prior years to conform to classifications used in 2013.
85 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Note 2: Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to select accounting policies, including in certain cases industry-specific policies, and make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We believe the judgments and related estimates for the following items are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:  valuation and impairment testing of cable franchise rights (see Note 8)  film and television costs (see Note 5)  income taxes (see Note 15) In addition, the following accounting policies are specific to the industries in which we operate:  capitalization and amortization of film and television costs (see Note 5)  customer installation costs in our Cable Communications segment (see Note 7) Information on our other accounting policies or methods related to our consolidated financial statements are included, where applicable, in their respective footnotes that follow. Below is a discussion of accounting policies and methods used in our consolidated financial statements that are not presented within other footnotes.
Revenue Recognition Cable Communications Segment Our Cable Communications segment generates revenue primarily from subscriptions to our video, high-speed Internet and voice services (cable services) and from the sale of advertising. We recognize revenue from cable services as each service is provided. Customers are typically billed in advance on a monthly basis. We manage credit risk by screening applicants through the use of internal customer information, identification verification tools and credit bureau data. If a customers account is delinquent, various measures are used to collect outstanding amounts, including termination of the customers cable services. Since installation revenue obtained from the connection of customers to our cable systems is less than related direct selling costs, we recognize revenue as connections are completed.
As part of our distribution agreements with cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that we sell to local, regional and national advertisers. We recognize advertising revenue when the advertising is aired. In most cases, the available advertising time is sold by our sales force. In some cases, we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising time allocated to us. We also represent the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers in some markets. Since we are acting as the principal in these arrangements, we report the advertising that is sold as revenue and the fees paid to representation firms and multichannel video providers as other operating and administrative expenses.
Revenue earned from other sources is recognized when services are provided or events occur. Under the terms of our cable franchise agreements, we are generally required to pay to the franchising authority an amount based on our gross video revenue. We normally pass these fees through to our cable customers and classify the fees as a component of revenue with the corresponding costs included in other operating and administrative expenses.
Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 86 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Cable Networks and Broadcast Television Segments Our Cable Networks segment generates revenue primarily from the distribution of our cable network programming to multichannel video providers, the sale of advertising and the licensing of our owned programming. Our Broadcast Television segment generates revenue primarily from the sale of advertising, the licensing of our owned programming and the fees received under retransmission consent agreements. We recognize revenue from distributors as programming is provided, generally under multiyear distribution agreements. From time to time, the distribution agreements expire while programming continues to be provided to the distributor based on interim arrangements while the parties negotiate new contract terms. Revenue recognition is generally limited to current payments being made by the distributor, typically under the prior contract terms, until a new contract is negotiated, sometimes with effective dates that affect prior periods. Differences between actual amounts determined upon resolution of negotiations and amounts recorded during these interim arrangements are recorded in the period of resolution.
Advertising revenue for our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments is recognized in the period in which commercials are aired or viewed. In some instances, we guarantee viewer ratings for the commercials. To the extent there is a shortfall in the ratings that were guaranteed, a portion of the revenue is deferred until the shortfall is settled, primarily by providing additional advertising time. We record revenue from the licensing of our owned programming when the content is available for use by the licensee, and when certain other conditions are met. When license fees include advertising time, we recognize the advertising time component of revenue when the advertisements are aired or viewed.
Filmed Entertainment Segment Our Filmed Entertainment segment generates revenue primarily from the worldwide distribution of our owned and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters, the licensing of our owned and acquired films to cable, broadcast and premium networks and digital distributors, and the sale of our owned and acquired films on both standard-definition DVDs and Blu-ray discs (together, DVDs) and through digital distributors. We also generate revenue from producing and licensing live stage plays and distributing filmed entertainment produced by third parties. We recognize revenue from the distribution of films to movie theaters when the films are exhibited. We record revenue from the licensing of a film when the film is available for use by the licensee, and when certain other conditions are met. We recognize revenue from DVD sales, net of estimated returns and customer incentives, on the date that DVDs are delivered to and made available for sale by retailers.
Theme Parks Segment Our Theme Parks segment generates revenue primarily from theme park attendance and per capita spending at our Universal theme parks in Orlando and Hollywood, as well as from licensing and other fees. We recognize revenue from advance theme park ticket sales when the tickets are used. For annual passes, we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the annual period following the initial redemption date.
Cable Communications Programming Expenses Cable Communications programming expenses are the fees we pay to license the programming we distribute to our video customers. Programming is acquired for distribution to our video customers, generally under multiyear distribution agreements, with rates typically based on the number of customers that receive the programming, adjusted for channel positioning and the extent of distribution. From time to time these contracts expire and programming continues to be provided under interim arrangements while the parties negotiate new contractual terms, sometimes with effective dates that affect prior periods. While payments are typically made under the prior contracts terms, the amount of programming expenses recorded during these interim arrangements is based on our estimates of the ultimate contractual terms expected to be negotiated. Differences between actual amounts determined upon resolution of negotiations and amounts recorded during these interim arrangements are recorded in the period of resolution.
87 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents Comcast Corporation When our Cable Communications segment receives incentives from cable networks for the licensing of their programming, we defer a portion of these incentives, which are included in other current and noncurrent liabilities, and recognize them over the term of the contract as a reduction to programming and production expenses.
Advertising Expenses Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Cash Equivalents The carrying amounts of our cash equivalents approximate their fair value. Our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds and U.S. government obligations, as well as commercial paper and certificates of deposit with maturities of less than three months when purchased.
Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. Our objective is to manage the financial and operational exposure arising from these risks by offsetting gains and losses on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivatives used to economically hedge them.
Our derivative financial instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value. See Note 6 for additional information on the derivative component of our prepaid forward sale agreements. The impact of our other derivative financial instruments on our consolidated financial statements was not material for all periods presented.
Asset Retirement Obligations Certain of our cable franchise agreements and lease agreements contain provisions requiring us to restore facilities or remove property in the event that the franchise or lease agreement is not renewed. We expect to continually renew our cable franchise agreements and therefore cannot reasonably estimate any liabilities associated with such agreements. A remote possibility exists that franchise agreements could be terminated unexpectedly, which could result in us incurring significant expense in complying with restoration or removal provisions. The disposal obligations related to our properties are not material to our consolidated financial statements. We do not have any significant liabilities related to asset retirements recorded in our consolidated financial statements.
Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 88 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Note 3: Earnings Per Share Computation of Diluted EPS 2013 2012 2011 Year ended December31 (in millions, except per share data) Net Income Attributable to Comcast Corporation Shares PerShare Amount Net Income Attributable to Comcast Corporation Shares PerShare Amount Net Income Attributable to Comcast Corporation Shares PerShare Amount Basic EPS attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders $ 6,816 2,625 $ 2.60 $ 6,203 2,678 $ 2.32 $ 4,160 2,746 $ 1.51 Effect of dilutive securities: Assumed exercise or issuance of shares relating to stock plans 40 39 32 Diluted EPS attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders $ 6,816 2,665 $ 2.56 $ 6,203 2,717 $ 2.28 $ 4,160 2,778 $ 1.50 Our potentially dilutive securities include potential common shares related to our stock options and our restricted share units (RSUs). Diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders (diluted EPS) considers the impact of potentially dilutive securities using the treasury stock method. Diluted EPS excludes the impact of potential common shares related to our stock options in periods in which the combination of the option exercise price and the associated unrecognized compensation expense is greater than the average market price of our ClassA common stock or our ClassA Special common stock, as applicable.
Diluted EPS for 2011 excluded 45million of potential common shares related to our share-based compensation plans, because the inclusion of the potential common shares would have had an antidilutive effect. These amounts were not material for 2013 and 2012.
Note 4: Significant Transactions 2013 Redemption Transaction On March19, 2013, we acquired GEs remaining 49% common equity interest in NBCUniversal, LLC (NBCUniversal Holdings) for approximately $16.7 billion (the Redemption Transaction). In addition to this transaction, NBCUniversal purchased from GE certain properties NBCUniversal occupies at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City and CNBCs headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey for $1.4 billion.
The total consideration for these transactions consisted of $11.4 billion of cash on hand; $4 billion of senior debt securities issued by NBCUniversal Enterprise, Inc. (NBCUniversal Enterprise), a holding company that we control and consolidate following the close of the Redemption Transaction whose principal assets are its interests in NBCUniversal Holdings; $750 million of cash funded through our commercial paper program; $1.25 billion of borrowings under NBCUniversal Enterprises credit facility, which replaced NBCUniversals credit facility; and $725 million aggregate liquidation preference of Series A cumulative preferred stock of NBCUniversal Enterprise. See Note 9 for additional information on NBCUniversal Enterprises senior debt securities and credit facility and Note 21 for additional information on our cross-guarantee structure.
89 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents Comcast Corporation The NBCUniversal Enterprise preferred stock is now held by unaffiliated third parties and pays dividends at a fixed rate of 5.25%per annum. The holders have the right to cause NBCUniversal Enterprise to redeem their shares at a price equal to the liquidation preference plus accrued but unpaid dividends for a 30 day period beginning on March19, 2020 and thereafter on every third anniversary of such date (each such date, a put date). Shares of preferred stock can be called for redemption by NBCUniversal Enterprise at a price equal to the liquidation preference plus accrued but unpaid dividends one year following each put date applicable to such shares. Because certain of these redemption provisions are outside of our control, the NBCUniversal Enterprise preferred stock is presented outside of equity under the caption redeemable noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in our consolidated balance sheet. Its initial value was based on the liquidation preference of the preferred stock and is adjusted for accrued but unpaid dividends. As of December31, 2013, the fair value of the redeemable subsidiary preferred stock was $741 million. The estimated fair value was based on Level 2 inputs using pricing models whose inputs are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
We recognized an increase to our deferred tax liabilities of $1.6 billion primarily due to an increase in our financial reporting basis in the consolidated net assets of NBCUniversal Holdings in excess of the tax basis following the Redemption Transaction. In addition, our consolidated balance sheet now includes certain tax liabilities of NBCUniversal Enterprise related to periods prior to our acquisition of the common stock of NBCUniversal Enterprise for which we have been indemnified by GE and have recorded a related indemnification asset. We also expect to realize additional tax benefits in the future as a result of the Redemption Transaction, which are expected to increase the amounts we have agreed to share with GE. Our expected future payments to GE are accounted for as contingent consideration. See Note 10 for additional information on the fair value of this contingent consideration as of December31, 2013.
Because we maintained control of NBCUniversal Holdings, the difference between the consideration transferred and the recorded value of GEs 49% redeemable noncontrolling common equity interest, and the related tax impacts, were recorded to additional paid-in capital.
2011 NBCUniversal Transaction On January28, 2011, we closed our transaction with GE in which we acquired a 51% controlling interest in NBCUniversal Holdings. As part of the NBCUniversal transaction, GE contributed the businesses of NBCUniversal, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of NBCUniversal Holdings. We contributed our national cable networks, our regional sports and news networks, certain of our Internet businesses and other related assets (the Comcast Content Business). In addition to contributing the Comcast Content Business, we also made a cash payment to GE of $6.2 billion, which included transaction-related costs.
In 2011, we recorded $10.9 billion of goodwill in our allocation of purchase price for the NBCUniversal transaction, which was allocated to our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments. Due to the partnership structure of NBCUniversal Holdings, goodwill related to the NBCUniversal transaction is not deductible for tax purposes. In addition, we also recorded $576 million of deferred tax liabilities in connection with the NBCUniversal transaction, as well as an additional $35 million of net deferred income tax liabilities in the allocation of purchase price.See Note 15 for additional information on the partnership structure of NBCUniversal Holdings and NBCUniversal and other related income tax matters.
Because we maintained control of the Comcast Content Business, the excess of the fair value received over the historical book value and the related tax impact were recorded to additional paid-in capital.
Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 90 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation We agreed to share with GE certain tax benefits as they are realized that relate to the form and structure of the transaction. These payments to GE are contingent on us realizing tax benefits in the future and are accounted for as contingent consideration. See Note 10 for additional information on our contingent consideration liability.
Universal Orlando Transaction On July1, 2011, NBCUniversal acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in Universal Orlando that it did not already own for $1 billion. Following the close of the transaction, Universal Orlando is a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary of NBCUniversal, and its operations are reported in our Theme Parks segment. We recorded $982 million of goodwill in our allocation of purchase price for this transaction, which was fully allocated to our Theme Parks segment.
Note 5: Film and Television Costs December31 (in millions) 2013 2012 Film Costs: Released, less amortization $ 1,630 $ 1,472 Completed, not released 70 99 In production and in development 658 1,048 2,358 2,619 Television Costs: Released, less amortization 1,155 1,124 In production and in development 370 334 1,525 1,458 Programming rights, less amortization 2,039 1,886 5,922 5,963 Less: Current portion of programming rights 928 909 Film and television costs $ 4,994 $ 5,054 Based on our estimates of the ratio of the current periods actual revenue to the estimated total remaining gross revenue from all sources (ultimate revenue), as of December31, 2013, approximately $1.3 billion of film and television costs associated with our original film and television productions that have been released, or completed and not yet released, are expected to be amortized during 2014. Approximately 85% of unamortized film and television costs for our released productions, excluding amounts allocated to acquired libraries, are expected to be amortized through 2016.
As of December31, 2013, acquired film and television libraries, which are included within the released, less amortization captions in the table above, had remaining unamortized costs of $711 million. These costs are generally amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years, and approximately 49% of these costs are expected to be amortized through 2016.
Capitalization of Film and Television Costs We capitalize film and television production costs, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest. We amortize capitalized film and television production costs, including acquired libraries, and accrue costs associated with participation and residual payments to programming and production expense. We generally record the amortization and the accrued costs using the individual film forecast computation method, which amortizes such costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate rev- 91 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents Comcast Corporation enue. Estimates of total revenue and total costs are based on anticipated release patterns, public acceptance and historical results for similar productions. Unamortized film and television costs, including acquired film and television libraries, are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. We do not capitalize costs related to the distribution of a film to movie theaters or the licensing or sale of a film or television production, which are primarily costs associated with the marketing and distribution of film and television programming.
In determining the estimated lives and method of amortization of acquired film and television libraries, we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset.
Upon the occurrence of an event or a change in circumstance that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of a film is less than its unamortized costs, we determine the fair value of the film and record an impairment charge for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the films fair value.
We enter into arrangements with third parties to jointly finance and distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements, which are referred to as cofinancing arrangements, can take various forms. In most cases, the arrangement involves the grant of an economic interest in a film to a third-party investor. The number of investors and the terms of these arrangements can vary, although in most cases an investor assumes full risk for the portion of the film acquired in these arrangements. We account for the proceeds received from a third-party investor under these arrangements as a reduction to our capitalized film costs. In these arrangements, the investor owns an undivided copyright interest in the film and, therefore, in each period we record either a charge or a benefit to programming and production expense to reflect the estimate of the third-party investors interest in the profit or loss of the film. The estimate of the third-party investors interest in the profit or loss of a film is determined using the ratio of actual revenue earned to date to the ultimate revenue expected to be recognized over the films useful life.
We capitalize the costs of programming content that we license but do not own, including rights to multiyear live-event sports programming, at the earlier of when payments are made for the programming or when the license period begins and the content is available for use. We amortize capitalized programming costs as the associated programs are broadcast. We amortize multiyear, live-event sports programming rights using the ratio of the current periods revenue to the estimated total remaining revenue or under the terms of the contract.
Acquired programming costs are recorded at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value on a program by program, package, channel or daypart basis. A daypart is an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. Acquired programming used in our Cable Networks segment is primarily tested on a channel basis for impairment, whereas acquired programming used in our Broadcast Television segment is tested on a daypart basis. If we determine that the estimates of future cash flows are insufficient or if there is no plan to broadcast certain programming, we recognize an impairment charge to programming and production expense.

For AFS securities, we record unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value between measurement dates as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), except when we consider declines in value to be other than temporary. For trading securities, we record unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value between measurement dates as a component of investment income (loss), net. We recognize realized gains and losses associated with our fair value method investments using the specific identification method. We classify the cash flows related to purchases of and proceeds from the sale of trading securities based on the nature of the securities and the purpose for which they were acquired.
93 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents Comcast Corporation As of December31, 2013 and 2012, the majority of our fair value method investments were equity securities that we account for as trading securities and were held as collateral related to our obligations under prepaid forward sale agreements.
Prepaid Forward Sale Agreements December 31 (in millions) 2013 2012 Assets: Fair value equity securities held as collateral $ 3,959 $ 4,143 Liabilities: Obligations under prepaid forward sale agreements $ 811 $ 1,248 Derivative component of prepaid forward sale agreements 2,800 2,302 Total liabilities $ 3,611 $ 3,550 During 2013, we purchased a total of $657 million of equity securities classified as trading securities and held them as collateral under our prepaid forward sale agreements. We also settled obligations under certain of our prepaid forward sale agreements totaling $1.6 billion with a combination of cash on hand and $1.4 billion of equity securities. The majority of our remaining obligations related to these investments mature in 2014. At maturity, the counterparties are entitled to receive some or all of the equity securities, or an equivalent amount of cash at our option, based on the market value of the equity securities at that time. As of both December31, 2013 and 2012, our prepaid forward sale obligations had an estimated fair value of $3.6 billion. The estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs using pricing models whose inputs are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
The derivative component of the prepaid forward sale agreements are equity derivative financial instruments embedded in the related contracts, which we use to manage our exposure to and benefits from price fluctuations in the common stock of the related investments. For these derivative financial instruments, we separate the derivative component from the host contract and record the change in its value each period to investment income (loss), net.
Liberty Media In October 2013, Liberty Media Corporation (Liberty Media) redeemed 6.3million shares of Liberty Media Series A common stock (Liberty stock) that had been held by us as collateral as of December31, 2012 under certain of our prepaid forward sale agreements in exchange for all of the equity of a subsidiary of Liberty Media. The fair value of the Liberty stock at the date of the close of the transaction was $937 million. The assets of the subsidiary of Liberty Media included cash of $417 million, Liberty Medias interests in one of NBCUniversals contractual obligations and a wholly owned operating subsidiary, Leisure Arts, Inc. Following the close of this transaction, we now consolidate the subsidiary transferred to us, and the liability associated with NBCUniversals contractual obligation is eliminated in consolidation.
Clearwire LLC In July 2013, in connection with Sprint Communications, Inc.s (Sprint) acquisition of Clearwire Corporation (Clearwire), Sprint acquired our investment of 89million ClassA shares of Clearwire for $443 million. As a result, we recognized a pretax gain of $443 million in our consolidated statement of income, which represented the recognition of cumulative unrealized gains previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 94 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Equity Method We use the equity method to account for investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investees operating and financial policies or where we hold significant partnership or LLC interests. Equity method investments are recorded at cost and are adjusted to recognize (i)our proportionate share of the investees net income or losses after the date of investment, (ii)amortization of the recorded investment that exceeds our share of the book value of the investees net assets, (iii)additional contributions made and dividends received and (iv)impairments resulting from other-than-temporary declines in fair value. For some investments, we record our share of the investees net income or loss one quarter in arrears due to the timing of our receipt of such information. Gains or losses on the sale of equity method investments are recorded to other income (expense), net. If an equity method investee were to issue additional securities that would change our proportionate share of the entity, we would recognize the change, if any, as a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of income.
The Weather Channel In June 2013, we received a distribution from The Weather Channel Holding Corp. (The Weather Channel) of $152 million, of which $128 million was recorded as a return of its investment in The Weather Channel and included under the caption return of capital from investees in our consolidated statement of cash flows.
Hulu In July 2013, we entered into an agreement to provide capital contributions totaling $247 million to Hulu, LLC (Hulu), which we had previously accounted for as a cost method investment. This represented an agreement to provideour first capital contribution to Hulu since our interest was acquired as part of the NBCUniversal transaction, therefore we began to apply the equity method of accounting for this investment. The change in the method of accounting for this investment required us to recognize our proportionate share of Hulus accumulated losses from the date of the NBCUniversal transaction through July 2013.
Cost Method We use the cost method to account for investments not accounted for under the fair value method or the equity method.
AirTouch Communications, Inc.
We hold two series of preferred stock of AirTouch Communications, Inc. (AirTouch), a subsidiary of Vodafone, which are redeemable in April 2020. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, the estimated fair value of the AirTouch preferred stock was $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.
The dividend and redemption activity of the AirTouch preferred stock determines the dividend and redemption payments associated with substantially all of the preferred shares issued by one of our consolidated subsidiaries, which is a VIE. The subsidiary has three series of preferred stock outstanding with an aggregate redemption value of $1.75 billion. Substantially all of the preferred shares are redeemable in April 2020 at a redemption value of $1.65 billion. As of both December31, 2013 and 2012, the two redeemable series of subsidiary preferred shares were recorded at $1.5 billion, and those amounts are included in other noncurrent liabilities. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, these redeemable subsidiary preferred shares had an estimated fair value of $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. The estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs using pricing models whose inputs are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. The one nonredeemable series of subsidiary preferred shares was recorded at $100 million as of both December31, 2013 and 2012, and those amounts are included in noncontrolling interests in our consolidated balance sheet. The carrying amounts of the nonredeemable subsidiary preferred shares approximate their fair value.
95 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Impairment Testing of Investments We review our investment portfolio each reporting period to determine whether there are identified events or circumstances that would indicate there is a decline in the fair value that would be considered other than temporary. For our nonpublic investments, if there are no identified events or circumstances that would have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment, then the fair value is not estimated. If an investment is deemed to have experienced an other-than-temporary decline below its cost basis, we reduce the carrying amount of the investment to its quoted or estimated fair value, as applicable, and establish a new cost basis for the investment. For our AFS and cost method investments, we record the impairment to investment income (loss), net. For our equity method investments, we record the impairment to other income (expense), net. During 2013, we recorded $249 million of impairment charges to our equity method investments, which were primarily related to a regional sports cable network based in Houston, Texas.

We capitalize improvements that extend asset lives and expense repairs and maintenance costs as incurred. We record depreciation using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful life. For assets that are sold or retired, we remove the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation and, unless the gain or loss on disposition is presented separately, we recognize it as a component of depreciation expense.
We capitalize the costs associated with the construction of and improvements to our cable transmission and distribution facilities, costs associated with acquiring and deploying new customer premise equipment, and costs associated with installation of our services in accordance with accounting guidance related to cable television companies. Costs capitalized include all direct labor and materials, as well as various indirect costs. All costs incurred in connection with subsequent disconnects and reconnects are expensed as they are incurred.
We evaluate the recoverability of our property and equipment whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is based on the cash flows generated by the underlying asset groups, including estimated future operating results, trends or other determinants of fair value. If the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset group, we would recognize an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount of the asset group exceeded its estimated fair value. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of depreciation expense.
Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 96 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Acquisitions of Real Estate Properties Real estate acquisitions for 2013 primarily included NBCUniversals purchase from GE of certain properties NBCUniversal occupies at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City and CNBCs headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. The CNBC property was previously recorded as a capital lease in our consolidated balance sheet. Other acquisitions included NBCUniversals purchase in September 2013 of a business whose primary asset is a property located at 10 Universal City Plaza, which is adjacent to Universal Studios in Hollywood, California, and Comcasts purchase in December 2013 of an 80% interest in a business whose primary asset is our corporate headquarters in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. These purchases resulted in increases of $2.2 billion in property and equipment which are included, as applicable, within the captions buildings and leasehold improvements and land in the table above.

Adjustments to goodwill in 2012 were primarily related to the adjustments to the allocation of purchase price associated with the Universal Orlando transaction in 2011.
We assess the recoverability of our goodwill annually, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. To determine our reporting units, we evaluate the components one level below the segment level and we aggregate the components if they have similar economic characteristics. As a result of this assessment, our reporting units are the same as our five reportable segments. We evaluate the determination of our reporting units used to test for impairment periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. The quantitative assessment considers if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, in which case an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of amortization expense.

Our cable franchise rights represent the values we attributed to agreements with state and local authorities that allow access to homes and businesses in cable service areas acquired in business combinations. We do not amortize our cable franchise rights because we have determined that they meet the definition of indefinite-lived intangible assets since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. We reassess this determination periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. Costs we incur in negotiating and renewing cable franchise agreements are included in other intangible assets and are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the franchise agreement.
We assess the recoverability of our franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. Our three Cable Communications divisions represent the unit of account we use to test for impairment for our cable franchise rights. We evaluate the unit of account used to test for impairment of our cable franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur to ensure impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. When performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment. When analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions, and profitability information. If the fair value of our cable franchise rights or other indefinite-lived intangible assets were less than the carrying amount, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of amortization expense.

Our finite-lived intangible assets are amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life or the term of the respective agreement.
We capitalize direct development costs associated with internal-use software, including external direct costs of material and services and payroll costs for employees devoting time to these software projects. We also capitalize costs associated with the purchase of software licenses. We include these costs in other intangible assets and amortize them on a straight-line basis over a period not to exceed five years. We expense maintenance and training costs, as well as costs incurred during the preliminary stage of a project, as they are incurred. We capitalize initial operating system software costs and amortize them over the life of the associated hardware.
We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is based on the cash flows generated by the underlying asset groups, including estimated future operating results, trends or other determinants of fair value.

The total consideration for the Redemption Transaction also included $750 million of cash funded through our commercial paper program.
The NBCUniversal Enterprise senior notes are comprised of $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.662% senior notes due 2018, $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.974% senior notes due 2019, $700 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2016 and $700 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2018. The floating rate senior notes due 2016 and 2018 will accrue interest for each quarterly interest period at a rate equal to three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.537% and 0.685%, respectively.
On March19, 2013, NBCUniversal Enterprise amended and restated the existing credit agreement of NBCUniversal to, among other things, substitute NBCUniversal Enterprise for NBCUniversal as the sole borrower, reduce the borrowing capacity of the facility from $1.5 billion to $1.35 billion, extend the term of the facility to March 2018 and revise the interest rate on borrowings. The interest rate on the credit facility consists of a Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 100 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation base rate plus a borrowing margin that is determined based on our credit rating. Following the amendments to this credit agreement, NBCUniversals commercial paper program was terminated. As of December31, 2013, $1.25 billion was outstanding under this credit facility.
Debt Instruments Revolving Credit Facilities As of December31, 2013, Comcast and Comcast Cable Communications, LLC had a $6.25 billion revolving credit facility due June 2017 with a syndicate of banks. The interest rate on this facility consists of a base rate plus a borrowing margin that is determined based on our credit rating. As of December31, 2013, the borrowing margin for LIBOR-based borrowings was 1.00%. This revolving credit facility requires that we maintain certain financial ratios based on our debt and our operating income before depreciation and amortization, as defined in the credit facility. We were in compliance with all financial covenants for all periods presented.
As of December31, 2013, amounts available under our consolidated credit facilities, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and outstanding letters of credit, totaled $4.7 billion, which included $100 million available under NBCUniversal Enterprises credit facility.
Commercial Paper Program Our commercial paper program provides a lower cost source of borrowing to fund our short-term working capital requirements and is supported by our $6.25 billion revolving credit facility due June 2017. In September 2013, we increased the borrowing capacity of our commercial paper program from $2.25 billion to $6.25 billion.
Letters of Credit As of December31, 2013, we and certain of our subsidiaries had unused irrevocable standby letters of credit totaling $515 million to cover potential fundings under various agreements.
Note 10: Fair Value Measurements The accounting guidance related to financial assets and financial liabilities (financial instruments) establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach). The levels of the hierarchy are described below.
Level 1: Consists of financial instruments whose values are based on quoted market prices for identical financial instruments in an active market.
Level 2: Consists of financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models use inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include (i)quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, (ii)quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, (iii)pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the financial instrument and (iv)pricing models whose inputs are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
Level 3: Consists of financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models that use significant inputs that are primarily unobservable, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.
101 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of financial instruments and their classification within the fair value hierarchy. Financial instruments are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. There have been no changes in the classification of any financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy in the periods presented. Our financial instruments that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis are presented in the table below.

The most significant unobservable inputs we use are our estimates of the future revenue we expect to generate from certain NBCUniversal entities, which are related to our contractual obligations, and future net tax benefits that will affect payments to GE, which are related to contingent consideration. The discount rates used in the measurements of fair value were between 5% and 13% and are based on the underlying risk associated with our estimate of future revenue, as well as the terms of the respective contracts, and the uncertainty in the timing of our payments to GE. The fair value adjustments to contractual obligations and contingent consideration are sensitive to the assumptions related to future revenue and tax benefits, respectively, as well as to current interest rates, and therefore, the adjustments are recorded to other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income.

In the case of film or stage play production costs, upon the occurrence of an event or change in circumstance that may indicate that the fair value of a production is less than its unamortized costs, we determine the fair value of the production and record an adjustment for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the productions fair value.The estimate of fair value of a production is determined using Level 3 inputs, primarily an analysis of future expected cash flows.Adjustments to capitalized film and stage play production costs of $167 million and $161 million were recorded in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Note 11: Noncontrolling Interests Certain of the subsidiaries that we consolidate are not wholly owned. Some of the agreements with the minority partners of these subsidiaries contain redemption features whereby interests held by the minority partners are redeemable either (i)at the option of the holder or (ii)upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control. If interests were to be redeemed under these agreements, we would generally be required to purchase the interest at fair value on the date of redemption. These interests are presented on the balance sheet outside of equity under the caption redeemable noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock. Noncontrolling interests that do not contain such redemption features are presented in equity.
We acquired GEs remaining 49% common equity interest in NBCUniversal Holdings, which had previously been presented as a redeemable noncontrolling interest in our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 4 for additional information on the Redemption Transaction. The difference between the consideration transferred and the recorded value of GEs 49% redeemable noncontrolling common equity interest, as well as the related tax impacts, were recorded to additional paid-in capital.

(b) We did not recognize service cost in 2013 as our pension plans were frozen. The 2012 and 2011 amounts included service costs related to our pension benefits of $139 million and $99 million, respectively.
Postretirement Benefit Plans We and NBCUniversal sponsor various benefit plans that provide postretirement benefits to eligible employees based on years of service. The Comcast Postretirement Healthcare Stipend Program (the stipend plan) provides an annual stipend for reimbursement of healthcare costs to each eligible employee based on years of service. Under the stipend plans, we are not exposed to the increasing costs of healthcare because the benefits are fixed at a predetermined amount.
NBCUniversals postretirement medical and life insurance plans provide continuous coverage to employees eligible to receive such benefits. A small number of eligible employees also participate in legacy plans of acquired companies.
All of our postretirement benefit plans are unfunded and substantially all of our postretirement benefit obligations are recorded to noncurrent liabilities. The expense we recognize related to our postretirement benefit plans is determined using certain assumptions, including the discount rate.
Pension Plans NBCUniversal NBCUniversal sponsors various domestic qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans for which future benefits were frozen effective December31, 2012. We ceased to recognize service costs associated with these defined benefit plans following the date on which future benefits were frozen. The expense we recognize related to our defined benefit plans is determined using certain assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We recognize the funded or unfunded status of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability in our consolidated balance sheet and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). In the event of a defined benefit plan termination, we expect to fully fund and settle the plan within 180 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 104 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation days of approval by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). In addition to the defined benefit plans it sponsors, NBCUniversal is also obligated to reimburse GE for future benefit payments to those participants who were vested in the supplemental pension plan sponsored by GE at the time of the close of the NBCUniversal transaction.
In October 2013, NBCUniversal provided notice to the plan participants of its qualified pension plan of its intent to terminate its plan effective December31, 2013. The NBCUniversal qualified pension plan was unfunded by $8 million as of December31, 2013, and NBCUniversal expects to seek approval for this termination from the IRS and PBGC in 2014.
Other In August 2013, we settled all of our obligations related to the termination in February 2012 of the qualified pension plan that provided benefits to former employees of a company we acquired as part of the AT&T Broadband transaction in 2002. In connection with this final settlement, we fully funded the plan with additional contributions of $55 million and recorded an expense of $74 million in other operating and administrative expenses, which was previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
Other Employee Benefits Deferred Compensation Plans We maintain unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plans for certain members of management and nonemployee directors (each, a participant). The amount of compensation deferred by each participant is based on participant elections. Participant accounts, except for those in the NBCUniversal plan, are credited with income primarily based on a fixed annual rate. Participants in the NBCUniversal plan designate one or more valuation funds, independently established funds or indices that are used to determine the amount of earnings to be credited or debited to the participants account. Participants are eligible to receive distributions of the amounts credited to their account based on elected deferral periods that are consistent with the plans and applicable tax law.
The table below presents the benefit obligation and interest expense for our deferred compensation plans.
Year ended December31 (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Benefit obligation $ 1,434 $ 1,247 $ 1,059 Interest expense $ 128 $ 107 $ 99 We have purchased life insurance policies to recover a portion of the future payments related to our deferred compensation plans. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, the cash surrender value of these policies, which is recorded to other noncurrent assets, was $565 million and $478 million, respectively.
Retirement Investment Plans We sponsor several 401(k) defined contribution retirement plans that allow eligible employees to contribute a portion of their compensation through payroll deductions in accordance with specified plan guidelines. We make contributions to the plans that include matching a percentage of the employees contributions up to certain limits. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, expenses related to these plans totaled $324 million, $246 million and $226 million, respectively.
Split-Dollar Life Insurance Agreements We have collateral assignment split-dollar life insurance agreements with select key current and former employees that require us to incur certain insurance-related costs. Under some of these agreements, our obligation to provide benefits to the employees extends beyond retirement.

Year ended December31 (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Benefit obligation $ 212 $ 202 $ 169 Other operating and administrative expenses $ 50 $ 58 $ 27 Multiemployer Benefit Plans We also participate in various multiemployer pension and other postretirement benefit plans through the activities of NBCUniversal that cover some of our employees and temporary employees who are represented by labor unions. We make periodic contributions to these plans in accordance with the terms of applicable collective bargaining agreements and laws but do not sponsor or administer these plans. We do not participate in any multiemployer benefit plans for which we consider our contributions to be individually significant, and the largest plans in which we participate are funded at a level of 80% or greater. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, the total contributions we made to multiemployer pension and other postretirement benefit plans were $66 million, $53 million and $42 million, respectively.
If we cease to be obligated to make contributions or otherwise withdraw from participation in any of these plans, applicable law requires us to fund our allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits, which is known as a withdrawal liability.In addition, actions taken by other participating employers may lead to adverse changes in the financial condition of one of these plans, which could result in an increase in our withdrawal liability.
Severance Benefits We provide severance benefits to certain former employees. A liability is recorded for benefits provided when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recorded $160 million, $155 million and $128 million, respectively, of severance costs.

Net settled stock options, as opposed to stock options exercised with a cash payment, result in fewer shares being issued and no cash proceeds being received by us when the options are exercised.
Our share-based compensation primarily consists of awards of stock options and RSUs to certain employees and directors as part of our approach to long-term incentive compensation. Awards generally vest over a period of 5 years and in the case of stock options, have a 10 year term. Additionally, through our employee stock purchase plans, employees are able to purchase shares of Comcast ClassA common stock at a discount through payroll deductions.
Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 108 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation The cost associated with our share-based compensation is based on an awards estimated fair value at the date of grant and is recognized over the period in which any related services are provided. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. RSUs are valued based on the closing price of our ClassA common stock on the date of grant and are discounted for the lack of dividends, if any, during the vesting period. The table below presents the weighted-average fair value on the date of grant of RSUs and ClassA common stock options awarded under our various plans and the related weighted-average valuation assumptions.

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities when there are temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and for the expected benefits of using net operating loss carryforwards. When a change in the tax rate or tax law has an impact on deferred taxes, we apply the change based on the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We record the change in our consolidated financial statements in the period of enactment.
Income tax consequences that arise in connection with a business combination include identifying the tax basis of assets and liabilities acquired and any contingencies associated with uncertain tax positions assumed or resulting from the business combination. Deferred tax assets and liabilities related to temporary differences of an acquired entity are recorded as of the date of the business combination and are based on our estimate of the ultimate tax basis that will be accepted by the various taxing authorities. We record liabilities for contingencies associated with prior tax returns filed by the acquired entity based on criteria set forth in the appropriate accounting guidance. We adjust the deferred tax accounts and the liabilities periodically to reflect any revised estimated tax basis and any estimated settlements with the various taxing authorities. The effects of these adjustments are recorded to income tax expense.
From time to time, we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty. In these cases, we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and the measurement attribute in accordance with the accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions. Examples of these transactions include business acquisitions and dispositions, including consideration paid or received in connection with these transactions, and certain financing transactions. Significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statements.We classify interest and penalties, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
NBCUniversal For U.S. federal income tax purposes, NBCUniversal Holdings is treated as a partnership and NBCUniversal is disregarded as an entity separate from NBCUniversal Holdings. Accordingly, neither NBCUniversal Holdings nor NBCUniversal and its subsidiaries incur any material current or deferred domestic income taxes. Following the close of the Redemption Transaction in March 2013, the taxable income of NBCUniversal Holdings and NBCUniversal is allocable entirely to us.
We are indemnified by GE for any income tax liability attributable to the NBCUniversal contributed businesses for periods prior to the date of the 2011 NBCUniversal Transaction and also for any income tax liability attributable to NBCUniversal Enterprise for periods prior to the date of the Redemption Transaction. We have indemnified GE for any income tax liability attributable to the Comcast Content Business for periods prior to the date of the 2011 NBCUniversal Transaction.
Current and deferred foreign income taxes are incurred by NBCUniversals foreign subsidiaries. In 2013, 2012, and 2011, NBCUniversal had foreign income before taxes of $524 million, $434 million and $476 million, respectively, on which foreign income tax expense was recorded. We recorded U.S. income tax expense on our allocable share of NBCUniversals income before domestic and foreign taxes, which was reduced by a U.S. tax credit equal to our allocable share of NBCUniversals foreign income tax expense.

Our net deferred tax liability includes $23 billion related to cable franchise rights that will remain unchanged unless we recognize an impairment or dispose of a cable franchise.
Net deferred tax assets included in current assets are primarily related to our current investments and current liabilities. As of December31, 2013, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $176 million and various state net operating loss carryforwards that expire in periods through 2033. As of December31, 2013, we also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $279 million that are related to the foreign operations of NBCUniversal, the majority of which expire in periods through 2023. The determination of the realization of the state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on our subsidiaries taxable income or loss, apportionment percentages, and state and foreign laws that can change from year to year and impact the amount of such carryforwards. We recognize a valuation allowance if we determine it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, our valuation allowance was related primarily to state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, income tax expense attributable to share-based compensation of $244 million, $164 million and $38 million, respectively, was allocated to shareholders equity.
Uncertain Tax Positions Our uncertain tax positions as of December31, 2013 totaled $1.7 billion, which excludes the federal benefits on state tax positions that were recorded as deferred income taxes. Included in our uncertain tax positions was $283 million related to tax positions of NBCUniversal and NBCUniversal Enterprise for which we have been indemnified by GE. If we were to recognize the tax benefit for our uncertain tax positions in the future, $980 million would impact our effective tax rate and the remaining amount would increase our deferred income tax liability. The amount and timing of the recognition of any such tax benefit is dependent on the completion of our tax examinations and the expiration of statutes of limitations. A majority of the amount of our uncertain tax positions relates to positions taken in years before 2007.

As of December31, 2013 and 2012, $42 million and $11 million, respectively, of these amounts were related to tax positions of NBCUniversal and NBCUniversal Enterprise for which we have been indemnified by GE.
During 2013, the IRS completed its examination of our income tax returns for the years 2009 through 2011. During 2013, we effectively settled federal tax disputes related to prior periods. These settlements did not have a material impact on our income tax expense.
Various states are examining our tax returns through 2011. The tax years of our state tax returns currently under examination vary by state. The majority of the periods under examination relate to tax years 2000 and forward, with a select few dating back to 1993.
It is reasonably possible that certain statutes of limitations for the years 2000 through 2006 will expire within the next 12 months that could result in a decrease to our uncertain tax positions.

In connection with these terminations, NBCUniversal remitted final payments to the third-party banks that totaled $1.442 billion (the termination payments) in order to acquire $1.078 billion of accounts receivables that had been monetized and remained uncollected as of the date of the terminations and settle $364 million of cash receipts that we had collected and had not yet remitted to the banks. The termination payments are included within net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.
Prior to the terminations, we accounted for receivables monetized through these programs as sales in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance. We received deferred consideration from the assets sold in the form of a receivable, which was funded by residual cash flows after the senior interests had been fully paid. As of December31, 2012, the deferred consideration was included in receivables, net at its initial fair value, which reflects the net cash flows we expected to receive related to those interests.
Receivables Monetized and Deferred Consideration December31 (in millions) 2012 Monetized receivables sold $ 791 Deferred consideration $ 274 In addition to the amounts presented above, we had $882 million payable to our monetization programs as of December31, 2012. These amounts represented cash receipts that were not yet remitted to the monetization programs and were recorded to accounts payable and accrued expenses related to trade creditors.
The net cash payments on transfers that are included within net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows were $86 million and $237 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The receivables monetization programs did not have a material effect on our consolidated statement of income for the periods presented.
Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies Commitments NBCUniversal enters into long-term commitments with third parties in the ordinary course of its business, including commitments to acquire film and television programming, creative talent and employment agreements, and various other television-related commitments. Many of NBCUniversals employees, including writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel, and others, as well as some of its on-air and creative talent, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. As of December31, 2013, the total number of NBCUniversal full-time, part-time and hourly employees on its payroll covered by collective bargaining agreements was 7,200 full-time equivalent employees. Of this total, approximately 19% of these full-time equivalent employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements that have expired or are scheduled to expire during 2014.
We, through Comcast-Spectacor, have employment agreements with both players and coaches of the Philadelphia Flyers. Certain of these employment agreements, which provide for payments that are guaranteed regardless of employee injury or termination, are covered by disability insurance if certain conditions are met.

The potential class in the Massachusetts case, which has been transferred to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, is our customer base in the Boston Cluster area, and the potential class in the Pennsylvania case is our customer base in the Philadelphia and Chicago Clusters, as those terms are defined in the complaints. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that certain customer exchange transactions with other cable providers resulted in unlawful horizontal market restraints in those areas and seek damages under antitrust statutes, including treble damages.
Classes of Chicago Cluster and Philadelphia Cluster customers were certified in October 2007 and January 2010, respectively. We appealed the class certification in the Philadelphia Cluster case to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed the class certification in August 2011. In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court granted our petition to review the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruling and in March 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that the class had been improperly certified and reversed the judgment of the Third Circuit. The matter has been returned to the District Court for action consistent with the Supreme Courts opinion. In August 2013, a plaintiff in the Philadelphia Cluster case moved to certify a new, smaller class. The District Court denied our September 2013 motion to strike the plaintiffs motion on procedural grounds, and a decision on the plaintiffs motion is expected in 2014. The plaintiffs claims concerning the other two clusters are stayed pending determination of the Philadelphia Cluster claims.
In addition, we are the defendant in 22 purported class actions filed in federal district courts throughout the country. All of these actions have been consolidated by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for pre-trial proceedings. In a consolidated complaint filed in November 2009 on behalf of all plaintiffs in the multidistrict litigation, the plaintiffs allege that we improperly tie the rental of set-top boxes to the provision of premium cable services in violation of Section1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, various state antitrust laws and unfair/deceptive trade 115 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents Comcast Corporation practices acts in California, Illinois and Alabama. The plaintiffs also allege a claim for unjust enrichment and seek relief on behalf of a nationwide class of our premium cable customers and on behalf of subclasses consisting of premium cable customers from California, Alabama, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Washington. In January 2010, we moved to compel arbitration of the plaintiffs claims for unjust enrichment and violations of the unfair/deceptive trade practices acts of Illinois and Alabama. In September 2010, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint alleging violations of additional state antitrust laws and unfair/deceptive trade practices acts on behalf of new subclasses in Connecticut, Florida, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico and West Virginia. In the amended complaint, plaintiffs omitted their unjust enrichment claim, as well as their state law claims on behalf of the Alabama, Illinois and Pennsylvania subclasses. In June 2011, the plaintiffs filed another amended complaint alleging only violations of Section1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, antitrust law in Washington and unfair/deceptive trade practices acts in California and Washington. The plaintiffs seek relief on behalf of a nationwide class of our premium cable customers and on behalf of subclasses consisting of premium cable customers from California and Washington. In July 2011, we moved to compel arbitration of most of the plaintiffs claims and to stay the remaining claims pending arbitration. The West Virginia Attorney General also filed a complaint in West Virginia state court in July 2009 alleging that we improperly tie the rental of set-top boxes to the provision of digital cable services in violation of the West Virginia Antitrust Act and the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act. The Attorney General also alleges a claim for unjust enrichment/restitution. We removed the case to the United States District Court for West Virginia, and it was subsequently transferred to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and consolidated with the multidistrict litigation described above. In June 2013, a comprehensive settlement agreement for all 23 cases was submitted to the District Court for preliminary approval. Regardless of whether this settlement agreement is approved, we do not expect these cases to have a material effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
We believe the claims in each of the pending actions described above in this item are without merit, except as otherwise set forth above, and intend to defend the actions vigorously. We cannot predict the outcome of any of the actions described above, including a range of possible loss, or how the final resolution of any such actions would impact our results of operations or cash flows for any one period or our financial position. In addition, as any action nears a trial, there is an increased possibility that the action may be settled by the parties. Nevertheless, the final disposition of any of the above actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for any one period.
Other We are a defendant in several unrelated lawsuits claiming infringement of various patents relating to various aspects of our businesses. In certain of these cases other industry participants are also defendants, and also in certain of these cases we expect that any potential liability would be in part or in whole the responsibility of our equipment and technology vendors under applicable contractual indemnification provisions. We are also subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. While the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions is not expected to materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial position, any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings or claims could be time consuming, costly and injure our reputation.

Beginning in 2013, revenue from certain business customers, such as hotels, restaurants and bars, is presented in business services revenue rather than in video revenue. Reclassifications have been made to the prior year periods to conform to this presentation.
For each of 2013, 2012 and 2011, 2.8% of Cable Communications revenue was derived from franchise and other regulatory fees.
(b) For 2012, our Broadcast Television segment included all revenue and costs and expenses associated with our broadcast of the 2012 London Olympics, which generated $120 million of operating income before depreciation and amortization. This amount reflects the settlement of a $237 million liability associated with the unfavorable Olympics contract that had been recorded through the application of acquisition accounting in 2011.
(c) For the period January29, 2011 through June30, 2011, we recorded Universal Orlando as an equity method investment in our consolidated results of operations. However, our Theme Parks segment included the results of operations for Universal Orlando for the period January29, 2011 through June30, 2011 to reflect our measure of operating performance for our Theme Parks segment.
(d) NBCUniversal Headquarters and Other activities includes costs associated with overhead, allocations, personnel costs and headquarter initiatives.
(e) Included in Eliminations are transactions that our segments enter into with one another. The most common types of transactions are the following:  our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments generate revenue by selling programming to our Cable Communications segment, which represents a substantial majority of the revenue elimination amount  our Cable Communications segment generates revenue by selling advertising and by selling the use of satellite feeds to our Cable Networks segment  our Filmed Entertainment and Broadcast Television segments generate revenue by licensing content to our Cable Networks segment  our Cable Communications segment receives incentives offered by our Cable Networks segment in connection with its distribution of the Cable Networks content that are recorded as a reduction to programming expenses Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 118 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation NBCUniversal eliminations for 2011 included the eliminations of the results of operations for Universal Orlando for the period January29, 2011 through June30, 2011. These amounts were not included in NBCUniversals total and our consolidated results of operations for the period January29, 2011 through June30, 2011 because we recorded Universal Orlando as an equity method investment during this period.
(f) Revenue from customers located outside of the U.S., primarily in Europe and Asia, for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $4.8 billion, $4.5 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. No single customer accounted for a significant amount of our revenue in any period.
(g) We use operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of assets, if any, as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. Additionally, it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. We use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, net cash provided by operating activities, or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with GAAP.

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company and the Predecessor Company are not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of their internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purposes of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys or the Predecessor Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December31, 2013 and 2012, the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012, and for the period from January29, 2011 to December31, 2011 (successor), and the results of the Predecessor Companys operations and cash flows for the period from January1, 2011 to January28, 2011 (predecessor), in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

151 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents NBCUniversal Media, LLC Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1: Business and Basis of Presentation We are one of the worlds leading media and entertainment companies that develops, produces and distributes entertainment, news and information, sports, and other content for global audiences. In 2011, Comcast closed its transaction with General Electric Company (GE), in which Comcast acquired control of the businesses of NBCUniversal Media, LLC (NBCUniversal), and in 2013, Comcast acquired GEs remaining 49% common equity interest in our parent NBCUniversal, LLC (NBCUniversal Holdings). See Note 3 for additional information on these transactions.
We present our operations as the following four reportable business segments: Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks. See Note 18 for additional information on our reportable business segments.
Our Cable Networks segment consists primarily of a diversified portfolio of cable television networks. Our cable networks are comprised of our national cable networks, which provide a variety of entertainment, news and information, and sports content, our regional sports and news networks, our international cable networks, and our cable television production operations.
Our Broadcast Television segment consists primarily of the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks, our NBC and Telemundo owned local television stations, and our broadcast television production operations.
Our Filmed Entertainment segment primarily produces, acquires, markets and distributes filmed entertainment worldwide. Our films are produced primarily under the Universal Pictures, Focus Features and Illumination names.
Our Theme Parks segment consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando and Hollywood. We also receive fees from third parties that own and operate Universal Studios Japan and Universal Studios Singapore for intellectual property licenses and other services.
Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all entities in which we have a controlling voting interest (subsidiaries) and variable interest entities (VIEs) required to be consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Transactions between NBCUniversal and Comcast, and their consolidated subsidiaries are reflected in these consolidated financial statements and disclosed as related party transactions when material.
We translate assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is the local currency, primarily the euro and the British pound, into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect as of the balance sheet date. The related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We translate revenue and expenses using average monthly exchange rates, and the related foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in our consolidated statement of income.
As a result of the change in control of our company on January28, 2011, Comcast applied the acquisition method of accounting with respect to the assets and liabilities of the NBCUniversal businesses it acquired (NBCUniversal contributed business), which were remeasured to fair value as of the date of the Joint Venture transaction. Our consolidated financial statements for periods following the close of the Joint Venture transaction are labeled Successor and reflect both Comcasts basis of accounting in the new fair values of the assets and liabilities of the NBCUniversal contributed businesses and the consolidation of the Comcast Content Business at historical cost. All periods prior to the close of the Joint Venture transaction reflect the historical accounting basis in our assets and liabilities and are labeled Predecessor. Our consolidated finan- Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K 152 Table of Contents NBCUniversal Media, LLC cial statements and footnotes include a black line division, which appears between the columns titled Predecessor and Successor, which signifies that the amounts shown for the periods prior to and following the Joint Venture transaction are not comparable. See Note 3 for additional information on the Joint Venture transaction.
Reclassifications Reclassifications have been made to our consolidated financial statements for the prior years to conform to classifications used in 2013.
Note 2: Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to select accounting policies, including in certain cases industry-specific policies, and make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We believe the judgments and related estimates for the following items are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:  revenue recognition (see below)  film and television costs (see Note 5)  goodwill and intangible assets (see Note 8)  fair value of contractual obligations (see Note 10) In addition, the following accounting policies are specific to the industries in which we operate:  capitalization and amortization of film and television costs (see Note 5) Information on our other accounting policies or methods related to our consolidated financial statements are included, where applicable, in their respective footnotes that follow. Below is a discussion of accounting policies and methods used in our consolidated financial statements that are not presented within other footnotes.
Revenue Recognition Cable Networks and Broadcast Television Segments Our Cable Networks segment generates revenue primarily from the distribution of our cable network programming to multichannel video providers, the sale of advertising and the licensing of our owned programming. Our Broadcast Television segment generates revenue primarily from the sale of advertising, the licensing of our owned programming and the fees received under retransmission consent agreements. We recognize revenue from distributors as programming is provided, generally under multiyear distribution agreements. From time to time, the distribution agreements expire while programming continues to be provided to the distributor based on interim arrangements while the parties negotiate new contract terms. Revenue recognition is generally limited to current payments being made by the distributor, typically under the prior contract terms, until a new contract is negotiated, sometimes with effective dates that affect prior periods. Differences between actual amounts determined upon resolution of negotiations and amounts recorded during these interim arrangements are recorded in the period of resolution.
Advertising revenue for our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments is recognized in the period in which commercials are aired or viewed. In some instances, we guarantee viewer ratings for the commercials. To the extent there is a shortfall in the ratings that were guaranteed, a portion of the revenue is deferred until 153 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents NBCUniversal Media, LLC the shortfall is settled, primarily by providing additional advertising time. We record revenue from the licensing of our owned programming when the content is available for use by the licensee, and when certain other conditions are met. When license fees include advertising time, we recognize the advertising time component of revenue when the advertisements are aired or viewed.
Filmed Entertainment Segment Our Filmed Entertainment segment generates revenue primarily from the worldwide distribution of our owned and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters, the licensing of our owned and acquired films to cable, broadcast and premium networks and digital distributors, and the sale of our owned and acquired films on both standard-definition DVDs and Blu-ray discs (together, DVDs) and through digital distributors. We also generate revenue from producing and licensing live stage plays and distributing filmed entertainment produced by third parties. We recognize revenue from the distribution of films to movie theaters when the films are exhibited. We record revenue from the licensing of a film when the film is available for use by the licensee, and when certain other conditions are met. We recognize revenue from DVD sales, net of estimated returns and customer incentives, on the date that DVDs are delivered to and made available for sale by retailers.
Theme Parks Segment Our Theme Parks segment generates revenue primarily from theme park attendance and per capita spending at our Universal theme parks in Orlando and Hollywood, as well as from licensing and other fees. We recognize revenue from advance theme park ticket sales when the tickets are used. For annual passes, we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the annual period following the initial redemption date.
Advertising Expenses Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Cash Equivalents The carrying amounts of our cash equivalents approximate their fair value. Our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds and U.S. government obligations, as well as commercial paper and certificates of deposit with maturities of less than three months when purchased.
Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Our objective is to manage the financial and operational exposure arising from these risks by offsetting gains and losses on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivatives used to economically hedge them.
Our derivative financial instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The impact of our derivative financial instruments on our consolidated financial statements was not material for all periods presented.
Note 3: Significant Transactions 2013 Redemption Transaction On March19, 2013, Comcast acquired GEs remaining 49% common equity interest in NBCUniversal for approximately $16.7 billion (the Redemption Transaction). In addition to this transaction, we purchased from GE certain properties we occupy at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City and CNBCs headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey for $1.4 billion.
Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 154 Table of Contents NBCUniversal Media, LLC The total consideration for these transactions consisted of $11.4 billion of cash on hand (of which we funded $4.6 billion); $4 billion of senior debt securities issued by NBCUniversal Enterprise, Inc. (NBCUniversal Enterprise), a holding company whose principal assets are its interests in NBCUniversal Holdings; $750 million of cash funded through Comcasts commercial paper program; $1.25 billion of borrowings under NBCUniversal Enterprises credit facility, which replaced our credit facility; and $725 million aggregate liquidation preference of Series A cumulative preferred stock of NBCUniversal Enterprise. After the close of the transaction, GE sold the interests in NBCUniversal Enterprises senior debt securities and preferred stock it acquired in the Redemption Transaction to unaffiliated third parties.
Following the close of the Redemption Transaction, Comcast owns 96% of NBCUniversal Holdings common units and NBCUniversal Enterprise owns the remaining 4%. NBCUniversal Enterprise is now a consolidated subsidiary of Comcast, but we do not have any ownership interests in NBCUniversal Enterprise. NBCUniversal Enterprise also owns all of NBCUniversal Holdings preferred units with a $9.4 billion aggregate liquidation preference. NBCUniversal Holdings is required to make quarterly payments to NBCUniversal Enterprise at an initial rate of 8.25%per annum on the $9.4 billion aggregate liquidation preference of the preferred units. On March1, 2018, and thereafter on every fifth anniversary of such date, this rate will reset to 7.44% plus the yield on actively traded United States Treasury securities having a 5 year maturity. NBCUniversal Holdings has the right to redeem all of the preferred units during the 30 day period beginning on March1, 2018, and NBCUniversal Enterprise has the right to cause NBCUniversal Holdings to redeem 15% of its preferred units during the 30 day period beginning on March19, 2020. The price and units in a redemption initiated by either party will be based on the liquidation preference plus accrued but unpaid dividends and adjusted, in the case of an exercise of NBCUniversal Enterprises right, to the extent the equity value of NBCUniversal Holdings is less than the liquidation preference. Our cash flows are, and will continue to be, the primary source of funding for the required payments and any future redemption of the NBCUniversal Holdings preferred units.
2011 Joint Venture Transaction On January28, 2011, Comcast and GE closed the Joint Venture transaction, which among other things, converted our company into a limited liability company that became a wholly owned subsidiary of NBCUniversal Holdings. NBCUniversal comprises the NBCUniversal contributed businesses and the Comcast Content Business. In addition to contributing the Comcast Content Business to NBCUniversal, Comcast made a cash payment to GE of $6.2 billion, which included transaction-related costs. Comcast also agreed to share with GE certain tax benefits as they are realized that relate to the form and structure of the Joint Venture transaction. These payments to GE are contingent on Comcast realizing tax benefits in the future and are accounted for as contingent consideration by Comcast.
Universal Orlando Transaction On July1, 2011, we acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in Universal Orlando that we did not already own for $1 billion. Following the close of the transaction, Universal Orlando is a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, and its operations are reported in our Theme Parks segment. We recorded $982 million of goodwill in our allocation of purchase price for this transaction, which was fully allocated to our Theme Parks segment.
155 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents NBCUniversal Media, LLC Note 4: Related Party Transactions In the ordinary course of our business, we enter into transactions with Comcast.
We generate revenue from Comcast primarily from the distribution of our cable network programming and, to a lesser extent, the sale of advertising and our owned programming, and we incur expenses primarily related to various support services provided by Comcast to us.
On March19, 2013, as part of the Comcast cash management process, we and Comcast entered into a revolving credit agreement under which we can borrow up to $3 billion from Comcast and Comcast can borrow up to $3 billion from us. Amounts owed by us to Comcast under the revolving credit agreement, including accrued interest, are presented under the caption note payable to Comcast in our consolidated balance sheet. The revolving credit agreements bear interest at floating rates equal to the interest rate under the Comcast and Comcast Cable Communications, LLC revolving credit facility (the Comcast revolving credit facility). The interest rate on the Comcast revolving credit facility consists of a base rate plus a borrowing margin that is determined based on Comcasts credit rating. As of December31, 2013, the borrowing margin for London Interbank Offered Rate based borrowings was 1.00%.
In addition, Comcast is the counterparty to one of our contractual obligations. As of December31, 2013, the carrying value of the liability associated with this contractual obligation was $383 million. See Note 10 for additional information on this contractual obligation.
The following tables present transactions with Comcast and its consolidated subsidiaries that are included in our consolidated financial statements.
Consolidated Balance Sheet Successor December31 (in millions) 2013 2012 Transactions with Comcast and consolidated subsidiaries Receivables, net $ 228 $ 204 Accounts payable and accrued expenses related to trade creditors $ 56 $ 25 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 37 $ 1 Note payable to Comcast $ 799 $  Other noncurrent liabilities $ 383 $  Consolidated Statement of Income Successor (in millions) Year Ended December31, 2013 Year Ended December31, 2012 For the Period January29,2011to December31,2011 Transactions with Comcast and consolidated subsidiaries Revenue $ 1,262 $ 1,228 $ 1,025 Operating costs and expenses $ (190 ) $ (175 ) $ (72 ) Distributions to NBCUniversal Holdings In addition to the transactions above, we make distributions to NBCUniversal Holdings on a periodic basis to enable its owners to meet their obligations to pay taxes on taxable income generated by our businesses. We also make quarterly distributions to NBCUniversal Holdings to enable it to make its required quarterly pay- Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 156 Table of Contents NBCUniversal Media, LLC ments to NBCUniversal Enterprise at an initial annual rate of 8.25% on the $9.4 billion aggregate liquidation preference of its preferred units. These distributions are presented under the caption distributions to member in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Following the close of the Redemption Transaction, none of these distributions to NBCUniversal Holdings are attributable to GE.
In connection with the Redemption Transaction, we also made a distribution of $3.2 billion to NBCUniversal Holdings to fund a portion of the Redemption Transaction. This distribution is presented separately in our consolidated statement of cash flows.
Transactions with GE Following the close of the Redemption Transaction and the subsequent sale of NBCUniversal Enterprises preferred stock and senior notes by GE to unaffiliated third parties in March 2013, we no longer consider GE to be a related party.
In February 2013, Comcast closed an agreement with GE, General Electric Capital Corporation (GECC) and LIN TV under which, among other things, we purchased a note held by Station Venture Holdings, LLC (Station Venture) from GECC for $602 million, which effectively settled a liability of $482 million that had been recorded in the allocation of purchase price associated with the Joint Venture transaction.Due to the related party nature of this transaction, the excess of the purchase price of the Station Venture note over the recorded amount of the liability was recorded to members capital. Other than the Station Venture transaction, dividend payments to GE that are included under the caption dividends on our consolidated statement of changes in equity and our consolidated statement of cash flows, and the transactions discussed in Note 3, the amounts related to our transactions with GE and its consolidated subsidiaries that occurred prior to the close of the Redemption Transaction were not material.

Approximately 85% of 157 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents NBCUniversal Media, LLC unamortized film and television costs for our released productions, excluding amounts allocated to acquired libraries, are expected to be amortized through 2016.
As of December31, 2013, acquired film and television libraries, which are included within the released, less amortization captions in the table above, had remaining unamortized costs of $711 million. These costs are generally amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years, and approximately 49% of these costs are expected to be amortized through 2016.
Capitalization of Film and Television Costs We capitalize film and television production costs, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest. We amortize capitalized film and television production costs, including acquired libraries, and accrue costs associated with participation and residual payments to programming and production expense. We generally record the amortization and the accrued costs using the individual film forecast computation method, which amortizes such costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of total revenue and total costs are based on anticipated release patterns, public acceptance and historical results for similar productions. Unamortized film and television costs, including acquired film and television libraries, are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. We do not capitalize costs related to the distribution of a film to movie theaters or the licensing or sale of a film or television production, which are primarily costs associated with the marketing and distribution of film and television programming.
In determining the estimated lives and method of amortization of acquired film and television libraries, we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset.
Upon the occurrence of an event or a change in circumstance that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of a film is less than its unamortized costs, we determine the fair value of the film and record an impairment charge for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the films fair value.
We enter into arrangements with third parties to jointly finance and distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements, which are referred to as cofinancing arrangements, can take various forms. In most cases, the arrangement involves the grant of an economic interest in a film to a third-party investor. The number of investors and the terms of these arrangements can vary, although in most cases an investor assumes full risk for the portion of the film acquired in these arrangements. We account for the proceeds received from a third-party investor under these arrangements as a reduction to our capitalized film costs. In these arrangements, the investor owns an undivided copyright interest in the film and, therefore, in each period we record either a charge or a benefit to programming and production expense to reflect the estimate of the third-party investors interest in the profit or loss of the film. The estimate of the third-party investors interest in the profit or loss of a film is determined using the ratio of actual revenue earned to date to the ultimate revenue expected to be recognized over the films useful life.
We capitalize the costs of programming content that we license but do not own, including rights to multiyear live-event sports programming, at the earlier of when payments are made for the programming or when the license period begins and the content is available for use. We amortize capitalized programming costs as the associated programs are broadcast. We amortize multiyear, live-event sports programming rights using the ratio of the current periods revenue to the estimated total remaining revenue or under the terms of the contract.
Acquired programming costs are recorded at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value on a program by program, package, channel or daypart basis. A daypart is an aggregation of programs broadcast Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 158 Table of Contents NBCUniversal Media, LLC during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. Acquired programming used in our Cable Networks segment is primarily tested on a channel basis for impairment, whereas acquired programming used in our Broadcast Television segment is tested on a daypart basis. If we determine that the estimates of future cash flows are insufficient or if there is no plan to broadcast certain programming, we recognize an impairment charge to programming and production expense.

Equity method investments are recorded at cost and are adjusted to recognize (i)our proportionate share of the investees net income or losses after the date of investment, (ii)amortization of the recorded investment that exceeds our share of the book value of the investees net assets, (iii)additional contributions made and dividends received, and (iv)impairments resulting from other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Gains or losses on the sale of equity method investee are recorded to other income (expense), net. If an equity method investment were to issue additional securities that would change our proportionate share of the entity, we would recognize the change, if any, as a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of income.
The Weather Channel In June 2013, we received a distribution from The Weather Channel Holding Corp. (The Weather Channel) of $152 million, of which $128 million was recorded as a return of our investment in The Weather Channel and included under the caption return of capital from investees in our consolidated statement of cash flows.
Hulu In July 2013, we entered into an agreement to provide capital contributions totaling $247 million to Hulu, LLC (Hulu), which we had previously accounted for as a cost method investment. This represented an agreement to provide our first capital contribution to Hulu since Comcast acquired its interest in Hulu as part of the Joint Venture transaction, therefore we began to apply the equity method of accounting for this investment. The change in the method of accounting for this investment required us to recognize our proportionate share of Hulus accumulated losses from the date of the Joint Venture transaction through July 2013. Prior period financial statements have not been restated as the amounts are not material for the periods presented.
Impairment Testing of Investments We review our investment portfolio each reporting period to determine whether there are identified events or circumstances that would indicate there is a decline in the fair value that would be considered other than temporary. For our nonpublic investments, if there are no identified events or circumstances that would have 159 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents NBCUniversal Media, LLC a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment, then the fair value is not estimated. If an investment is deemed to have experienced an other-than-temporary decline below its cost basis, we reduce the carrying amount of the investment to its quoted or estimated fair value, as applicable, and establish a new cost basis for the investment. For our AFS and cost method investments, we record the impairment to investment income (loss), net. For our equity method investments, we record the impairment to other income (expense), net. During 2013, we recorded $249 million of impairment charges to our equity method investments, which were primarily related to a regional sports cable network based in Houston, Texas.

For assets that are sold or retired, we remove the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation and, unless the gain or loss on disposition is presented separately, we recognize it as a component of depreciation expense.
We evaluate the recoverability of our property and equipment whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is based on the cash flows generated by the underlying asset groups, including estimated future operating results, trends or other determinants of fair value. If the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset group, we would recognize an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount of the asset group exceeded its estimated fair value. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of depreciation expense.
Acquisitions of Real Estate Properties Real estate acquisitions for 2013 primarily included our purchase from GE of certain properties we occupy at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City and CNBCs headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. The CNBC property was previously recorded as a capital lease in our consolidated balance sheet. Other acquisitions included our purchase in September 2013 of a business whose primary asset is a property located at 10 Universal City Plaza, which is adjacent to Universal Studios in Hollywood, California. These purchases resulted in increases of $1.7 billion in property and equipment which are included, as applicable, within the captions buildings and leasehold improvements and land in the table above.

Adjustments to goodwill in 2012 were primarily related to the adjustments to the allocation of purchase price associated with the Universal Orlando transaction in 2011.
We assess the recoverability of our goodwill annually, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. To determine our reporting units, we evaluate the components one level below the segment level and we aggregate the components if they have similar economic characteristics. As a result of this assessment, our reporting units are the same as our four reportable segments. We evaluate the determination of our reporting units used to test for impairment periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. The quantitative assessment considers if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, in which case an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of amortization expense.

We assess the recoverability of our indefinite-lived intangible assets annually, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. We evaluate the unit of account used to test for impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur to ensure impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. When performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment. When analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions, and profitability information. If the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets were less than the carrying amount, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of amortization expense.

We capitalize direct development costs associated with internal-use software, including external direct costs of material and services and payroll costs for employees devoting time to these software projects. We also capitalize costs associated with the purchase of software licenses. We include these costs in intangible assets and amortize them on a straight-line basis over a period not to exceed five years. We expense maintenance and training costs, as well as costs incurred during the preliminary stage of a project, as they are incurred. We capitalize initial operating system software costs and amortize them over the life of the associated hardware.
We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is based on the cash flows generated by the underlying asset groups, including estimated future operating results, trends or other determinants of fair value.

The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt is based on quoted market values for the debt. To estimate the fair value of debt for which there are no quoted market prices, we use interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.

As a result, we no longer have a revolving credit facility with third-party banks. Following the amendments to our credit agreement, our commercial paper program was terminated and we entered into a revolving credit agreement with Comcast. See Note 4 for additional information on the revolving credit agreement with Comcast.
Cross-Guarantee Structure On March27, 2013, we, Comcast and four of Comcasts wholly owned cable holding company subsidiaries (the cable guarantors) entered into a series of agreements and supplemental indentures to include us as a part of Comcasts existing cross-guarantee structure.As members of the cross-guarantee structure, Comcast and the cable guarantors fully and unconditionally guarantee our public debt securities, and we fully and unconditionally guarantee all of Comcasts and the cable guarantors public debt securities. As of December31, 2013, we guaranteed $31 billion of outstanding debt securities of Comcast and the cable guarantors. We also fully and unconditionally guarantee the $6.25 billion Comcast revolving credit facility due 2017, of which no amounts were outstanding as of December31, 2013.

Note 10: Fair Value Measurements The accounting guidance related to financial assets and financial liabilities (financial instruments) establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach). Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of financial instruments and their classification within the fair value hierarchy.
Our financial instruments that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis were not material for all periods presented, except for liabilities associated with our contractual obligations. The fair values of the contractual obligations in the table below are primarily based on certain expected future discounted cash flows, the determination of which involves the use of significant unobservable inputs. As the inputs used are not quoted market prices or observable inputs, we classify these contractual obligations as Level 3 financial instruments.
The most significant unobservable inputs we use are our estimates of the future revenue we expect to generate from certain of our entities. The discount rates used in the measurements of fair value as of December31, 2013 were between 12% and 13% and are based on the underlying risk associated with our estimate of future revenue, as well as the terms of the respective contracts. The fair value adjustments to contractual obligations are sensitive to the assumptions related to future revenue, as well as to current interest rates, and therefore, the adjustments are recorded to other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income.
In October 2013, Comcast closed its transaction with Liberty Media Corporation (Liberty Media), which included, among other things, the delivery of Liberty Media shares held by Comcast in exchange for Liberty Medias interests in one of our contractual obligations. The liability associated with this contractual obligation is now considered a related party transaction and as a result we no longer remeasure this liability to its fair value on a recurring basis.

In the case of film or stage play production costs, upon the occurrence of an event or change in circumstance that may indicate that the fair value of a production is less than its unamortized costs, we determine the fair value of the production and record an adjustment for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the productions fair value.The estimate of fair value of a production is determined using Level 3 inputs, primarily an analysis of future expected cash flows.Adjustments to capitalized film and stage play production costs of $167 million and $161 million were recorded in 2013 and 2012, respectively.

(b) We did not recognize service cost in 2013 as our pension plans were frozen. The 2012 and 2011 amounts included service costs related to our pension benefits of $134 million and $99 million, respectively.
Postretirement Benefit Plans We have postretirement medical and life insurance plans that provide continuous coverage to employees eligible to receive such benefits and give credit for length of service provided before the close of the Joint Venture transaction.
Substantially all of the employees that joined NBCUniversal from the Comcast Content Business at the close of the Joint Venture transaction participate in a postretirement healthcare stipend program (the stipend plan). The stipend plan provides an annual stipend for reimbursement of healthcare costs to each eligible employee based on years of service. Under the stipend plan, we are not exposed to the increasing costs of healthcare because the benefits are fixed at a predetermined amount.
All of our postretirement benefit plans are unfunded and substantially all of our postretirement benefit obligations are recorded to noncurrent liabilities. The expense we recognize related to our postretirement benefit plans is determined using certain assumptions, including the discount rate.
Pension Plans We sponsor various domestic qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans for which future benefits were frozen effective December31, 2012. We ceased to recognize service costs associated with these defined benefit plans following the date on which future benefits were frozen. The expense we recognize related to our defined benefit plans is determined using certain assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We recognize the funded or unfunded status of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability in our consolidated balance sheet and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). In the 165 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents NBCUniversal Media, LLC event of a defined benefit plan termination, we expect to fully fund and settle the plan within 180 days of approval by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). In addition to the defined benefit plans we sponsor, we are also obligated to reimburse GE for future benefit payments to those participants who were vested in the supplemental pension plan sponsored by GE at the time of the close of the Joint Venture transaction.
In October 2013, we provided notice to the plan participants of our qualified pension plan of our intent to terminate our plan effective December31, 2013. Our qualified pension plan was unfunded by $8 million as of December31, 2013, and we will seek approval for this termination from the IRS and PBGC in 2014.
Our consolidated balance sheet also includes the assets and liabilities of certain legacy pension plans, as well as the assets and liabilities for pension plans of certain foreign subsidiaries. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, the benefit obligations associated with these plans exceeded the value of their plan assets by $43 million and $50 million, respectively.
Other Employee Benefits Deferred Compensation Plans We maintain unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plans for certain members of management and nonemployee directors (each, a participant). The amount of compensation deferred by each participant is based on participant elections. Participants in the plan designate one or more valuation funds, independently established funds or indices that are used to determine the amount of earnings to be credited or debited to the participants account.
Additionally, certain of our employees participate in Comcasts unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The amount of compensation deferred by each participant is based on participant elections. Participant accounts are credited with income primarily based on a fixed annual rate.
In the case of both deferred compensation plans, participants are eligible to receive distributions of the amounts credited to their account based on elected deferral periods that are consistent with the plans and applicable tax law.
The table below presents the benefit obligation and interest expense for our deferred compensation plans.

We make contributions to the plans that include matching a percentage of the employees contributions up to certain limits. In 2013, 2012 and for the period January29, 2011 to December31, 2011, expenses related to these plans totaled $152 million, $85 million and $70 million, respectively.
Multiemployer Benefit Plans We also participate in various multiemployer pension and other postretirement benefit plans that cover some of our employees and temporary employees who are represented by labor unions. We make periodic contributions to these plans in accordance with the terms of applicable collective bargaining agreements and Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 166 Table of Contents NBCUniversal Media, LLC laws but do not sponsor or administer these plans. We do not participate in any multiemployer benefit plans for which we consider our contributions to be individually significant, and the largest plans in which we participate are funded at a level of 80% or greater. In 2013, 2012 and for the period January29, 2011 to December31, 2011, the total contributions we made to multiemployer pension and other postretirement benefit plans were $66 million, $53 million and $42 million, respectively.
If we cease to be obligated to make contributions or otherwise withdraw from participation in any of these plans, applicable law requires us to fund our allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits, which is known as a withdrawal liability.In addition, actions taken by other participating employers may lead to adverse changes in the financial condition of one of these plans, which could result in an increase in our withdrawal liability.
Severance Benefits We provide severance benefits to certain former employees. A liability is recorded for benefits provided when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated. During 2013, 2012 and for the period January29, 2011 to December31, 2011, we recorded $116 million, $90 million and $89 million, respectively, of severance costs.
Note 12: Equity NBCUniversal Holdings has caused us and will continue to cause us to make distributions or loans to NBCUniversal Holdings to meet its cash requirements. These requirements include an obligation to make distributions on a quarterly basis to enable Comcast to meet its obligations to pay taxes on taxable income generated by our businesses and quarterly payments from NBCUniversal Holdings to NBCUniversal Enterprise on the liquidation preference of its preferred units. During 2013, 2012 and the period January29, 2011 through December31, 2011, we made distributions to NBCUniversal Holdings of $1.4 billion, $964 million and $244 million, respectively. In addition, we also made a distribution of $3.2 billion to NBCUniversal Holdings to fund a portion of the Redemption Transaction. This distribution is presented separately on our consolidated statement of cash flows.

Comcast maintains share-based compensation plans that primarily consist of awards of stock options and RSUs to certain employees and directors as part of its approach to long-term incentive compensation. Awards generally vest over a period of 5 years and in the case of stock options, have a 10 year term. Additionally, through the employee stock purchase plans, employees are able to purchase shares of Comcast ClassA common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. Certain of our employees participate in these plans and the expense associated with their participation is settled in cash with Comcast.
The cost associated with Comcasts share-based compensation is based on an awards estimated fair value at the date of grant and is recognized over the period in which any related services are provided. Comcast uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. RSUs are valued based on the closing price of Comcast ClassA common stock on the date of grant and are discounted for the lack of dividends, if any, during the vesting period. The table below presents the weighted-average fair value on the date of grant of RSUs and ClassA common stock options awarded under Comcasts various plans to employees of NBCUniversal and the related weighted-average valuation assumptions.

NBCUniversal and our subsidiaries are not expected to incur any significant current or deferred U.S. domestic income taxes. Our tax liability is comprised primarily of withholding tax on foreign licensing activity and income taxes on foreign earnings. As a result of our tax status, the deferred tax assets and liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2013 and 2012 were not material.
In jurisdictions in which we are subject to income taxes, we base our provision for income taxes on our current period income, changes in our deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax rates, changes in estimates of our uncertain tax positions, and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities when there are temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and for the expected benefits of using net operating loss carryforwards. When a change in the tax rate or tax law has an impact on deferred taxes, we apply the change based on the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We record the change in our consolidated financial statements in the period of enactment.
We classify interest and penalties, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
Uncertain Tax Positions We retain liabilities for uncertain tax positions where we are the tax filer of record. GE and Comcast have indemnified NBCUniversal Holdings and us with respect to our income tax obligations attributable to periods prior to the close of the Joint Venture transaction, including indemnification of uncertain tax positions relating to filings made prior to the close of the Joint Venture transaction. The liabilities for uncertain tax positions included in our consolidated balance sheet were not material as of December31, 2013 and 2012.
Various domestic and foreign taxing authorities are examining our tax returns through 2012. The majority of the periods under examination relate to tax years 2004 and forward. All periods prior to January28, 2011 that are subject to audit are covered by the indemnification from GE or Comcast.

In connection with these terminations, we remitted final payments to the third-party banks that totaled $1.442 billion (the termination payments) in order to acquire $1.078 billion of accounts receivables that had been monetized and remained uncollected as of the date of the terminations and settle $364 million of cash receipts that we had collected and had not yet remitted to the banks. The termination payments are included within net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.
Prior to the terminations, we accounted for receivables monetized through these programs as sales in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance. We received deferred consideration from the assets sold in the form of a receivable, which was funded by residual cash flows after the senior interests had been fully paid. As of December31, 2012, the deferred consideration was included in receivables, net at its initial fair value, which reflects the net cash flows we expected to receive related to those interests.
Receivables Monetized and Deferred Consideration Successor December31 (in millions) 2012 Monetized receivables sold $ 791 Deferred consideration $ 274 In addition to the amounts presented above, we had $882 million payable to our monetization programs as of December31, 2012. These amounts represented cash receipts that were not yet remitted to the monetization programs and were recorded to accounts payable and accrued expenses related to trade creditors.
The net cash payments on transfers that are included within net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows were $86 million and $237 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The receivables monetization programs did not have a material effect on our consolidated statement of income for the periods presented.
Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies Commitments We enter into long-term commitments with third parties in the ordinary course of our business, including commitments to acquire film and television programming, creative talent and employment agreements, and various other television-related commitments. Many of our employees, including writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel, and others, as well as some of our on-air and creative talent, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. As of December31, 2013, the total number of full-time, part-time and hourly employees on our payroll covered by collective bargaining agreements was 7,200 full-time equivalent employees. Of this total, approximately 19% of these full-time equivalent employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements that have expired or are scheduled to expire during 2014.

This amount reflects the settlement of a $237 million liability associated with the unfavorable Olympics contract that had been recorded through the application of acquisition accounting in 2011.
(b) For the periods January1, 2011 through January28, 2011 and January29, 2011 through June30, 2011, our Theme Parks segment included the results of operations for Universal Orlando to reflect our measure of operating performance for our Theme Parks segment.
173 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K Table of Contents NBCUniversal Media, LLC (c) Headquarters and Other activities includes costs associated with overhead, allocations, personnel costs and corporate initiatives.
(d) Eliminations for the periods January1, 2011 through January28, 2011 and January29, 2011 through June30, 2011 included the eliminations of the results of operations for Universal Orlando for these periods. These results were not included in our consolidated results of operations because we recorded Universal Orlando as an equity method investment during those periods.
Also included in Eliminations are transactions that our segments enter into with one another, which consisted primarily of the licensing of film and television content from our Filmed Entertainment and Broadcast Television segments to our Cable Networks segment.
(e) No single customer accounted for a significant amount of revenue in any period.
(f) We use operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of assets, if any, as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash amortization expense that results from intangible assets recognized in connection with the Joint Venture transaction and other business combinations. Additionally, it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. We use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to NBCUniversal, net cash provided by operating activities, or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with GAAP.
(g) We operate primarily in the United States, but also in select international markets primarily in Europe and Asia. The table below summarizes revenue by geographic location.
