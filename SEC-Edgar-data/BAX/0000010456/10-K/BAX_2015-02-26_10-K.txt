Business.
Company Overview Baxter International Inc., through its subsidiaries, develops, manufactures and markets products that save and sustain the lives of people with hemophilia, immune disorders, infectious diseases, kidney disease, trauma, and other chronic and acute medical conditions. As a global, diversified healthcare company, Baxter applies a unique combination of expertise in medical devices, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology to create products that advance patient care worldwide. These products are used by hospitals, kidney dialysis centers, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, doctors offices, clinical and medical research laboratories, and by patients at home under physician supervision. Baxter manufactures products in 30 countries and sells them in more than 100 countries.
Baxter International Inc. was incorporated under Delaware law in 1931. As used in this report, Baxter International means Baxter International Inc. and Baxter, the company or the Company means Baxter International and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Business Segments and Products The company operates in two segments: BioScience and Medical Products.
The BioScience business processes recombinant and plasma-based proteins to treat hemophilia and other bleeding disorders; plasma-based therapies to treat immune deficiencies, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, burns and shock, and other chronic and acute blood-related conditions; biosurgery products; and select vaccines.
The Medical Products business manufactures intravenous (IV)solutions and administration sets, premixed drugs and drug-reconstitution systems, pre-filled vials and syringes for injectable drugs, IV nutrition products, infusion pumps, and inhalation anesthetics. The business also provides products and services related to pharmacy compounding, drug formulation and packaging technologies. In addition, the Medical Products business provides products and services to treat end-stage renal disease, or irreversible kidney failure, along with other renal therapies, which was enhanced in 2013 through the acquisition of Gambro AB (Gambro). The Medical Products business now offers a comprehensive portfolio to meet the needs of patients across the treatment continuum, including technologies and therapies for peritoneal dialysis (PD), in-center hemodialysis (HD), home hemodialysis (HHD), continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and additional dialysis services.
For financial information about Baxters segments and principal product categories, see Note16 in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Sales and Distribution The company has its own direct sales force and also makes sales to and through independent distributors, drug wholesalers acting as sales agents and specialty pharmacy or other alternate site providers. In the United States, third parties such as Cardinal Health, Inc. and Owens& Minor, Inc. warehouse and ship a significant portion of the companys products through their distribution centers. These centers are generally stocked with adequate inventories to facilitate prompt customer service. Sales and distribution methods include frequent contact by sales and customer service representatives, automated communications via various electronic purchasing systems, circulation of catalogs and merchandising bulletins, direct-mail campaigns, trade publication presence and advertising.
International sales are made and products are distributed on a direct basis or through independent distributors or sales agents in more than 100 countries.
1 Table of Contents International Operations The majority of the companys revenues are generated outside of the United States and geographic expansion remains a core component of the companys strategy. Baxters international presence includes operations in Europe (including Eastern and Central Europe), the Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Canada. The company is subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business outside the United States. For more information on these risks, see the information under the captions We are subject to risks associated with doing business globally and We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk in Item1A of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
For financial information about foreign and domestic operations and geographic information, see Note 16 in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K. For more information regarding foreign currency exchange risk, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Financial Instrument Market Risk in Item7 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Contractual Arrangements Substantial portions of the companys products are sold through contracts with customers, both within and outside the United States. Some of these contracts have terms of more than one year and place limits on the companys ability to increase prices. In the case of hospitals, governments and other facilities, these contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product or categories of products to be purchased by the customer.
In keeping with the increased emphasis on cost-effectiveness in healthcare delivery, many hospitals and other customers of medical products in the United States have joined group purchasing organizations (GPOs), or formed integrated delivery networks (IDNs), to enhance purchasing power. GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing arrangements with manufacturers and distributors, and the negotiated prices are made available to members. Baxter has purchasing agreements with several of the major GPOs in the United States. GPOs may have agreements with more than one supplier for certain products. Accordingly, in these cases, Baxter faces competition from other suppliers even where a customer is a member of a GPO under contract with Baxter. Purchasing power is similarly consolidated in many other countries. For example, public contracting authorities act as the purchasing entities for the hospitals and other customers of medical products in their region and many hospitals and other customers have joined joint procurement entities and buying consortia. The result is that demand for healthcare products is increasingly concentrated across the companys markets globally.
Raw Materials Raw materials essential to Baxters business are purchased from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business. Although most of these materials are generally available, Baxter at times may experience shortages of supply. In an effort to manage risk associated with raw materials supply, Baxter works closely with its suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. The company also seeks to develop new and alternative sources of supply where beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy. In order to produce plasma-based therapies, the company also collects plasma at numerous collection facilities in the United States and Europe. For more information on plasma collection, refer to the discussion under the caption The nature of producing plasma-based therapies may prevent us from timely responding to market forces and effectively managing our production capacity in Item1A of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
The company also utilizes long-term supply contracts with some suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the risk of price increases. Baxter is not always able to recover cost increases for raw materials through customer pricing due to contractual limits and market forces.
2 Table of Contents Competition and Healthcare Cost Containment Baxters BioScience and Medical Products businesses enjoy leading positions based on a number of competitive advantages. The BioScience business benefits from continued innovation in its products and therapies, consistency of its supply of products, and strong customer relationships. The Medical Products business benefits from the breadth and depth of its product offering, as well as strong relationships with customers and patients, including hospitals and clinics, customer purchasing groups, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and the many patients who self-administer the home-based therapies supplied by Baxter. Baxter as a whole benefits from efficiencies and cost advantages resulting from shared manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of its products.
Although no single company competes with Baxter in all of its businesses, Baxter faces substantial competition in each of its segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes. BioScience continues to face competitors from pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other companies. Medical Products faces competition from medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies. In addition, global and regional competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing channels. Competition is primarily focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product performance, and technological innovation. There has been increasing consolidation in the companys customer base and by its competitors, which continues to result in pricing and market pressures.
Global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing. Governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures, such as price controls, the formation of public contracting authorities, product formularies (lists of recommended or approved products), and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products. Sales of Baxters products are dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs, as well as insurance companies and other private payors. In the United States, the federal and many state governments have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to Medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that Baxter and other providers are required to pay to the state. In addition to government regulation, managed care organizations in the United States, which include medical insurance companies, medical plan administrators, health-maintenance organizations, hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers, continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products. Managed care organizations seek to contain healthcare expenditures, and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer, larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients. Baxter faces similar issues outside of the United States. In Europe and Latin America, for example, the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients, and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders, collective purchasing, regulating prices, setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products.
Intellectual Property Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to Baxters business. Baxter relies on patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how and confidentiality agreements to develop, maintain and strengthen its competitive position. Baxter owns a number of patents and trademarks throughout the world and has entered into license arrangements relating to various third-party patents and technologies. Products manufactured by Baxter are sold primarily under its own trademarks and trade names. Some products distributed by the company are sold under the companys trade names, while others are sold under trade names owned by its suppliers or partners. Trade secret protection of unpatented confidential and proprietary information is also important to Baxter. The company maintains certain details about its processes, products and technology as trade secrets and generally requires employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements.
Baxters policy is to protect its products and technology through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis. This protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value 3 Table of Contents for the company. Baxter also recognizes the need to promote the enforcement of its patents and trademarks and takes commercially reasonable steps to enforce its patents and trademarks around the world against potential infringers, including judicial or administrative action where appropriate.
Baxter operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent litigation. At any given time, the company is involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual property-related actions. Such litigation can result in significant royalty or other payments or result in injunctions that can prevent the sale of products. For more information on patent and other litigation, see Note15 in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Research and Development Baxters investment in research and development (R&D) is essential to its future growth and its ability to remain competitive in each of its business segments. Accordingly, Baxter continues to focus its investment in R&D programs to enhance future growth through clinical differentiation. Expenditures for Baxters R&D activities were $1.25 billion in 2013, $1.16 billion in 2012 and $946 million in 2011. These expenditures include costs associated with R&D activities performed at the companys R&D centers located around the world, which include facilities in Austria, Belgium, Sweden, Italy, Germany, China, Japan and the United States, as well as in-licensing, milestone and reimbursement payments made to partners for R&D work performed at non-Baxter locations. Included in Baxters R&D activities in 2013 were upfront and milestone payments of $103 million related to collaboration arrangements and $73 million related to business optimization charges.
The companys research efforts emphasize self-manufactured product development, and portions of that research relate to multiple product categories. Baxter supplements its own R&D efforts by acquiring various technologies and entering into development and other collaboration agreements with third parties. In July 2011, Baxter established Baxter Ventures, a strategic initiative to invest up to $200 million in early-stage companies developing products and therapies to accelerate innovation and growth for the company. Through December31, 2013, over 25% of Baxter Ventures funds have been invested, including in such therapeutic areas as immunology, hematology and renal. In addition, Baxters BioScience business has been actively engaged in investigating new potential biosimilar and oncology treatments, primarily through business collaborations. For more information on the companys R&D activities, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Strategic Objectives in Item7 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Quality Management Baxters success depends upon the quality of its products. Quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, facilitating continuous improvement of the companys processes, products and services, and assuring the safety and efficacy of the companys products. Baxter has one quality system deployed globally that enables the design, development, manufacturing, packaging, sterilization, handling, distribution and labeling of the companys products to ensure they conform to customer requirements. In order to continually improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the quality system, various measurements, monitoring and analysis methods such as management reviews and internal, external and vendor audits are employed at local and central levels.
Each product that Baxter markets is required to meet specific quality standards, both in packaging and in product integrity and quality. If either of those is determined to be compromised at any time, Baxter takes necessary corrective and preventive actions, such as notification of the customer of revised labeling, correction of the product at the customer location, withdrawal of the product from the market and other actions. For more information on corrective actions taken by Baxter, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Certain Regulatory Matters in Item7 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
4 Table of Contents Government Regulation The operations of Baxter and many of the products manufactured or sold by the company are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government agencies, both within and outside the United States. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Europe, the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) in China and other government agencies inside and outside of the United States, administer requirements covering the testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, promotion and advertising, distribution and post-market surveillance of Baxters products. The company must obtain specific approval from FDA and non-U.S.regulatory authorities before it can market and sell most of its products in a particular country. Even after the company obtains regulatory approval to market a product, the product and the companys manufacturing processes and quality systems are subject to continued review by FDA and other regulatory authorities globally. State agencies in the United States also regulate the facilities, operations, employees, products and services of the company within their respective states. The company and its facilities are subject to periodic inspections and possible administrative and legal actions by FDA and other regulatory agencies inside and outside the United States. Such actions may include warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. As situations require, the company takes steps to ensure safety and efficacy of its products, such as removing products found not to meet applicable requirements from the market and improving the effectiveness of quality systems. For more information on compliance actions taken by the company, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Certain Regulatory Matters in Item7 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
The company is also subject to various laws inside and outside the United States concerning our relationships with healthcare professionals and government officials, price reporting and regulation, the promotion, sales and marketing of our products and services, the importation and exportation of our products, the operation of our facilities and distribution of our products. In the United States, the company is subject to the oversight of FDA, Office of the Inspector General within the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG), the Center for Medicare/Medicaid Services (CMS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Defense and Customs and Border Protection in addition to others. The company supplies products and services to healthcare providers that are reimbursed by federally funded programs such as Medicare. As a result, the companys activities are subject to regulation by CMS and enforcement by OIG and DOJ. In each jurisdiction outside the United States, the companys activities are subject to regulation by government agencies including the EMA in Europe, CFDA in China and other agencies in other jurisdictions. Many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to healthcare companies in recent years. These actions appear to be part of a general trend toward increased enforcement activity globally.
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted in the United States. While this legislation provides for a number of changes in how companies are compensated for providing healthcare products and services, many of these changes are still being implemented by regulations. For more information on the expected impact of healthcare reform on the company, refer to the information under the caption The implementation of healthcare reform in the United States may adversely affect our business in Item1A of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Environmental policies of the company require compliance with all applicable environmental regulations and contemplate, among other things, appropriate capital expenditures for environmental protection.
Employees As of December31, 2013, Baxter employed approximately 61,000 people.

Item1A.
Risk Factors.
In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form10-K, shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors. If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer.
If we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
We need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives. Product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the research and development process. A successful product development process depends on many factors, including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, adapt to new technologies, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, demonstrate satisfactory clinical results, manufacture products in an economical and timely manner and differentiate our products from those of our competitors. If we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies, our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability could suffer.
We are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.
As a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the United States. The impact of this on us is direct to the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations, and indirect in that in a number of situations, even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations, our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations.
The manufacture, distribution, marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and scrutiny by FDA and other regulatory authorities globally. Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review, including additional 510(k) and other regulatory submissions, and approvals are not certain. Our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of FDA or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, could result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products, which could adversely affect our sales. The requirements of regulatory authorities, including interpretative guidance, are subject to change and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject the company to further review, result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs. For information on current 6 Table of Contents regulatory issues affecting us, please refer to the caption entitled Certain Regulatory Matters in Item7 of this Annual Report on Form10-K. In connection with these issues, there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred, that additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will not occur, that the company will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users, that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required, that sales of other products may not be adversely affected, or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect the companys operations and consolidated financial statements.
The sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. Compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (including as these laws relate to off-label promotion of products) and other healthcare related laws, as well as competition, data and patient privacy and export and import laws, is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities, including FDA, OIG, DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission. The DOJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the U.S.Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical companies. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently may be considered government officials. Foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical and medical device companies sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally. The laws and standards governing the promotion, sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments, including the Sunshine Act recently enacted under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, can be complicated, are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly. We have compliance programs in place, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring, designed to address these risks. Nonetheless, these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws. Violations, or allegations of violations, of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information related to the Companys ongoing government investigations, please refer to Note15 in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
The laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial cost associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Issues with product quality could have an adverse effect upon our business, subject us to regulatory actions and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products.
Our success depends upon the quality of our products. Quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving the companys products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products. Our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program. While we have one quality system deployed globally that covers the lifecycle of our products, quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products. A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products. Additionally, Baxter 7 Table of Contents has made and continues to make significant investments in assets, including inventory and property, plant and equipment, which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products. Product quality or safety issues may restrict the company from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments, potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future.
Unaffiliated third party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our R&D, clinical and manufacturing organizations. Third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards. Failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays, service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results. In addition, some of the raw materials employed in our production processes are derived from human and animal origins, requiring robust controls to eliminate the potential for introduction of pathogenic agents or other contaminants.
For more information on regulatory matters currently affecting us, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Certain Regulatory Matters in Item7 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
The implementation of healthcare reform in the United States may adversely affect our business.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which was signed into law in March 2010, includes several provisions which impact the companys businesses in the United States, including increased Medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program which provides certain qualified entities, such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations, with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs and medical devices. In 2011, the company became subject to a tax on the sales of its pharmaceutical products to the government, and in 2013, the company became subject to a 2.3% tax on sales of certain of its medical devices. The impact of the increased Medicaid rebates and the expanded 340B Drug Pricing Program is largely to our BioScience business, while the additional taxes impact both of our business segments. We may also experience downward pricing pressure as the PPACA reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals. While it is intended to expand health insurance coverage and increase access to medical care generally, the long-term impact of the PPACA on our business and the demand for our products is uncertain. Similarly, we cannot predict the impact of the additional regulations that need to be established to implement many of the PPACAs provisions.
If reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the United States or abroad, our business could suffer.
Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private payors. These payors include Medicare, Medicaid, and private health care insurers in the United States and foreign governments and third-party payors outside the United States. Public and private payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. We may continue to experience continued downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payors which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operational results.
Austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit, reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both our pricing flexibility and demand for our products. Accordingly, reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us.
There is substantial competition in the product markets in which we operate and in the development of alliances with research, academic and governmental institutions.
Although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses, we face substantial competition in both of our segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes. Competition is primarily focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product performance, and technological innovation.
8 Table of Contents Competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours. If our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, our products may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive. If our competitors develop more effective or affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do, our operations will likely be negatively affected. If we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition, our business could become less profitable. The companys sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with GPOs, IDNs or other customers are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise.
We also face competition for marketing, distribution and collaborative development agreements, for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions, and for licenses to intellectual property. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs. If we are unable to successfully compete with these companies and institutions, our business may suffer.
The nature of producing plasma-based therapies may prevent us from timely responding to market forces and effectively managing our production capacity.
The production of plasma-based therapies is a lengthy and complex process. Efforts to increase the collection of plasma or the production of plasma-based therapies may include the construction and regulatory approval of additional plasma collection facilities and/or plasma fractionation facilities. The development of such facilities can be a lengthy regulatory and capital intensive process. As a result, our ability to match our collection and production of plasma-based therapies to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet the market demand for our plasma-based therapies or potentially an oversupply of inventory. Failure to meet market demand for our plasma-based therapies may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products resulting in a loss of segment share or customer confidence. In the event of an oversupply we may be forced to lower the prices we charge for some of our plasma-based therapies, close collection and processing facilities, record asset impairment charges or take other action which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or if we experience other manufacturing or supply difficulties, our business may be adversely affected.
The manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials. We manufacture our products in more than 50 manufacturing facilities around the world. We acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful. Further, while efforts are made to diversify our sources of components and materials, in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier. Due to the regulatory environment in which we operate, we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or cost-effective manner, and our ability to make product sales.
Many of our products are difficult to manufacture. This is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals, including biologics, and devices, as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations. Variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed above.
9 Table of Contents Several of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility. Loss or damage to a manufacturing facility due to a natural disaster or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences. Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity due to natural disaster, regulatory action or otherwise.
If we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights, or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.
Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights, both in the United States and in other countries. We cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling certain products or including key features in the companys products.
The patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties. A loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of operations. We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive positions. Third parties may know, discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques, or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public. Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs.
If our business development activities are unsuccessful, including our integration of Gambro, our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected.
As part of our long-term strategy, we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These activities may result in substantial investment of the companys resources. Our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance; whether we are able to complete an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength of the other companys underlying technology, products and ability to execute its business strategies; any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology; and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product, technology or research into our existing operations, including the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and development projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations. Certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws, which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in the context of proposed acquisitions. If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be adversely affected.
In September 2013, we completed the acquisition of Gambro for a total purchase price of $3.7 billion, excluding adjustments for net indebtedness, which was financed in part by proceeds of approximately $3.0 billion from debt issuances in June 2013. These additional debt issuances significantly increased the companys outstanding debt and will require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow to servicing this debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund other business initiatives. The integration of Gambros operations will require 10 Table of Contents significant efforts, including the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales, marketing, operations, manufacturing and finance. These efforts will result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of managements time that cannot be dedicated to other projects. Our failure to successfully integrate Gambros operations into our own could result in a failure to achieve expected synergies. A failure to achieve our strategic objectives with respect to the Gambro acquisition could result in slower growth, higher than expected costs, the closure of facilities, the recording of asset impairment charges and other actions which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
For more information on recent business development activities, see Note 4 in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
We are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.
Our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies. These risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions, loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases, increasingly complex labor environments, availability of raw materials, changes in taxation, export control restrictions, changes in or violations of U.S.or local laws, including the FCPA and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, dependence on a few government entities as customers, pricing restrictions, economic and political instability (including instability as it relates to the Euro and currencies in certain emerging market countries), disputes between countries, diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property, and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest. Failure to comply with, or material changes to, the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk.
We generate the majority of our revenue outside the United States. As a result, our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks. We may experience additional volatility as a result of inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors in certain emerging market countries. A discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the caption Financial Instrument Market Risk in Item7 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results.
Tax policy reform continues to be a topic of discussion in the United States. A significant change to the tax system in the United States, including changes to the taxation of international income, could have an adverse effect upon our results of operations. Because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States, we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits, and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results. For more information on ongoing audits, see Note 14 in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure.
We increasingly rely upon technology systems and infrastructure. Our technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other interruption by fire, power loss, system malfunction, unauthorized access and 11 Table of Contents other events. Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others with both permitted and unauthorized access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public, or may be permanently lost. While we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology and in related training, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns, breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon the reputation, business, operations or financial condition of the company. In addition, significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities.
We may experience difficulties implementing our new global enterprise resource planning system.
We are engaged in a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system (ERP). The ERP is designed to accurately maintain the companys books and records and provide information important to the operation of the business to the companys management team. The companys ERP will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources. In implementing the ERP, we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the ERP could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship product, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business.
If we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer.
Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, including people in senior management, sales, marketing and research positions. Competition for top talent in healthcare can be intense. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including hiring practices of our competitors, compensation and benefits, work location, work environment and industry economic conditions. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees, our business could suffer.
We are subject to a number of pending lawsuits.
We are a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits. In addition, we may be named as a defendant in future patent, product liability or other lawsuits. These current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection, reduced revenue, significant liabilities and diversion of our managements time, attention and resources. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters. In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves, and, to the extent available, liability insurance. We also continue to be self-insured with respect to product liability claims. The absence of third-party insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions. Protracted litigation, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on the business, operations or financial condition of the company. Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees. See Note15 in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K for more information regarding current lawsuits.
Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition.
The companys ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the companys products, in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, or deterioration in the companys key financial ratios or credit ratings. Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our customers (including governments) to pay for our products and services, and the amount spent on healthcare generally. This could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services, declining cash flows, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. These conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers, which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products. We continue to do business with foreign governments in certain countries, including Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy, that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions. As of 12 Table of Contents December31, 2013, the companys net accounts receivable from the public sector in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy totaled $561 million (of which $29 million is related to Greece). This amount reflects an increase of $176 million during 2013 primarily as a result of the acquisition of Gambro. While the economic downturn has not significantly impacted our ability to collect receivables, global economic conditions and liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses. These conditions may also impact the stability of the Euro. For more information on accounts receivable and credit matters with respect to certain of these countries, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Credit Facilities, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings in Item7 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Description of the Company and Business Segments Baxter International Inc., through its subsidiaries, develops, manufactures and markets products that save and sustain the lives of people with hemophilia, immune disorders, infectious diseases, kidney disease, trauma, and other chronic and acute medical conditions. As a global, diversified healthcare company, Baxter applies a unique combination of expertise in medical devices, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology to create products that advance patient care worldwide. These products are used by hospitals, kidney dialysis centers, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, doctors offices, clinical and medical research laboratories, and by patients at home under physician supervision.
The company operates in two segments: BioScience and Medical Products.
The BioScience business processes recombinant and plasma-based proteins to treat hemophilia and other bleeding disorders; plasma-based therapies to treat immune deficiencies, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, burns and shock, and other chronic and acute blood-related conditions; biosurgery products; and select vaccines.
The Medical Products business manufactures intravenous (IV)solutions and administration sets, premixed drugs and drug-reconstitution systems, pre-filled vials and syringes for injectable drugs, IV nutrition products, infusion pumps, and inhalation anesthetics. The business also provides products and services related to pharmacy compounding, drug formulation and packaging technologies. In addition, the Medical Products business provides products and services to treat end-stage renal disease, or irreversible kidney failure, along with other renal therapies, which was enhanced in 2013 through the acquisition of Gambro AB (Gambro).The Medical Products business now offers a comprehensive portfolio to meet the needs of patients across the treatment continuum, including technologies and therapies for peritoneal dialysis (PD), in-center hemodialysis (HD), home hemodialysis (HHD), continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and additional dialysis services.
Baxter has approximately 61,000 employees and conducts business in over 100 countries. The company generates approximately 60% of its revenues outside the United States, and maintains over 50 manufacturing facilities and over 100 distribution facilities in the United States, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Canada.
Financial Results Baxters 2013 results reflect the companys success in meeting its financial objectives while navigating a challenging and complex macroeconomic environment. Baxter has continued to improve operational and commercial execution, while deriving significant benefits leveraging existing opportunities to bring products and therapies to various markets more effectively. Further, the company has made investments to further advance the product pipeline and position Baxter for future growth and success. The company generated significant cash flows in 2013 while maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy of returning value to shareholders through both share repurchases and increased dividends.
Baxters global net sales totaled $15.3 billion in 2013, an increase of 8% over 2012, with no significant foreign currency impact. The acquisition of Gambro in September 2013 resulted in additional net sales of $513 million, which contributed four percentage points towards total Baxter net sales growth. International sales totaled $8.8 billion, an increase of 8% compared to 2012, including an unfavorable foreign currency impact of one percentage point. Sales in the United States totaled $6.5 billion in 2013, an increase of 7% over 2012.
20 Table of Contents Baxters net income for 2013 totaled $2.0 billion, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to $2.3 billion, or $4.18 per diluted share, in the prior year. Net income in 2013 included special items which reduced income before income taxes by $744 million and net income by $555 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, as further discussed in the Results of Operations section below. Net income in 2012 included special items which reduced income before income taxes by $334 million and net income by $190 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, as further discussed in the Results of Operations section below.
Baxters financial results included R&D expenses totaling $1.2 billion in 2013, which reflects the acceleration of R&D spending to drive late-stage development programs through product approvals in both developed and emerging markets, while also focusing on enhancing the companys early-stage and exploratory R&D. During the year, Baxter continued to transform the new product pipeline into a robust portfolio of products and therapies that improve the quality of care and address key high-potential areas of unmet medical need. Additionally, included in R&D expenses in 2013 were upfront and milestone payments of $103 million related to the companys various collaboration arrangements and $73 million related to business optimization charges.
The companys financial position remains strong, with cash flows from operations totaling $3.2 billion in 2013. The company has continued to execute on its disciplined capital allocation framework, which was designed to optimize shareholder value creation through targeted capital investments, share repurchases and dividends, as well as acquisitions and other business development initiatives as discussed in Strategic Objectives below.
Capital investments totaled $1.5 billion in 2013 as the company continues to invest across its businesses to support future growth, including additional investments in support of new and existing product capacity expansions in the BioScience segment. The companys investments in capital expenditures in 2013 were focused on projects that improve the companys cost structure and manufacturing capabilities and support its strategy of geographic expansion with select investments in growing markets.
The company also continued to return value to its shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. During 2013, the company repurchased 13million shares of common stock for $913 million, and paid cash dividends to its shareholders totaling $1.0 billion.
Strategic Objectives Baxter continues to focus on several key objectives to successfully execute its long-term strategy to achieve sustainable growth and deliver shareholder value. Baxters diversified healthcare model, its broad portfolio of products that treat life-threatening acute or chronic conditions, and its global presence are core components of the companys strategy to achieve these objectives. The company continues to focus on four key strategic growth vectors: advancing the core portfolio globally, driving innovation through the R&D pipeline, enhancing growth with acquisitions and collaborations, and developing unique public-private partnerships.
Advancing the Core Portfolio Globally Baxter is well-positioned in the market, despite challenging global economic conditions, due to the breadth and diversity of the companys portfolio, which will serve as a solid foundation for future growth. In the BioScience business, the companys products treat bleeding disorders and a range of immune disorders. The Medical Products business offers innovative products for treatment of end-stage renal disease and other therapies and technologies supporting the work of hospital pharmacies and serving the needs of patients in acute care settings.
While Baxter is a leader in several of the markets noted above, there is significant potential to expand across the companys core portfolio by ensuring the cost effectiveness and improved access to Baxters products and therapies globally.
Baxter remains committed to meeting patient demands by enhancing its plasma manufacturing footprint. The company completed planned modifications at an existing Los Angeles, California plasma fractionation facility 21 Table of Contents during 2013 and continues to invest in a new manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia. The investments in the facilities in Los Angeles and Covington position Baxter well to meet the growing demand for immunoglobulin and other plasma-based therapies in both the short- and long-term.
Driving Innovation through the R&D Pipeline R&D innovation and scientific productivity continue to be key strategic priorities for Baxter. Key developments in 2013 included the following: Product Approvals and Launches  Approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Baxters FEIBA [Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Complex], the first and only FDA-approved treatment for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia A or B who have developed inhibitors.
FDA approval for RIXUBIS [Coagulation Factor IX (Recombinant)] for routine prophylactic treatment, control of bleeding episodes, and perioperative management in adults with hemophilia B.
Marketing authorization received by the European Commission for the use of HyQvia (solution for subcutaneous use) as replacement therapy for adult patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies.
Completion of CE marking in Europe for the VIVIA HD system, designed to deliver more frequent, extended duration, short daily or nocturnal home HD therapy, known as High Dose HD therapy.
Launch of HEMOPATCH Sealing Hemostat, a novel collagen-based hemostatic device, following CE mark approval in Europe.
FDA clearance and Health Canada approval for ONE-LINK Needle-Free IV Connectors featuring bonded and standard bore extension sets for use with low pressure power injectors.
Other Developments  Authorization by the European Medicines Agency for an update to the Summary of Product Characteristics for Baxters ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant) Plasma/Albumin Free Method, (in the European Union, ADVATE, octocog alfa)] to include findings of the Phase IV prophylaxis study.
Submission of a biologics license application (BLA) to FDA for the approval of OBI-1, a recombinant antihemophilic porcine sequence factor VIII, for use by patients with acquired hemophilia A.
Completion of enrollment in Phase III clinical trial of BAX 855, an investigational extended half-life, recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) treatment for hemophilia A. The ongoing trial is aimed at assessing the efficacy of the compound in reducing annual bleed rates in both prophylaxis and on-demand treatment schedules, and will also evaluate its safety and pharmacokinetic profile.
Initiation of global Phase III study of BAX 817, a recombinant factor VIIa to treat severe bleeding in hemophilia A or B patients with inhibitors to factor VIII or factor IX.
Enhancing Growth with Acquisitions and Collaborations Acquisition of Gambro On September6, 2013, Baxter acquired 100 percent of the voting equity interests in Indap Holding AB, the holding company for Gambro, a privately held dialysis product company based in Lund, Sweden. Gambro is a global medical technology company focused on developing, manufacturing and supplying dialysis products and 22 Table of Contents therapies for patients with acute or chronic kidney disease. The transaction provides Baxter with a broad and complementary dialysis product portfolio, while further advancing the companys geographic footprint in the dialysis business. In addition, the company has augmented its pipeline with Gambros next-generation monitors, dialyzers, devices and dialysis solutions. The total cash consideration for the acquisition, as reduced by assumed debt of $221 million, was $3.7 billion.
The acquisition of Gambro enhances Baxters global leadership in renal therapies and provides a number of longer-term opportunities and significant cost synergies.
Other Acquisitions and Collaboration Arrangements Baxter has accelerated its pace of acquisitions and collaborations in recent years. Key developments in 2013 included the following:  The acquisition of the investigational hemophilia compound OBI-1 and related assets from Inspiration BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. (Inspiration), as well as certain other OBI-1 related assets, including manufacturing operations, from Ipsen Pharma S.A.S. (Ipsen) in conjunction with Inspirations bankruptcy proceedings.
The execution of a global licensing agreement with Cell Therapeutics, Inc. (Cell Therapeutics) to develop and commercialize pacritinib, a novel investigational JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor with activity against genetic mutations linked to myelofibrosis, leukemia and certain solid tumors.
The execution of an exclusive collaboration agreement with Coherus Biosciences, Inc. (Coherus) to develop and commercialize a biosimilar to etanercept for Europe, Canada, Brazil and certain other markets. Baxter may select additional products in the collaboration.
The execution of an exclusive collaboration agreement with JW Holdings Corporation (JW Holdings) for parenteral nutrition products containing a novel formulation of omega 3 lipids, which provides Baxter with exclusive rights to co-develop and distribute the products globally (with the exception of Korea).
During 2013, Baxter accelerated its equity investments in companies developing high-potential technologies through Baxter Ventures, a strategic initiative established in 2011 to invest in early-stage companies developing products and therapies to accelerate innovation and growth for the company.
The company expects to continue to further supplement its internal R&D activities and pursue accelerated growth by fully capitalizing on Baxters diversified healthcare model with its investment in other business development opportunities, including acquisitions, collaborations and alliances, that complement our current businesses, enhance our portfolio, and leverage our core strengths.
Public-Private Partnerships In addition to the companys business development activities, Baxter is focused on pursuing innovation through unique business models and the development of public-private partnerships. During 2013, Baxter made advances in its existing public-private partnerships primarily through the exclusive 20-year partnership with Hemobrs to provide hemophilia patients in Brazil greater access to rFVIII therapy for the treatment of hemophilia A. Baxter recently became Brazils exclusive provider of rFVIII and will facilitate a technology transfer to support local manufacturing capacity and technical expertise. During 2013, Baxter commenced shipments of recombinant factor VIII therapy for treatment of hemophilia. Baxter expects peak annual sales related to this partnership to reach $200 million by 2017.
23 Table of Contents Responsible Corporate Citizen The company strives for continued growth and profitability, while furthering its focus on acting as a responsible corporate citizen. At Baxter, sustainability means creating a lasting social, environmental and economic value by addressing the needs of the companys wide-ranging stakeholder base.
Baxters comprehensive sustainability program is focused on areas where the company is uniquely positioned to make a positive impact.Baxter and the Baxter International Foundation provide financial support and product donations in support of critical needs, from assisting underserved communities to providing emergency relief for countries experiencing natural disasters.
Baxters priorities also include sound environmental stewardship. Throughout 2013 the company continued to implement a range of water conservation strategies and facility-based energy saving initiatives. In the area of product stewardship and life cycle management, Baxter is pursuing efforts such as sustainable design and reduced packaging. Baxter is also responding to the challenges of climate change through innovative greenhouse gas emissions-reduction programs, such as shifting to less carbon-intensive energy sources and modes of product transport.
Risk Factors The companys ability to sustain long-term growth and successfully execute the strategies discussed above depends in part on the companys ability to manage within an increasingly competitive and regulated environment and to address the other risk factors described in Item1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
24 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Special Items The following table provides a summary of the companys special items and the related impact by line item on the companys results of operations for 2013, 2012, and 2011.

Management believes that providing the separate impact of the above items on the companys GAAP results may provide a more complete understanding of the companys operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the companys results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Upfront and milestone payments related to 25 Table of Contents collaborative arrangements that have been expensed as R&D are uncertain and often result in a different payment and expense recognition pattern than internal R&D activities and therefore are typically excluded as special items.
In 2013, the company recorded pre-tax charges of $192 million associated with the acquisition and integration of Gambro and business development charges of $103 million related to upfront and milestone payments for collaboration agreements. Additionally, Baxter recorded pre-tax currency-related charges totaling $63 million in 2013 principally related to derivative instruments used to hedge the anticipated foreign currency cash outflows for the Gambro acquisition and the Venezuelan currency devaluation announced by the government of Venezuela in February 2013. In 2013, the company also recorded pre-tax charges of $17 million primarily related to remediation efforts associated with modifications to the SIGMA Spectrum Infusion Pump in conjunction with re-filing for 510(k) clearance.
Marketing and administrative expenses in 2013 included charges totaling $124 million related to tax and legal reserves associated with VAT matters in Turkey and existing class-action and other related litigation, including litigation fees. Income tax expense in 2013 included a net benefit of $6 million related to uncertain tax positions in Switzerland and Turkey. Other (income) expense, net in 2013 included the offsetting impact of $35 million in noncontrolling interest for the VAT and tax items above associated with the companys non-wholly owned joint venture in Turkey.
In 2013, 2012 and 2011, the companys results were impacted by costs associated with the companys execution of certain strategies to optimize its organizational structure, as the company implemented actions to optimize its overall cost structure on a global basis. These actions included streamlining the companys international operations, rationalizing its manufacturing facilities, improving its general and administrative infrastructure, re-aligning certain R&D activities and cancelling certain R&D programs. The company recorded pre-tax business optimization charges of $280 million, $150 million, and $192 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively, which impacted cost of sales, marketing and administrative expenses and, in 2012 and 2013, R&D expenses. The 2013 business optimization charge also included a benefit of $20 million related to an adjustment to a business optimization reserve recorded in a prior period. Refer to Note 6 for further information regarding these charges.
In 2012, the company recognized a net benefit of $23 million in cost of sales primarily related to an adjustment to the COLLEAGUE infusion pump reserve when the company substantially completed its recall activities in the United States. Refer to Note 6 for further information regarding the COLLEAGUE infusion pump charge and related reserve adjustment.
In 2012, the company also recorded pre-tax charges of $170 million primarily related to pension settlement charges and other pension-related items, and business development charges of $128 million principally related to upfront payments for collaboration agreements. Also included in 2012 results were gains of $91 million related to the reduction of certain contingent payment liabilities. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the pension settlement charges, Note 4 for further information regarding the business development charges, and Note 9 for further information regarding the gains from reductions of contingent payment liabilities.
In 2011, the company also recorded pre-tax charges of $79 million related to the resolution of litigation pertaining to average wholesale prices (AWP) and certain historical rebate and discount adjustments, $62 million in asset impairments primarily related to the write-down of Greek government bonds, and $41 million principally related to a contribution to the Baxter International Foundation.

Foreign currency unfavorably impacted net sales by 3 percentage points in 2012 principally due to the strengthening of the U.S.Dollar relative to the Euro. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, total net sales growth was 8% and 5% in 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily driven by improved sales volumes (demand).
In 2013, the acquisition of Gambro in September 2013 contributed 4 percentage points towards sales growth. In 2012, the acquisitions of Synovis and Baxa contributed 2 percentage points towards sales growth. Additionally, included in net sales in the Medical Products segment were sales of $58 million in 2011 related to the U.S. multi-source generic injectables business, which was divested by the company in the first half of 2011. The divestiture of this business unfavorably impacted total net sales growth by 1 percentage point in 2012. Refer to Note 2 for further information regarding this divestiture and Note 4 for further information regarding the Gambro, Synovis, and Baxa acquisitions.
The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior years foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net sales assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current period. The company believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net sales at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net sales at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the companys operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the companys results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.
Franchise Net Sales Reporting Effective January1, 2013, Baxter transitioned to a commercial franchise structure for reporting net sales within each segment. Prior period net sales have been reclassified to reflect the new commercial franchise structure. Refer to the segment net sales discussions below for a description of each commercial franchise.
27 Table of Contents BioScience The BioScience segment includes four commercial franchises: Hemophilia, BioTherapeutics, BioSurgery and Vaccines.
Hemophilia includes sales of recombinant factor VIII products and plasma-derived hemophilia products (primarily plasma-derived factor IX, factor VIII and inhibitor therapies). Recombinant and plasma-based hemophilia products were previously reported in separate product categories.
BioTherapeutics includes sales of the companys antibody-replacement immunoglobulin therapies and other plasma-based therapies, such as albumin and alpha-1 antitrypsin products. Antibody therapies and other plasma-based products were previously reported in separate product categories.
BioSurgery consists of biological products and medical devices used in surgical procedures for hemostasis, tissue sealing, adhesion prevention and hard tissue repair, as well as soft tissue repair and microsurgery products.
Vaccines consists primarily of vaccines for meningitis C and tick-borne encephalitis, as well as ongoing collaborations for the development of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines.
The following is a summary of net sales by franchise in the BioScience segment.
Percentchange At actual currency rates At constant currency rates years ended December 31 (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2013 2012 Hemophilia $ 3,437 $ 3,241 $ 3,216 6% 1% 7% 4% BioTherapeutics 2,118 2,069 2,002 2% 3% 2% 4% BioSurgery 717 673 580 7% 16% 6% 19% Vaccines 292 254 255 15% % 18% 8% Total BioScience net sales $ 6,564 $ 6,237 $ 6,053 5% 3% 6% 6% Net sales in the BioScience segment increased 5% and 3% in 2013 and 2012, respectively (with an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 1 percentage point in 2013 and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 3 percentage points in 2012). Excluding the impact of foreign currency, the principal drivers impacting net sales were the following:  In the Hemophilia franchise, sales growth in 2013 was driven primarily by strong demand globally for the companys advanced recombinant therapy, ADVATE, and the companys plasma-based inhibitor bypass therapy, FEIBA. Also contributing to sales growth in 2013 were shipments to Brazil as part of Baxters ongoing partnership with Hemobrs. Sales growth in 2012 was driven primarily by strong U.S. demand for ADVATE, which was partially offset by lower tender sales in Australia in 2012.
In the BioTherapeutics franchise, sales increased during 2013 primarily due to growth of immunoglobulin therapies resulting from improved product availability and accelerated demand for GAMMAGARD LIQUID [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)], albumin and Alpha-1 treatments. Sales growth was partially offset in 2013 by lower international sales as a result of an exit from certain markets due to previous supply constraints. Sales growth in 2012 was primarily the result of demand in the United States for GAMMAGARD LIQUID and the favorable impact from pricing benefits related to geographic mix as the company optimized its global supply in light of a planned, temporary shutdown during the second half of 2012.
Sales in the BioSurgery franchise in both years were favorably impacted by sales growth for Synovis, which Baxter acquired during the first quarter of 2012, and solid growth for the companys surgical sealants TISSEEL and FLOSEAL.
In the Vaccines franchise, sales growth in both years was primarily driven by higher international sales of FSME-IMMUN (a tick-borne encephalitis vaccine) and milestone payments from ongoing collaborations relating to the development of influenza vaccines.
28 Table of Contents Medical Products The Medical Products segment includes four commercial franchises: Fluid Systems, Renal, Specialty Pharmaceuticals, and BioPharma Solutions.
Fluid Systems principally includes IV therapies, infusion pumps, administration sets and premixed and oncology drug platforms. IV therapies were previously reported with nutrition products in IV Therapies, and Infusion Systems and Global Injectables were previously reported in separate product categories.
Renal consists of therapies for PD, HD, HHD and CRRT. Effective September 2013, the Renal franchise includes the results of Gambro. Refer to Note 4 for additional information.
Specialty Pharmaceuticals principally includes nutrition and anesthesia products. Nutrition products were previously reported within the IV Therapies product category and anesthesia products were previously reported as a separate product category.
BioPharma Solutions principally includes sales from the pharmaceutical partnering business and pharmacy compounding services, which were previously reported with the Global Injectables product category.
The following is a summary of net sales by franchise in the Medical Products segment.
Percentchange At actual currency rates At constant currency rates years ended December31 (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2013 2012 Fluid Systems $ 3,106 $ 2,937 $ 2,973 6% (1% ) 6% 0% Renal 3,089 2,527 2,530 22% % 24% 2% Specialty Pharmaceuticals 1,508 1,475 1,328 2% 11% 2% 14% BioPharma Solutions 992 1,014 1,009 (2% ) 1% (2% ) 2% Total Medical Products net sales $ 8,695 $ 7,953 $ 7,840 9% 1% 10% 4% Net sales in the Medical Products segment increased 9% and 1% in 2013 and 2012, respectively (with an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 1 percentage point in 2013 and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 3 percentage points in 2012). Excluding the impact of foreign currency, the principal drivers impacting net sales were the following:  In the Fluid Systems franchise, sales growth in 2013 was primarily driven by increased sales of cyclophosphamide (a generic oncology drug) due to improved pricing in the United States and strong demand for IV solutions. Sales growth in 2013 was partially offset by an expected decline in SIGMA Spectrum Infusion Pump sales due to suspension of sales to new accounts commencing with the receipt of the FDA Warning Letter in April 2013. Refer to Certain Regulatory Matters for additional information. In 2012, the favorable impact of price increases for cyclophosphamide in the United States was offset by lower global sales of access sets used in the administration of IV solutions and lower sales of SIGMA Spectrum Infusion Pumps, which principally related to the substantial completion of the COLLEAGUE infusion pump recall activities in the United States in the third quarter of 2012.
In the Renal franchise, sales in 2013 included $513 million from Gambro following the acquisition in September 2013. Excluding the impact of Gambro, sales grew 2 percent (or 4 percent on a constant currency basis) during 2013 driven by growth in the number of PD patients in the United States and emerging markets. During 2012, the favorable impact of PD patient growth in Asia, Latin America and the United States was partially offset by lower sales of HD products.
29 Table of Contents  In the Specialty Pharmaceuticals franchise, sales in both years were favorably impacted by strong, global sales of anesthetics. During 2012, sales also benefited from a favorable contribution from the fourth quarter 2011 acquisition of Baxa. During 2013, sales growth was partially offset by lower sales of nutrition products due to supplier shortages of distributed vitamins and lipids.
Sales in the BioPharma Solutions franchise declined during 2013 as a result of delayed shipments from the companys Bloomington, Indiana facility, which was partially offset by an improvement in sales during the fourth quarter of 2013 as a result of timing of orders and shipments as supply constraints were alleviated. Sales during 2012 grew primarily due to improved sales in the international pharmacy compounding business.
Gross Margin and Expense Ratios Change years ended December31 (as a percent of net sales) 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 Gross margin 49.8% 51.5% 50.7% (1.7pts ) 0.8pts Marketing and administrative expenses 24.1% 23.4% 22.7% 0.7pts 0.7 pts Gross Margin The special items identified above had an unfavorable impact of 1.3, 0.3 and 0.7 percentage points on the gross margin percentage in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. Refer to the Special Items caption above for additional detail.
In addition to the impact of the special items, the gross margin percentage in 2013 declined compared to 2012 primarily as a result of the integration of the lower margin Gambro business, which had an unfavorable impact of 0.5 percentage points on the gross margin percentage in 2013. Also contributing to the decline in the gross margin percentage during 2013 was an unfavorable impact from foreign currency, increased pension plan costs, government austerity measures and the realization of additional costs associated with modifications and the ramp-up of production at the companys Los Angeles fractionation facilities. These declines were partially offset by improved product mix and price improvements, particularly for cyclophosphamide.
In addition to the impact of the special items, the gross margin percentage in 2012 improved compared to 2011 due to the benefit from sales growth in higher margin products in the BioScience segment, the resolution of prior year manufacturing issues at the companys Castlebar, Ireland facility, and a modest favorable impact of foreign currency. These improvements in gross margin were partially offset by margin dilution from business development activities, increased pension plan costs and government austerity measures.
Marketing and Administrative Expenses The special items identified above had an unfavorable impact of 2.1, 1.7 and 1.6 percentage points on the marketing and administrative expenses ratio in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. Refer to the Special Items caption above for additional detail.
In addition to the unfavorable impact of the special items, the marketing and administrative expenses ratio in 2013 increased primarily as a result of the impact of Gambros operations since the September 2013 acquisition, which reflects a higher marketing and administrative expenses ratio for Gambro compared to Baxter. In addition to the impact of the Gambro acquisition, the marketing and administrative expenses ratio in 2013 increased as the companys focus on controlling discretionary spending was offset by increased pension costs and select investments and spending on marketing and promotional programs for new launches and to enhance the companys global presence in international markets.
In addition to the unfavorable impact of the special items, the marketing and administrative expenses ratio in 2012 increased as a result of incremental expenses from the operations of Baxa and Synovis, acquisition-related 30 Table of Contents expenses, additional spending on marketing and promotional programs, and an increase in pension plan costs as described below. These factors were partially offset by savings from the companys business optimization initiatives and the companys continued focus on controlling discretionary spending.
Pension Plan Costs Fluctuations in pension plan costs impacted the companys gross margin and expense ratios. The pension cost in 2012 included settlement charges of $168 million primarily related to the settlement of certain U.S. pension obligations. Excluding the impact of the 2012 settlement charges, pension plan costs increased $70 million in 2013 and $43 million in 2012 due to lower interest rates used to discount the plans projected benefit obligations and an increase in amortization of actuarial losses. The 2012 pension settlements resulted in savings to pre-tax income of $20 million in 2013.
The costs of the companys pension plans are expected to decrease from $336 the plans projected benefit obligations. The amortization of deferred losses is expected to decrease to $144 million from $245 million in 2013.
Business Optimization Items The company has implemented certain business optimization initiatives in an effort to streamline its international operations, rationalize its manufacturing facilities, enhance its general and administrative infrastructure and re-align certain R&D activities. In 2013, the company recorded business optimization charges of $314 million. The company estimates that the new initiatives will yield annualized savings of approximately $0.17 per diluted share when the program is fully implemented in 2015. The savings from these actions will impact cost of sales, marketing and administrative expenses and R&D expenses, and benefit both the BioScience and Medical Products segments. Refer to Note 6 for additional information regarding the companys business optimization initiatives.
The company has previously recognized business optimization charges of $150 million and $192 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively, associated with initiatives that the company estimates have resulted in annualized savings of approximately $0.13 per diluted share in 2013. The company expects additional annualized savings of approximately $0.11 per diluted share when these programs are fully implemented in 2015.
Research and Development Percentchange years ended December31 (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 Research and development expenses $1,246 $1,156 $946 8% 22% as a percent of net sales 8.2% 8.1% 6.8% R&D expenses increased in both 2013 and 2012. In addition to the special items identified above, R&D expenses increased in 2013 principally as a result of the acquisition of Gambro. Additionally, R&D expenses grew in both years due to investments made by the company to advance a number of key R&D programs in the pipeline. Refer to the discussion under Strategic Objectives above for additional detail.
Net Interest Expense Net interest expense increased by $41 million in 2013 and increased by $33 million in 2012. The increase in 2013 was principally driven by an increase in debt from the issuance of $1.0 billion of senior notes in August 2012 and $3.5 billion of senior notes in June 2013. The increase in 2012 was principally driven by an increase in debt from the issuances of $500 million 1.85% senior unsecured notes in December 2011, and $700 million 2.40% senior unsecured notes and $300 million 3.65% senior unsecured notes in August 2012, as well as lower interest income. Refer to Note 2 for a summary of the components of net interest expense for 2013, 2012 and 2011.
31 Table of Contents Other (Income) Expense, Net Other (income) expense, net was $9 million and $155 million of income in 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $83 million of expense in 2011. Refer to Note 2 for a table that details the components of other (income) expense, net for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Other (income) expense, net in each year included amounts relating to equity method investments and foreign currency fluctuations, principally relating to intercompany receivables, payables and loans denominated in a foreign currency.
During 2013, other (income) expense, net included the benefit from a net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of $31 million in 2013, which was mostly offset by foreign currency charges of $26 million and the companys bridge loan facility fee of $13 million associated with the Gambro acquisition.
During 2012, other (income) expense, net included gains of $53 million and $38 million for the reduction of certain contingent payment liabilities related to the prior acquisitions of Prism and ApaTech, respectively. Additionally, other (income) expense, net included the benefit from a net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of $28 million in 2012, which was prospectively classified as other (income) expense, net effective January1, 2012.
During 2011, other (income) expense, net included asset impairment charges totaling $62 million primarily related to the write-down of Greek government bonds.
Pre-Tax Income Refer to Note 16 for a summary of financial results by segment. The following is a summary of significant factors impacting the segments financial results.
BioScience Pre-tax income increased 5% in 2013 and decreased 4% in 2012. Included in pre-tax income during 2013 were R&D charges of $78 million primarily related to upfront and milestone payments associated with the companys collaborations with Cell Therapeutics and Coherus. Included in pre-tax income during 2012 were business development charges of $123 million, primarily related to R&D charges associated with the companys collaborations with Onconova, Chatham and Momenta, and a gain of $38 million related to the reduction of a contingent payment liability for certain milestones associated with the 2010 acquisition of ApaTech.
Excluding the impact of the above items, pre-tax income in 2013 increased by 5% primarily due to sales growth of higher margin products and the receipt of milestone payments related to ongoing collaborations for the development of influenza vaccines. The increase in pre-tax income for both periods was partially offset by increased spending on marketing and promotional programs.
Excluding the impact of the above items, pre-tax income in 2012 declined by 1% as sales growth of certain higher margin products was more than offset by an increase in spending on R&D driven by funding of key programs and the achievement of certain milestones, increased spending on new marketing and promotional programs, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency.
Medical Products Pre-tax income decreased 12% in 2013 and increased 5% in 2012. Included in pre-tax income in 2013 were Gambro acquisition and integration-related costs of $192 million, in addition to product-related charges of $16 million principally related to remediation efforts associated with modifications to the SIGMA Spectrum Infusion Pump in conjunction with re-filing for 510(k) clearance. Also included in pre-tax income in 2013 was an R&D charge of $25 million related to the companys collaboration arrangement with JW Holdings.
32 Table of Contents Included in pre-tax income in 2012 was a gain of $53 million related to the reduction of the contingent payment liability for certain milestones associated with the 2011 acquisition of Prism and a net benefit from reserve adjustments of $23 million, which primarily related to an adjustment to the COLLEAGUE infusion pump reserves.
Excluding the impact of the above items, pre-tax income in 2013 increased by 7% primarily due to a favorable impact of sales growth of higher margin products and the favorable impact from foreign currency.
Excluding the impact of the above items from 2012, pre-tax income in 2012 was flat to 2011 as the favorable impact of the resolution of prior year manufacturing issues at the companys Castlebar, Ireland facility was offset by increases in R&D spending, increases in marketing and administrative expenses, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency.
Other Certain income and expense amounts are not allocated to a segment. These amounts are detailed in the table in Note 16 and primarily include net interest expense, certain foreign exchange fluctuations (principally relating to intercompany receivables, payables and loans denominated in foreign currency) and certain foreign currency hedging activities, corporate headquarters costs, stock compensation expense, income and expense related to certain non-strategic investments, certain employee benefit plan costs (including the 2012 pension settlement charges), certain nonrecurring gains and losses, certain charges (such as business optimization, litigation, and asset impairment), and contributions to the Baxter International Foundation.
Income Taxes Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rate was 21.1% in 2013 and 20% in both 2012 and 2011. The company anticipates that the effective income tax rate, calculated in accordance with GAAP, will be approximately 21.7% in 2014, excluding any impact from additional audit developments or other special items.
The companys effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate each year due to certain operations that are subject to tax incentives, state and local taxes and foreign taxes that are different than the U.S. federal statutory rate. The average foreign effective tax rate on International pre-tax income was 18%, 17% and 15% for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The companys average foreign effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate as a result of the impact of tax incentives in Puerto Rico, Switzerland and certain other tax jurisdictions outside of the United States, as well as foreign earnings in tax jurisdictions with lower statutory rates than the United States. In addition, as discussed further below, the companys effective income tax rate can be impacted in each year by discrete factors or events. Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding the companys income taxes.
Factors impacting the companys effective tax rate in 2013 included the favorable settlement of the companys bilateral Advance Pricing Agreement proceedings between the U.S. government and the government of Switzerland with respect to intellectual property, product, and service transfer pricing arrangements, which was offset by other contingent tax matters principally related to transfer pricing. Additionally, the effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by increases in valuation allowances in respect of the tax benefit from losses that the company does not believe that it is more likely than not to realize and interest expense related to the companys unrecognized tax benefits. Partially offsetting these unfavorable items were $16 million of U.S. R&D credits. Additionally, the companys effective tax rate was impacted by a change in the earnings mix from lower tax to higher tax rate jurisdictions compared to the prior year.
Factors impacting the companys effective tax rate in 2012 were gains of $53 million and $38 million for the reduction of certain contingent payment liabilities related to the prior acquisitions of Prism and ApaTech, 33 Table of Contents respectively, for which there were no tax charges. Also impacting the effective tax rate was a cost of sales reduction of $37 million for an adjustment to the COLLEAGUE infusion pump reserves when the company substantially completed the recall in the United States in 2012, for which there was no tax charge. These items were offset by a change in the earnings mix from lower tax to higher tax rate jurisdictions compared to the prior year period.
Factors impacting the companys effective tax rate in 2011 were tax benefits from the business optimization charge, the average wholesale price (AWP) litigation and historical price reporting charge, and other charges in 2011 which were incurred in jurisdictions with rates higher than the effective rate.
Income and Earnings per DilutedShare Net income attributable to Baxter was $2.0 billion in 2013, $2.3 billion in 2012 and $2.2 billion in 2011. The corresponding net earnings per diluted share were $3.66 in 2013, $4.18 in 2012 and $3.88 in 2011. The significant factors and events causing the net changes from 2012 to 2013 and from 2011 to 2012 are discussed above. Additionally, net income attributable to Baxter per diluted share was positively impacted by the repurchase of 13million shares in 2013, 25million shares in 2012 and 30million shares in 2011. Refer to Note 11 for further information regarding the companys stock repurchases.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows from Operations Cash flows from operations totaled $3.2 billion in 2013, $3.1 billion in 2012 and $2.8 billion in 2011. The increase in cash flows in 2013 from 2012 was primarily due to the factors discussed below and was partially offset by lower earnings before non-cash items and adjustments. The increase in cash flows in 2012 from 2011 was primarily due to the factors discussed below and was partially offset by lower earnings before non-cash items and adjustments. Other non-cash items and adjustments of $42 million in 2012 included non-cash gains of $91 million from the reduction of certain contingent payment liabilities from prior acquisitions. Also included in other non-cash items and adjustments in 2012 was $113 million in R&D charges associated with upfront payments made for the execution of 2012 collaboration agreements, which have been included in cash flows from investing activities.
Accounts Receivable Cash flows relating to accounts receivable increased in both 2012 and 2013. Days sales outstanding were 55.9 days, 53.3 days and 53.5 days for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Days sales outstanding in 2013 included an unfavorable impact of 3.4 days from the acquisition of Gambro in September 2013. Excluding the impact of Gambro, days sales outstanding declined to 52.5 days in 2013 reflecting an improvement in collection periods in both the United States and certain international markets. The decrease in 2012 was due to collections of certain past due balances in Europe, partially offset by longer collection periods in the United States and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency.
Inventories Cash outflows for inventories increased in 2013 and decreased in 2012. The following is a summary of inventories at December31, 2013 and 2012, as well as inventory turns by segment for 2013, 2012 and 2011. Inventory turns for the year are calculated as the annualized fourth quarter cost of sales divided by the year-end inventory balance.
Inventories Inventory turns (in millions, except inventory turn data) 2013 2012 2013 2012 2011 BioScience $ 2,078 $ 1,745 1.49 1.48 1.52 Medical Products 1,421 1,058 4.36 4.25 4.52 Total company $ 3,499 $ 2,803 2.66 2.52 2.66 34 Table of Contents The increase in inventories in 2013 was principally due to additional inventories acquired as part of the Gambro transaction and higher levels of plasma protein-related inventories in the BioScience segment to meet growing demand.
Inventory turns for the total company increased during 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to strong sales and inventory management efforts. Inventory turns in 2013 also included the favorable impacts from purchase accounting related to the acquisition of Gambro and the business optimization charge recorded in cost of sales in 2013.
Inventory turns for the total company in 2012 were unfavorably impacted by the increase in inventories and the lower business optimization charge recorded in cost of sales in 2012 as compared to 2011. Refer to Note 6 for further information regarding these charges.
Other Cash inflows related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities were $329 million in 2013 compared to $18 million in 2012. The increase in cash inflows during 2013 was primarily driven by timing of payments to suppliers and the impact of lower litigation-related payments compared to 2012.
Payments related to the execution of the COLLEAGUE infusion pump recall and the companys business optimization initiatives decreased by $158 million and $64 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively, as the company completed its recall activities in the United States in the third quarter of 2012. Refer to Note 6 for further information regarding the COLLEAGUE infusion pump recall and the business optimization initiatives.
Cash outflows related to other balance sheet items were $103 million in 2013 compared to $171 million in 2012. The decrease in cash outflows during 2013 was primarily driven by hedging activity and lower pension plan contributions during 2013. Cash contributions to the companys pension plans totaled $67 million, $78 million and $251 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and included a discretionary cash contribution to the companys U.S. pension plan of $150 million in 2011.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures totaled $1.5 billion in 2013, $1.2 billion in 2012 and $960 million in 2011. The companys investments in capital expenditures in 2013 were primarily driven by additional investments in support of new and existing product capacity expansions in the BioScience segment. The company also invested in projects that enhance the companys cost structure and manufacturing capabilities and support the companys strategy of geographic expansion with select investments in growing markets.
In addition, the company continues to invest to support an ongoing strategic focus on R&D with the expansion of facilities, pilot manufacturing sites and laboratories. Capital expenditures also included the companys multi-year initiative to implement a global enterprise resource planning system designed to consolidate and standardize business processes, data and systems.
The company makes investments in capital expenditures at a level sufficient to support the strategic and operating needs of the businesses, and continues to improve capital allocation discipline in making investments to enhance long-term growth. The company expects to invest approximately $1.8 billion in capital expenditures in 2014, which includes Gambro-related expenditures and expected capital expenditures related to the construction of the plasma manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia.
Acquisitions and Investments Net cash outflows related to acquisitions and investments were $3.9 billion in 2013, $515 million in 2012 and $590 million in 2011.
35 Table of Contents Cash outflows relating to acquisitions and investments of $3.9 billion in 2013 principally included $3.6 billion for the third quarter acquisition of Gambro (net of cash acquired of $88 million) and a cash outflow of $51 million for the first quarter acquisition of the investigational hemophilia compound OBI-1 and related net assets from Inspiration BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. and Ipsen Pharma S.A.S. Refer to Note 4 for further information about these acquisitions. Also included in cash outflows relating to acquisitions and investments in 2013 were $130 million principally related to upfront and milestone-related payments associated with the companys collaboration arrangements with Cell Therapeutics, Coherus and JW Holdings.
The cash outflows in 2012 included $304 million associated with the acquisition of Synovis, $19 million related to the acquisition of Laboratoire Fasonut, and $50 million for an investment in the preferred stock of Onconova. Also included in cash outflows related to acquisitions and investments in 2012 were upfront payments of $113 million made to execute collaboration agreements during the period. Refer to Note 4 for further information about these acquisitions and investments.
The cash outflows in 2011 principally included $360 million related to the acquisition of Baxa (which excludes a working capital adjustment received in 2012) and $170 million associated with the acquisition of Prism, as well as an $18 million payment to exercise an option related to the companys collaboration agreement for the development of a home HD machine. Also included in cash outflows in 2011 were $18 million related to an investment in the common stock of Enobia Pharma Corporation (Enobia) and a $10 million payment related to the arrangement with Ceremed, Inc. Refer to Note 4 for further information about the Baxa and Prism acquisitions.
Divestitures and Other Investing Activities Net cash inflows relating to divestitures and other investing activities were $14 million in 2013, $107 million in 2012 and $123 million in 2011. Cash inflows in 2013 primarily related to various sales of certain investments and other assets. Cash inflows in 2012 primarily related to proceeds of $59 million from the sale and maturity of available-for-sale securities (including the sale of Greek government bonds) and $19 million from the sale of the common stock of Enobia.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities Debt Issuances, Net of Payments of Obligations Net cash inflows related to debt and other financing obligations were $3.0 billion in 2013, $765 million in 2012, and $733 million in 2011.
In June 2013, the company issued $3.5 billion of senior notes with various maturities to finance the acquisition of Gambro. Approximately $3.0 billion of the net proceeds of these debt issuances was used to finance the acquisition of Gambro in 2013 and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper. This issuance was partially offset by the repayment of $300 million of 1.8% senior unsecured notes that matured in March 2013 and payment of assumed Gambro debt of $221 million after completion of the acquisition in September 2013. Refer to Note 7 for additional information regarding the debt issuance and Note 4 regarding the Gambro acquisition.
In August 2012, the company issued $1.0 billion of senior notes, with $700 million maturing in August 2022 and bearing a 2.40% coupon rate, and $300 million maturing in August 2042 and bearing a 3.65% coupon rate. The net proceeds of the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes, which includes capital expenditures associated with previously announced plans to expand capacity to support longer-term growth of the companys plasma-based treatments, including with respect to the Covington, Georgia facility.
In December 2011, the company issued $500 million of senior notes, maturing in January 2017 and bearing a 1.85% coupon rate. In addition, during 2011, the company issued and redeemed commercial paper, of which $250 million was outstanding as of December31, 2011.
36 Table of Contents The companys debt instruments discussed above are unsecured and include certain covenants, including restrictions relating to the companys creation of secured debt.
Other Financing Activities Cash dividend payments totaled $1.0 billion in 2013, $804 million in 2012 and $709 million in 2011. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily due to an increase in the quarterly dividend rate of approximately 9% to $0.49 per share, as announced in May 2013, and the July 2012 quarterly dividend rate increase of approximately 34% to $0.45 per share, first payable on October1, 2012, partially offset by the impact of fewer common shares outstanding as a result of the companys stock repurchase program.
Proceeds and realized excess tax benefits from stock issued under employee benefit plans totaled $508 million, $512 million and $448 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The significant increase in 2012 was mainly due to increases in stock option exercises and the weighted-average exercise price. Realized excess tax benefits, which were $34 million in 2013, $24 million in 2012 and $21 million in 2011, are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as an outflow in the operating section and an inflow in the financing section.
As authorized by the board of directors, the company repurchases its stock depending on the companys cash flows, net debt level and market conditions. The company repurchased 13million shares for $913 million in 2013, 25million shares for $1.5 billion in 2012 and 30million shares for $1.6 billion in 2011. In December 2010, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the companys common stock, which was fully utilized as of December31, 2012. In July 2012, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2.0 billion of the companys common stock and $1.0 billion remained available as of December31, 2013.
Also included in financing activities in 2012 was a payment of $90 million for the exercise of the SIGMA purchase option. Refer to Note 2 for additional information.
Credit Facilities, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings Credit Facilities The companys primary revolving credit facility has a maximum capacity of $1.5 billion and matures in June 2015. The company also maintains a Euro-denominated revolving credit facility with a maximum capacity of approximately $413 million at December31, 2013. In 2013, the company amended the agreement related to this facility to extend the maturity date to December 2014. The terms of the Euro-denominated credit facility did not substantially change, however certain provisions were amended to more closely align with the companys primary credit facility. As of December31, 2013 approximately $124 million was outstanding under the Euro-denominated facility and there were no outstanding borrowings under the primary revolving credit facility. In 2012, there were no outstanding borrowings under either of these facilities. The companys facilities enable the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates, and contain various covenants, including a maximum net-debt-to-capital ratio. At December31, 2013, the company was in compliance with the financial covenants in these agreements. The non-performance of any financial institution supporting either of the credit facilities would reduce the maximum capacity of these facilities by each institutions respective commitment.
In January 2013, Baxter entered into an agreement related to a 364-day bridge loan facility with a maximum capacity of $3.1 billion in connection with the planned acquisition of Gambro. This facility was terminated in the second quarter of 2013 as a result of the companys June 2013 issuance of debt. The company recognized a $13 million expense related to bridge loan facility structuring and commitment fees in other (income) expense, net during the second quarter of 2013.
The company also maintains other credit arrangements, as described in Note 7.
37 Table of Contents Access to Capital The company intends to fund short-term and long-term obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or by issuing additional debt. The company had $2.7 billion of cash and equivalents at December31, 2013, with adequate cash available to meet operating requirements in each jurisdiction in which the company operates. The company invests its excess cash in certificates of deposit and money market funds, and diversifies the concentration of cash among different financial institutions.
The companys ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the companys products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the companys key financial ratios or credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions. However, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the companys growth objectives.
The company continues to do business with foreign governments in certain countries, including Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy, that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, the companys net accounts receivable from the public sector in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy totaled $561 million and $385 million, respectively, (of which $29 million and $66 million, respectively, related to Greece). The companys net accounts receivable from the public sector for the countries identified above increased by $176 million during 2013 primarily as a result of the acquisition of Gambro. While the economic downturn has not significantly impacted the companys ability to collect receivables, global economic conditions and liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses.
Credit Ratings The companys credit ratings at December31, 2013 were as follows.
Standard&Poors Fitch Moodys Ratings Senior debt A A A3 Short-term debt A1 F1 P2 Outlook Stable Negative Stable In 2013, Moodys upgraded the Companys outlook from negative to stable.
If Baxters credit ratings or outlooks were to be downgraded, the companys financing costs related to its credit arrangements and any future debt issuances could be unfavorably impacted. However, any future credit rating downgrade or change in outlook would not affect the companys ability to draw on its credit facilities, and would not result in an acceleration of the scheduled maturities of any of the companys outstanding debt, unless, with respect to certain debt instruments, preceded by a change in control of the company.
38 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations As of December31, 2013, the company had contractual obligations, excluding accounts payable and accrued liabilities (other than the current portion of unrecognized tax benefits), payable or maturing in the following periods.
(in millions) Total Lessthan one year One to threeyears Three to fiveyears Morethan fiveyears Short-term debt $ 181 $ 181 $  $  $  Long-term debt and capital lease obligations, including current maturities 9,020 859 1,924 1,909 4,328 Interest on short- and long-term debt and capital lease obligations 1 2,843 271 470 336 1,766 Operating leases 1,085 216 338 260 271 Other long-term liabilities 2 1,630  331 139 1,160 Purchase obligations 3 1,686 914 617 145 10 Unrecognized tax benefits 4 118 118    Contractual obligations 5 $ 16,563 $ 2,559 $ 3,680 $ 2,789 $ 7,535 1 Interest payments on debt and capital lease obligations are calculated for future periods using interest rates in effect at the end of 2013. Projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates, foreign currency fluctuations or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December31, 2013. Refer to Note 7 and Note 8 for further discussion regarding the companys debt instruments and related interest rate agreements outstanding at December31, 2013.
2 The primary components of other long-term liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet are liabilities relating to pension and other postemployment benefit plans, litigation, foreign currency hedges, and certain income tax-related liabilities. The company projected the timing of the future cash payments based on contractual maturity dates (where applicable) and estimates of the timing of payments (for liabilities with no contractual maturity dates). The actual timing of payments could differ from the estimates.
The company contributed $67 million, $78 million and $251 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Most of the companys plans are funded. The timing of funding in the future is uncertain and is dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns, changes in laws and regulations, and other variables. Therefore, the table above excludes pension plan cash outflows. The pension plan balance included in other long-term liabilities (and excluded from the table above) totaled $1.4 billion at December31, 2013.
3 Includes the companys significant contractual unconditional purchase obligations. For cancelable agreements, includes any penalty due upon cancellation. These commitments do not exceed the companys projected requirements and are in the normal course of business. Examples include firm commitments for raw material purchases, utility agreements and service contracts.
4 Due to the uncertainty related to the timing of the reversal of uncertain tax positions, the long-term liability relating to unrecognized tax benefits of $275 million at December31, 2013 has been excluded from the table above.
5 Excludes contingent liabilities, including contingent milestone payments of $2.0 billion associated with joint development and commercialization arrangements and contingent milestone payments of $446 million associated with acquisitions, as well as the companys unfunded commitment at December31, 2013 of $50 million as a limited partner in multiple investment companies. These amounts have been excluded from the contractual obligations above due to uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of future payments. Refer to Note 4, Note 9 and Note 10 for additional information regarding these commitments.
39 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Baxter periodically enters into off-balance sheet arrangements. Certain contingencies arise in the normal course of business, and are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with GAAP (such as contingent joint development and commercialization arrangement payments). Also, upon resolution of uncertainties, the company may incur charges in excess of presently established liabilities for certain matters (such as contractual indemnifications). For a discussion of the companys significant off-balance sheet arrangements, refer to Note 10 for information regarding joint development and commercialization arrangements and indemnifications, Note 9 regarding receivable securitizations and Note 15 regarding legal contingencies.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MARKET RISK The company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates. The companys hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the companys judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs. Refer to Note 8 and Note 9 for further information regarding the companys financial instruments and hedging strategies.
Currency Risk The company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to recognized assets and liabilities, forecasted transactions and net assets denominated in the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Brazilian Real, Colombian Peso, and Swedish Krona. The company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In addition, the company uses derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to foreign exchange. Gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and shareholders equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. Financial market and currency volatility may limit the companys ability to cost-effectively hedge these exposures.
The company may use options, forwards and cross-currency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and recognized assets and liabilities. The maximum term over which the company has cash flow hedge contracts in place related to forecasted transactions at December31, 2013 is 24 months. The company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge certain intercompany and third-party receivables and payables and debt denominated in foreign currencies.
In 2012, the company entered into option contracts with a total notional amount of $2.8 billion to hedge anticipated foreign currency cash outflows associated with the acquisition of Gambro. In the first quarter of 2013, the company entered into an additional $900 million of Gambro-related option contracts. These contracts matured in the second quarter of 2013 and the company entered into forward contracts with a total notional amount of $1.5 billion to also hedge anticipated foreign currency cash outflows associated with the acquisition of Gambro, which matured in the third quarter of 2013.
Currency restrictions enacted in Venezuela require Baxter to obtain approval from the Venezuelan government to exchange Venezuelan Bolivars for U.S. Dollars and require such exchange to be made at the official exchange rate established by the government. Since January1, 2010, Venezuela has been designated as a highly inflationary economy under GAAP and as a result, the functional currency of the companys subsidiary in Venezuela is the U.S. Dollar. Effective February8, 2013, the Venezuelan government devalued the official exchange rate from 4.3 to 6.3, which resulted in a charge of $11 million during 2013. As of December31, 2013, the companys subsidiary in Venezuela had net assets of $30 million denominated in the Venezuelan Bolivar. In 2013, net sales in Venezuela represented less than 1% of Baxters total net sales.
As part of its risk-management program, the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange instruments relating to hypothetical and reasonably possible near-term movements in foreign exchange rates.
40 Table of Contents A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at December31, 2013, while not predictive in nature, indicated that if the U.S.Dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against all currencies, on a net-of-tax basis, the net asset balance of $18 million with respect to those contracts would decrease by $71 million, resulting in a net liability position. A similar analysis performed with respect to option and forward contracts outstanding at December31, 2012 indicated that, on a net-of-tax basis, the net asset balance of $37 million would increase by $10 million.
The sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of the foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at December31, 2013 by replacing the actual exchange rates at December31, 2013 with exchange rates that are 10% weaker compared to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency. All other factors are held constant. These sensitivity analyses disregard the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency. The analyses also disregard the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances.
Interest Rate and Other Risks The company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. The companys policy is to manage interest costs using a mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt that the company believes is appropriate. To manage this mix in a cost-efficient manner, the company periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional amount. The company also periodically uses forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates relating to anticipated issuances of term debt.
As part of its risk management program, the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings relating to hypothetical movements in interest rates. A 31 basis-point increase in interest rates (approximately 10% of the companys weighted-average interest rate during 2013) affecting the companys financial instruments, including debt obligations and related derivatives, would have an immaterial effect on the companys 2013, 2012 and 2011 earnings and on the fair value of the companys fixed-rate debt as of the end of each fiscal year.
As discussed in Note 9, the fair values of the companys long-term litigation liabilities and related insurance receivables were computed by discounting the expected cash flows based on currently available information. A 10% movement in the assumed discount rate would have an immaterial effect on the fair values of those assets and liabilities.
With respect to the companys investments in affiliates, the company believes any reasonably possible near-term losses in earnings, cash flows and fair values would not be material to the companys consolidated financial position.
CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Refer to Note 1 for information on changes in accounting standards.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. A summary of the companys significant accounting policies is included in Note 1. Certain of the companys accounting policies are considered critical because these policies are the most important to the depiction of the companys financial statements and require significant, difficult or complex judgments by the company, often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results that differ from the companys estimates could have an unfavorable effect on the companys results of operations and financial position. The company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year. Other than changes required due to the issuance of new accounting pronouncements, there have been no significant changes in the companys 41 Table of Contents application of its critical accounting policies during 2013. The companys critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The following is a summary of accounting policies that the company considers critical to the consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition and Related Provisions and Allowances The companys policy is to recognize revenues from product sales and services when earned. Refer to Note 1 for additional information regarding the companys accounting policy for revenue recognition, including the companys accounting for arrangements in which it commits to delivering multiple products or services to its customers.
Provisions for discounts, rebates to customers, chargebacks to wholesalers, and returns are provided for at the time the related sales are recorded, and are reflected as a reduction of sales. These estimates are reviewed periodically and, if necessary, revised, with any revisions recognized immediately as adjustments to sales.
The company periodically and systematically evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts. In determining the amount of the reserve, the company considers historical credit losses, the past-due status of receivables, payment history and other customer-specific information, and any other relevant factors or considerations.
The company also provides for the estimated costs that may be incurred under its warranty programs when the cost is both probable and reasonably estimable, which is at the time the related revenue is recognized. The cost is determined based on actual company experience for the same or similar products as well as other relevant information. Estimates of future costs under the companys warranty programs could change based on developments in the future. The company is not able to estimate the probability or amount of any future developments that could impact the reserves, but believes presently established reserves are adequate.
Pension and Other Postemployment Benefit (OPEB) Plans The company provides pension and other postemployment benefitsto certain of its employees. These employee benefit expenses are reported in the same line items in the consolidated income statement as the applicable employees compensation expense. The valuation of the funded status and net periodic benefit cost for the plans is calculated using actuarial assumptions. These assumptions are reviewed annually, and revised if appropriate. The significant assumptions include the following:  interest rates used to discount pension and OPEB plan liabilities;  the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets;  rates of increases in employee compensation (used in estimating liabilities);  anticipated future healthcare costs (used in estimating the OPEB plan liability); and  other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover (used in estimating liabilities).
Selecting assumptions involves an analysis of both short-term and long-term historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of the valuation (also called the measurement date). The use of different assumptions would result in different measures of the funded status and net cost. Actual results in the future could differ from expected results. The company is not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results, but believes its assumptions are appropriate.
The companys key assumptions are listed in Note12. The most critical assumptions relate to the plans covering U.S. and Puerto Rico employees, because these plans are the most significant to the companys consolidated financial statements.
42 Table of Contents Discount Rate Assumption For the U.S. and Puerto Rico plans, at the measurement date (December 31, 2013), the company used a discount rate of 4.85% and 4.90% to measure its benefit obligations for the pension plans and OPEB plan, respectively. These discount rates will be used in calculating the net periodic benefit cost for these plans for 2014. The company used a broad population of approximately 240 Aa-rated corporate bonds as of December31, 2013 to determine the discount rate assumption. All bonds were denominated in U.S. Dollars, with a minimum amount outstanding of $50million. This population of bonds was narrowed from a broader universe of over 490 Moodys Aa rated, non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds by eliminating the top 10th percentile and bottom 40th percentile to adjust for any pricing anomalies and to represent the bonds Baxter would most likely select if it were to actually annuitize its pension and OPEB plan liabilities. This portfolio of bonds was used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the projected benefit payments for the U.S. and Puerto Rico plans. The discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve.
For plans in Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the Eurozone, the company uses a method essentially the same as that described for the U.S. and Puerto Rico plans. For the companys other international plans, the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country- and region-specific government and corporate bond interest rates.
To understand the impact of changes in discount rates on pension and OPEB plan cost, the company performs a sensitivity analysis. Holding all other assumptions constant, for each 50 basis point (i.e., one-half of one percent) increase (decrease)in the discount rate, global pre-tax pension and OPEB plan cost would decrease (increase)by approximately $53 million.
Return on Plan Assets Assumption In measuring net periodic cost for 2013, the company used a long-term expected rate of return of 7.50% for the pension plans covering U.S. and Puerto Rico employees. For measuring the net periodic benefit cost for these plans for 2014, this assumption will remain at 7.50%. This assumption is not applicable to the companys OPEB plan because it is not funded.
The company establishes the long-term asset return assumption based on a review of historical compound average asset returns, both company-specific and relating to the broad market (based on the companys asset allocation), as well as an analysis of current market and economic information and future expectations. The current asset return assumption is supported by historical market experience for both the companys actual and targeted asset allocation. In calculating net pension cost, the expected return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is a component of the total net unrecognized gain or loss and is subject to amortization in the future.
To understand the impact of changes in the expected asset return assumption on net cost, the company performs a sensitivity analysis. Holding all other assumptions constant, for each 50 basis point increase (decrease)in the asset return assumption, global pre-tax pension plan cost would decrease (increase)by approximately $18 million.
Other Assumptions The company used the RP 2000 mortality table to calculate the pension and OPEB plan benefit obligations for its plans in the United States and Puerto Rico. For all other pension plans, the company utilized country- and region-specific mortality tables to calculate the plans benefit obligations. The company periodically analyzes and updates its assumptions concerning demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover, considering historical experience as well as anticipated future trends.
The assumptions relating to employee compensation increases and future healthcare costs are based on historical experience, market trends, and anticipated future company actions. Refer to Note 12 for information regarding the sensitivity of the OPEB plan obligation and the total of the service and interest cost components of OPEB plan cost to potential changes in future healthcare costs.
43 Table of Contents Legal Contingencies The company is involved in product liability, patent, commercial, regulatory and other legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business. Refer to Note 15 for further information. The company records a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. If a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no liability is recorded. The company has established reserves for certain of its legal matters. The company is not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for certain of the legal contingencies for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved. The company also records any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring. At December31, 2013, total legal liabilities were $160 million and total related receivables were $7 million.
The companys loss estimates are generally developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on analyses of potential results. With respect to the recording of any insurance recoveries, after completing the assessment and accounting for the companys legal contingencies, the company separately and independently analyzes its insurance coverage and records any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring at the gross amount that is expected to be collected. In performing the assessment, the company reviews available information, including historical company-specific and market collection experience for similar claims, current facts and circumstances pertaining to the particular insurance claim, the financial viability of the applicable insurance company or companies, and other relevant information.
While the liability of the company in connection with certain claims cannot be estimated with any certainty, and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the companys results of operations and cash flows for that period, the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial position. While the company believes it has valid defenses in these matters, litigation is inherently uncertain, excessive verdicts do occur, and the company may in the future incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of claims.
Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowances and Reserves for Uncertain Tax Positions The company maintains valuation allowances unless it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in the companys tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, the company evaluates factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. The realizability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change in the future, particularly if earnings of a subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected, or if the company takes operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary.
In the normal course of business, the company is audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. The company believes its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and the company intends to defend its positions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the company records reserves for uncertain tax positions in accordance with GAAP, based on the technical support for the positions, the companys past audit experience with similar situations, and potential interest and penalties related to the matters. The companys results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if, upon final resolution with taxing authorities, the company prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established, or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves.
Valuation of Intangible Assets, Including IPR&D The company acquires intangible assets and records them at fair value. Valuations are generally completed for business acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis, incorporating the stage of completion and consideration of market participant assumptions. The most significant estimates and assumptions inherent in a 44 Table of Contents discounted cash flow analysis include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows, the assessment of the assets life cycle, and the competitive and other trends impacting the asset, including consideration of technical, legal, regulatory, economic and other factors. Each of these factors and assumptions can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset.
Acquired in-process R&D (IPR&D) is the value assigned to acquired technology or products under development which have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use.
Acquired IPR&D included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. Development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Upon receipt of regulatory approval of the related technology or product, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. If the R&D project is abandoned, the indefinite-lived asset is charged to expense.
R&D acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately. For such transactions, payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset, and are classified as intangible assets.
Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with R&D projects, there is no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the underlying assumptions used to prepare discounted cash flow analyses, nor that the R&D project will result in a successful commercial product.
Impairment of Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment reviews annually, and whenever indicators of impairment exist. Intangible assets with definite lives and other long-lived assets (such as fixed assets) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Refer to Note 1 for further information. The companys impairment reviews are based on an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, foreign currency exchange rates, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings, and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the companys business plans and a market participants views of the company and similar companies. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair values of the assets, and potentially result in different impacts to the companys results of operations. Actual results may differ from the companys estimates.
Stock-Based Compensation Plans Stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award, and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the substantive vesting period. Determining the appropriate fair value model to use requires judgment. Determining the assumptions that enter into the model is highly subjective and also requires judgment. The companys stock compensation costs primarily relate to awards of stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), and performance share units (PSUs). The company uses the Black-Scholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options, and significant assumptions include long-term projections regarding stock price volatility, employee exercise, post-vesting termination and pre-vesting forfeiture behaviors, interest rates and dividend yields. The fair value of RSUs is equal to the quoted price of the companys common stock on the date of grant.
In 2013, the company changed the vesting condition for 50% of the PSUs granted to senior management beginning with its 2013 annual equity awards. The vesting condition for the new PSUs is based on return on invested capital, with annual performance targets set at the beginning of the year for each tranche of the award during the three-year service period. The remaining 50% of the PSUs continued to include conditions for vesting based on Baxter stock performance relative to the companys peer group, similar to previous years. Compensation cost for the new PSUs is measured based on the fair value of the awards on the date that the 45 Table of Contents specific vesting terms for each tranche of the award are established, and the company adjusts compensation cost at each reporting date to reflect the estimated probability of achieving the vesting condition. For the remaining PSUs, the company uses a Monte Carlo model for estimating the fair value of PSUs, and significant inputs include the risk-free rate, volatility of returns and correlation of returns. Refer to Note 11 for additional information.
CERTAIN REGULATORY MATTERS In January 2014, the company received a Warning Letter from FDA primarily directed to quality systems for the companys Round Lake, Illinois, facility, particularly in that facilitys capacity as a specification developer for certain of the companys medical devices. The letter also included observations related to the companys ambulatory infusor business in Irvine, California, which previously had been subject to agency action. The company is working with FDA to resolve this matter, as well as each of the matters listed below.
In June 2013, the company received a Warning Letter from FDA regarding operations and processes at its North Cove, North Carolina and Jayuya, Puerto Rico facilities. The Warning Letter addresses observations related to Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) violations at the two facilities.
In April 2013, the company received a Warning Letter from FDA regarding the 510(k) clearance status of modifications to the SIGMA Spectrum Infusion Pump. The company subsequently has completed a new 510(k) submission related to the SIGMA Spectrum Infusion Pump.
In June2010, the company received a Warning Letter from FDA in connection with an inspection of its Renal franchises McGaw Park, Illinois facility. The Warning Letter pertains to the processes by which the company analyzes and addresses product complaints through corrective and preventative actions, and reports relevant information to FDA.

52 Table of Contents NOTESTOCONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Operations Baxter International Inc. (Baxter or the company), through its subsidiaries, develops, manufactures and markets products that save and sustain the lives of people with hemophilia, immune disorders, infectious diseases, kidney disease, trauma, and other chronic and acute medical conditions. As a global, diversified healthcare company, Baxter applies a unique combination of expertise in medical devices, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology to create products that advance patient care worldwide. The company operates in two segments, BioScience and Medical Products, which are described in Note 16.
Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Baxter and its majority-owned subsidiaries, any minority-owned subsidiaries that Baxter controls, and variable interest entities (VIEs) in which Baxter is the primary beneficiary, after elimination of intercompany transactions. During 2012, the company exercised its option to purchase the remaining equity of Sigma International General Medical Apparatus, LLC (SIGMA), which Baxter previously consolidated as the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The company has not subsequently entered into any new arrangements in which it determined that it was the primary beneficiary of a VIE, and there were no VIEs consolidated by the company as of December31, 2013. Refer to Note 2 for additional information about the SIGMA option exercise.
On September6, 2013, Baxter acquired Indap Holding AB, the holding company for Gambro AB (Gambro), a privately held dialysis product company based in Lund, Sweden, for cash consideration of $3.7 billion. Beginning September6, 2013, Baxters financial statements include the assets, liabilities, and operating results of Gambro. Refer to Note 4 for additional information.
Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period consolidated financial statements to the current period presentation.
Revenue Recognition The company recognizes revenues from product sales and services when earned. Specifically, revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred (or services have been rendered), the price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. For product sales, revenue is not recognized until title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. The shipping terms for the majority of the companys revenue arrangements are FOB destination. The recognition of revenue is delayed if there are significant post-delivery obligations, such as training, installation or other services. Provisions for discounts, rebates to customers, chargebacks to wholesalers and returns are provided for at the time the related sales are recorded, and are reflected as a reduction to gross sales to arrive at net sales.
The company sometimes enters into arrangements in which it commits to delivering multiple products or services to its customers. In these cases, total arrangement consideration is allocated to the deliverables based on their relative selling prices. Then the allocated consideration is recognized as revenue in accordance with the principles described above. Selling prices are determined by applying a selling price hierarchy. Selling prices are 53 Table of Contents determined using vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE), if it exists. Otherwise, selling prices are determined using third party evidence (TPE). If neither VSOE nor TPE is available, the company uses its best estimate of selling prices.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts In the normal course of business, the company provides credit to its customers, performs credit evaluations of these customers and maintains reserves for potential credit losses. In determining the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts, the company considers, among other items, historical credit losses, the past-due status of receivables, payment histories and other customer-specific information. Receivables are written off when the company determines they are uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $169 million at December31, 2013 and $127 million at December31, 2012.
Product Warranties The company provides for the estimated costs relating to product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The cost is determined based on actual company experience for the same or similar products, as well as other relevant information. Product warranty liabilities are adjusted based on changes in estimates.
Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents include cash, certificates of deposit and money market funds with an original maturity of three months or less.
Inventories as of December31 (in millions) 2013 2012 Raw materials $ 920 $ 765 Work in process 1,136 898 Finished goods 1,443 1,140 Inventories $ 3,499 $ 2,803 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market value. Market value for raw materials is based on replacement costs, and market value for work in process and finished goods is based on net realizable value. The company reviews inventories on hand at least quarterly and records provisions for estimated excess, slow-moving and obsolete inventory, as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of net realizable value.
Property, Plant and Equipment, Net as of December31 (in millions) 2013 2012 Land $ 220 $ 190 Buildings and leasehold improvements 2,670 2,181 Machinery and equipment 7,360 6,691 Equipment with customers 1,361 1,295 Construction in progress 2,184 1,512 Total property, plant and equipment, at cost 13,795 11,869 Accumulated depreciation (5,963 ) (5,771 ) Property, plant and equipment (PP&E), net $ 7,832 $ 6,098 Depreciation expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 20 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and from three to 15 years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the related facility lease 54 Table of Contents (including any renewal periods, if appropriate) or the asset, whichever is shorter. Baxter capitalizes certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use as part of machinery and equipment. Capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, and are included in depreciation expense below. Straight-line and accelerated methods of depreciation are used for income tax purposes. Depreciation expense was $681 million in 2013, $597 million in 2012 and $572 million in 2011. Repairs and maintenance expense was $351 million in 2013, $297 million in 2012 and $269 million in 2011.
Acquisitions Results of operations of acquired companies are included in the companys results of operations as of the respective acquisition dates. The purchase price of each acquisition is allocated to the net assets acquired based on estimates of their fair values at the date of the acquisition. Any purchase price in excess of these net assets is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of purchase price in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair values during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date.
Contingent consideration is recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent payments are recognized in earnings. Contingent payments related to acquisitions consist of regulatory, development and commercial milestone payments, in addition to sales-based payments, and are valued using discounted cash flow techniques. The fair value of development and commercial milestone payments reflects managements expectations of probability of payment, and increases as the probability of payment increases or expectation of timing of payments is accelerated. The fair value of sales-based payments is based upon probability-weighted future revenue estimates, and increases as revenue estimates increase, probability weighting of higher revenue scenarios increases or expectation of timing of payment is accelerated.
Research and Development Research and development (R&D) costs are expensed as incurred. Acquired in-process R&D (IPR&D) is the value assigned to technology or products under development acquired in a business combination which have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use. Valuations are generally completed for business acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis, incorporating the stage of completion and consideration of market participant assumptions. The most significant estimates and assumptions inherent in a discounted cash flow analysis include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to measure the risks inherent in future cash flows, the assessment of the assets life cycle, and competitive and other trends impacting the asset, including consideration of technical, legal, regulatory, economic and other factors. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the IPR&D.
Acquired IPR&D is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. Development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Upon receipt of regulatory approval of the related technology or product, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the related product, subject to impairment reviews as discussed below. If the R&D project is abandoned, the indefinite-lived asset is charged to expense.
R&D acquired in transactions that are not business acquisitions is expensed immediately. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized over the remaining estimated economic life of the related product.
Collaborative Arrangements In the normal course of business, Baxter enters into collaborative arrangements with third parties. Certain of these collaborative arrangements include joint operating activities involving active participation by both partners, where both Baxter and the other entity are exposed to risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of 55 Table of Contents the activity. These collaborative arrangements exist in both of the companys segments, take a number of forms and structures, principally pertain to the joint development and commercialization of new products, and are designed to enhance and expedite long-term sales and profitability growth.
The companys joint product development and commercialization arrangements generally provide that Baxter license certain rights to develop, market, and sometimes manufacture, a product under development. Baxters consideration for the rights generally consists of some combination of upfront payments, contingent milestone payments relating to the achievement of specified development, clinical, regulatory and sales milestones, and royalties. Baxter may also be responsible for ongoing R&D cost reimbursements and costs associated with certain development, manufacturing and commercial activities associated with these arrangements. Joint steering committees exist to manage the various stages and activities of the arrangement. Control over the R&D activities may be shared, may be held by Baxter, or may be held by the partner, and governance may contractually change during the development or later periods. Baxter typically controls the commercialization phase, sometimes purchasing inventories from the collaboration partner.
During the development phase, Baxters R&D costs are expensed as incurred. These costs may include upfront and milestone payments made to the partner prior to the date the product receives regulatory approval, in addition to potential R&D cost reimbursements. Milestone payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as other intangible assets and amortized to cost of sales over the estimated economic life of the related product. Royalty payments are expensed as cost of sales when they become due and payable. Any purchases of inventory from the partner during the development stage are expensed as R&D, while such purchases during the commercialization phase are capitalized as inventory and recognized as cost of sales when the related finished products are sold. Baxter generally records the amount invoiced to the third-party customer for the finished product as sales, as Baxter is the principal and primary obligor in the arrangement.
Payments to collaborative partners classified in cost of sales were not significant in 2013, 2012 and 2011. Payments to collaborative partners classified in R&D expenses were $129 million, $138 million and $18 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In 2013 and 2012, the payments related primarily to upfront payments for the business development arrangements described in Note 4. In 2011, the payments primarily related to the development of longer-acting forms of blood clotting proteins to treat hemophilia and a home hemodialysis (HHD) device.
Business Optimization Charges The company records liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities in the period in which the liability is incurred. Employee termination costs are primarily recorded when actions are probable and estimable. Costs for one-time termination benefits in which the employee is required to render service until termination in order to receive the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period. Refer to the discussion below regarding the accounting for asset impairment charges.
Impairment Reviews Baxter has made and continues to make significant investments in assets, including inventory and PP&E, which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products. Additionally, Baxter has made and continues to make significant investments related to business development activities, which result in the acquisition of certain intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The companys ability to realize value from these investments is contingent on, among other things, regulatory approvals, market acceptance of these new or modified products, and realization of synergies associated with business acquisitions. The company may not be able to realize the expected returns from these investments, potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future.
Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an impairment review annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist. Goodwill would be impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit, calculated as the present value of estimated cash flows discounted using a risk-free market 56 Table of Contents rate adjusted for a market participants view of similar companies and perceived risks in the cash flows. The implied fair value of goodwill is then determined by subtracting the fair value of all identifiable net assets other than goodwill from the fair value of the reporting unit, with an impairment charge recorded for the excess, if any, of carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value.
The company assesses goodwill for impairment based on its reporting units, which are the same as its operating segments, BioScience and Medical Products. As of December31, 2013, the date of the companys annual impairment review, the fair values of the companys reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values.
Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization Indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as trademarks with indefinite lives and certain acquired IPR&D, are subject to an impairment review annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist. Indefinite-lived intangible assets would be impaired if the carrying amount of the asset exceeded the fair value of the asset.
Other Long-Lived Assets The company reviews the carrying amounts of long-lived assets, other than goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization, for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Examples of such a change in circumstances include a significant decrease in market price, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used, or a significant adverse change in the legal or business climate. In evaluating recoverability, the company groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level such that the identifiable cash flows relating to the group are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The company then compares the carrying amounts of the assets or asset groups with the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows. In the event impairment exists, an impairment charge is recorded as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value. Depending on the asset and the availability of information, fair value may be determined by reference to estimated selling values of assets in similar condition, or by using a discounted cash flow model. In addition, the remaining amortization period for the impaired asset would be reassessed and, if necessary, revised.
Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping costs, which are costs incurred to physically move product from Baxters premises to the customers premises, are classified as marketing and administrative expenses. Handling costs, which are costs incurred to store, move and prepare products for shipment, are classified as cost of sales. Approximately $293 million in 2013, $265 million in 2012 and $260 million in 2011 of shipping costs were classified in marketing and administrative expenses.
Income Taxes Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting based on enacted tax laws and rates. The company maintains valuation allowances unless it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. With respect to uncertain tax positions, the company determines whether the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. Any tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured and recognized in the consolidated financial statements at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The liability relating to uncertain tax positions is classified as current in the consolidated balance sheets to the extent the company anticipates making a payment within one year.Interest and penalties associated with income taxes are classified in the income tax expense line in the consolidated statements of income.
57 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Translation Currency translation adjustments (CTA) related to foreign operations are included in other comprehensive income (OCI). For foreign operations in highly inflationary economies, translation gains and losses are included in other (income) expense, net, and were not material in 2013, 2012 and 2011.
Derivatives and Hedging Activities All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets and are classified as short-term or long-term based on the scheduled maturity of the instrument. Based upon the exposure being hedged, the company designates its hedging instruments as cash flow or fair value hedges.
For each derivative instrument that is designated and effective as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is accumulated in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and then recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged item. Option premiums or net premiums paid are initially recorded as assets and reclassified to OCI over the life of the option, and then recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flow hedges are classified in net sales, cost of sales, and net interest expense, and primarily related to forecasted third-party sales denominated in foreign currencies, forecasted intercompany sales denominated in foreign currencies and anticipated issuances of debt, respectively.
For each derivative instrument that is designated and effective as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized immediately to earnings, and offsets the loss or gain on the underlying hedged item. Fair value hedges are classified in net interest expense, as they hedge the interest rate risk associated with certain of the companys fixed-rate debt.
For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, the change in fair value is recorded directly to other (income) expense, net.
If it is determined that a derivative or nonderivative hedging instrument is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. If the company removes the cash flow hedge designation because the hedged forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring, any gains or losses are immediately reclassified from AOCI to earnings. Gains or losses relating to terminations of effective cash flow hedges in which the forecasted transactions are still probable of occurring are deferred and recognized consistent with the income or loss recognition of the underlying hedged items. If the company terminates a fair value hedge, an amount equal to the cumulative fair value adjustment to the hedged items at the date of termination is amortized to earnings over the remaining term of the hedged item.
Derivatives, including those that are not designated as a hedge, are principally classified in the operating section of the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same category as the related consolidated balance sheet account.
Refer to Note 8 for further information regarding the companys derivative and hedging activities.
Changes in Accounting Standards Effective January1, 2013, the company has prospectively adopted new accounting guidance that requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of AOCI on the respective line items in the consolidated statement of income. Refer to Note 13 for related disclosures.
On January1, 2012, the company adopted a new accounting standard which eliminated the companys previous election to present other comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of changes in equity, and provided the option to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement of comprehensive income or as two separate but consecutive statements.The standard is reflected in the companys consolidated statements of comprehensive income, presented as a separate consecutive statement to the consolidated statements of income, and was retrospectively applied to all prior periods presented.

During 2012, the company recorded gains of $53 million and $38 million related to the reduction of contingent payment liabilities for certain milestones associated with the 2011 acquisition of Prism Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Prism) and the 2010 acquisition of ApaTech Limited (ApaTech), respectively. The $53 million gain related to the Prism acquisition was included in the Medical Products segments pre-tax income and the $38 million gain related to the ApaTech acquisition was included in the BioScience segments pre-tax income. Refer to Note 9 for further information about these gains.
During 2011, the company recorded impairment charges of $62 million principally related to the write-down of the companys Greek government bonds, which was recorded at the corporate level and not allocated to a segment.
Sale of Business In May 2011, the company completed the divestiture of its U.S. multi-source generic injectables business to Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC (Hikma). The consideration for the divestiture arrangement totaled $104 million, after closing-related adjustments. Hikma acquired Baxters high-volume, multi-source generic injectable products in vials and ampoules, including chronic pain, anti-infective and anti-emetic products, along with a manufacturing facility located in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and a warehouse and distribution center located in Memphis, Tennessee.
Net sales related to the U.S. multi-source generic injectables business, which were reported in the Medical Products segment prior to the divestiture, totaled $58 million in 2011. Pre-tax earnings related to this business were not significant to Baxters consolidated financial statements in 2011.
Exercise of SIGMA Option In April 2012, the company exercised its option to purchase the remaining equity of SIGMA for a cash payment of $90 million. Since the 2009 acquisition of a 40% stake in SIGMA, the company has consolidated the financial statements of SIGMA, with the equity owned by existing SIGMA equity holders reported as noncontrolling interests. As a result, the exercise of the option was treated as an equity transaction and no additional assets were recognized by Baxter related to the additional ownership interest acquired. On the date of exercise, the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest was eliminated to reflect Baxters change in ownership interest in SIGMAs equity and the carrying value of the call option was also eliminated. The exercise of the SIGMA purchase option had no direct impact on the companys results of operations, and the payment was classified as a financing activity on the consolidated statement of cash flows. Effective as of the date of the option exercise, 100% of SIGMAs pre-tax income has been reflected in the companys results of operations and, as a result, the company no longer reports noncontrolling interest related to SIGMA.
60 Table of Contents NOTE 3 EARNINGS PER SHARE The numerator for both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) is net income attributable to Baxter. The denominator for basic EPS is the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs) is reflected in the denominator for diluted EPS using the treasury stock method.
The following is a reconciliation of basic shares to diluted shares.

The computation of diluted EPS excluded stock options to purchase 5million, 16million and 19million shares in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect on diluted EPS. Refer to Note 11 for additional information regarding items impacting basic shares.
NOTE 4 ACQUISITIONS AND COLLABORATIONS Acquisition of Gambro Description of transaction On September6, 2013, Baxter acquired 100 percent of the voting equity interests in Indap Holding AB, the holding company for Gambro, a privately held dialysis product company based in Lund, Sweden. Gambro is a global medical technology company focused on developing, manufacturing and supplying dialysis products and therapies for patients with acute or chronic kidney disease.

Fair value of consideration transferred and net assets acquired The total cash consideration for the acquisition, as reduced by assumed debt of $221 million, was $3.7 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the company substantially completed its valuation of the consideration transferred and certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. As a result, Baxter adjusted its preliminary estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date to reflect the updated valuations. The measurement period adjustments included reductions of $360 million, $128 million and $118 million to other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and other long-term liabilities, respectively, in addition to other immaterial adjustments to working capital. The adjustments above resulted in a corresponding increase in goodwill of $368 million. The measurement period adjustments did not have a material impact on Baxters results of operations in 2013.

The company recognized a $13 million expense related to bridge loan facility structuring and commitment fees in other (income) expense, net during the second quarter of 2013.
Leases The company leases certain facilities and equipment under capital and operating leases expiring at various dates. The leases generally provide for the company to pay taxes, maintenance, insurance and certain other operating costs of the leased property. Most of the operating leases contain renewal options. Operating lease rent expense was $214 million in 2013, $202 million in 2012 and $203 million in 2011.

The companys hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the companys judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs.
The company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to recognized assets and liabilities, forecasted transactions and net assets denominated in the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Brazilian Real, Colombian Peso and Swedish Krona. The company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In addition, the company uses derivative and nonderivative instruments to further reduce the net exposure to foreign exchange. Gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and equity volatility resulting from foreign exchange. Financial market and currency volatility may limit the companys ability to cost-effectively hedge these exposures.
The company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. The companys policy is to manage interest costs using a mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt that the company believes is appropriate. To manage this mix in a cost-efficient manner, the company periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional amount.
The company does not hold any instruments for trading purposes and none of the companys outstanding derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features.
Cash Flow Hedges The company may use options, including collars and purchased options, forwards and cross-currency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions and recognized assets and liabilities. The company periodically uses forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to hedge the risk to earnings associated with movements in interest rates relating to anticipated issuances of debt. Certain other firm commitments and forecasted transactions are also periodically hedged. Cash flow hedges primarily related to forecasted intercompany sales denominated in foreign currencies, and anticipated issuances of debt.
72 Table of Contents The notional amounts of foreign exchange contracts were $2.1 billion and $1.5 billion as of December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The company did not have any interest rate contracts designated as cash flow hedges outstanding at December31, 2013. As of December31, 2012, $250 million of interest rate contracts designated as cash flow hedges were outstanding. The maximum term over which the company has cash flow hedge contracts in place related to forecasted transactions at December31, 2013 is 24 months.
Fair Value Hedges The company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. These instruments hedge the companys earnings from changes in the fair value of debt due to fluctuations in the designated benchmark interest rate.
The total notional amount of interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges was $1.2 billion and $500 million as of December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Dedesignations In 2013, the company had $1 billion of interest rate contracts designated as cash flow hedges that matured or were terminated, resulting in a net gain of $5 million that was deferred in AOCI.The company determined that certain forecasted transactions associated with these contracts were no longer probable of occurring and therefore dedesignated the hedge relationship, which, together with ineffectiveness, resulted in the immediate reclassification of a net gain of $11 million from AOCI to net interest expense.The remaining deferred net loss of $6 million from the matured or terminated interest rate contracts is being amortized as an increase to net interest expense over the remaining terms of the underlying debt.
The company terminated $175 million of interest rate contracts in 2012, which had been designated as fair value hedges. The termination resulted in a net gain of $21 million in 2012 that was deferred and is being amortized as a reduction of net interest expense over the remaining terms of the underlying debt.
There were no hedge dedesignations in 2012 resulting from changes in the companys assessment of the probability that the hedged forecasted transactions would occur.
Undesignated Derivative Instruments The company uses forward contracts to hedge earnings from the effects of foreign exchange relating to certain of the companys intercompany and third-party receivables and payables denominated in a foreign currency. These derivative instruments are generally not formally designated as hedges and the terms of these instruments generally do not exceed one month.
The total notional amount of undesignated derivative instruments was $381 million as of December31, 2013 and $3.2 billion as of December31, 2012. In the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013, the company entered into option contracts with a total notional amount of $3.7 billion to hedge anticipated foreign currency cash outflows associated with the planned acquisition of Gambro. These contracts matured in June 2013, and in the second quarter of 2013, the company entered into undesignated forward contracts with a total notional amount of $1.5 billion also to hedge anticipated foreign currency cash outflows associated with the planned acquisition of Gambro, which matured in 2013.
The company recorded losses of $23 million in 2013 associated with the Gambro-related option and forward contracts.

The company continues to service the receivables in its Japanese securitization arrangement. Servicing assets or liabilities are not recognized because the company receives adequate compensation to service the sold receivables. The Japanese securitization arrangement includes limited recourse provisions, which are not material.
The following is a summary of the activity relating to the securitization arrangement.

Concentrations of Credit Risk The company invests excess cash in certificates of deposit or money market funds and diversifies the concentration of cash among different financial institutions. With respect to financial instruments, where appropriate, the company has diversified its selection of counterparties, and has arranged collateralization and master-netting agreements to minimize the risk of loss.
The company continues to do business with foreign governments in certain countries, including Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy, that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, the companys net accounts receivable from the public sector in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy totaled $561 million and $385 million, respectively, (of which $29 million and $66 million, respectively, related to Greece). The companys net accounts receivable from the public sector for the countries identified above increased by $176 million during 2013 primarily as a result of the acquisition of Gambro. Refer to the discussion below for information regarding the Greek government bonds previously held by the company.
Global economic conditions and liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses. Global economic conditions, governmental actions and customer-specific factors may require the company to re-evaluate the collectibility of its receivables and the company could potentially incur additional credit losses. These conditions may also impact the stability of the Euro.
Fair Value Measurements The fair value hierarchy under the accounting standard for fair value measurements consists of the following three levels:  Level1  Quoted prices in active markets that the company has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities;  Level2  Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market; and  Level3  Valuations using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and include the use of judgment by the companys management about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
76 Table of Contents The following tables summarize the bases used to measure financial assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets.

For assets that are measured using quoted prices in active markets, the fair value is the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held, without consideration of transaction costs. The majority of the derivatives entered into by the company are valued using internal valuation techniques as no quoted market prices exist for such instruments. The principal techniques used to value these instruments are discounted cash flow and Black-Scholes models. The key inputs are considered observable and vary depending on the type of derivative, and include contractual terms, interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates and volatility. The fair 77 Table of Contents values of foreign government debt securities are obtained from pricing services or broker/dealers who use proprietary pricing applications, which include observable market information for like or same securities. The preferred stock is valued based upon recent transactions, as well as the financial information of the investee.
Contingent payments related to acquisitions consist of regulatory, development and commercial milestone payments, in addition to sales-based payments, and are valued using discounted cash flow techniques. The fair value of regulatory, development and commercial milestone payments reflects managements expectations of probability of payment, and increases as the probability of payment increases or expectation of timing of payments is accelerated. As of December31, 2013, managements expected weighted-average probability of payment for regulatory, development and commercial milestone payments expected to occur was approximately 64%. The fair value of sales-based payments is based upon probability-weighted future revenue estimates, and increases as revenue estimates increase, probability weighting of higher revenue scenarios increase or expectation of timing of payment is accelerated.
At December31, 2013, the company held available-for-sale equity securities that had an amortized cost basis and fair value of $111 million and $102 million, respectively. The company had net unrealized losses of $9 million, comprised of unrealized losses of $31 million, which are temporary in nature, and unrealized gains of $22 million. At December31, 2012, the amortized cost basis and fair value of the available-for-sale equity securities was $13 million and $15 million, respectively, with $2 million in cumulative unrealized gains. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, the cumulative unrealized gains for the companys available-for-sale debt securities were less than $1 million.
In July 2012, Baxter acquired approximately 3million shares of Onconova preferred stock for $50 million, which the company classified as available-for-sale debt securities as a result of certain mandatory redemption rights held by Baxter. In 2013, Baxter reclassified the securities to available-for-sale equity securities as a result of the conversion of the preferred stock to common stock upon the completion of Onconovas initial public offering.
The company recognized losses totaling $8 million in 2012 related to unrealized and realized losses associated with the companys Greek government and European Financial Stability Facility bonds, which Baxter sold for $14 million in the second quarter of 2012.
In February 2012, as a result of the companys acquisition of Synovis, the company acquired marketable securities, which included municipal securities, corporate bonds, and U.S. government agency issues, which had been classified as available-for-sale, with primarily all of these securities maturing within one year. The company received proceeds of $45 million from the sale and maturity of all of these securities in 2012.
Refer to Note 12 for fair value disclosures related to the companys pension plans.
The following table is a reconciliation of the fair value measurements that use significant unobservable inputs (Level3), which consist of contingent payments related to acquisitions and preferred stock.

The companys payments in 2012 principally related to milestones associated with the SIGMA agreement. The gains recognized in earnings in 2012 included $38 million related to the reduction of the contingent payment liabilities for certain milestones associated with ApaTech. In addition, 2012 includes a $53 million gain recognized in earnings related to a reduction of the contingent payment liabilities for certain milestones associated with the 2011 acquisition of Prism. These gains were reported in other (income) expense, net. The contingent liabilities were reduced based on updated information indicating that the probability of achieving certain milestones was lower than previously expected.
As discussed further in Note 6, the company recorded asset impairment charges related to its COLLEAGUE and SYNDEO infusion pumps and business optimization initiatives in 2013, 2012, and 2011. As these assets had no alternative use and no salvage value, the fair values, measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), were assessed to be zero.
Book Values and Fair Values of Financial Instruments In addition to the financial instruments that the company is required to recognize at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets, the company has certain financial instruments that are recognized at historical cost or some basis other than fair value. For these financial instruments, the following table provides the values recognized on the consolidated balance sheets and the approximate fair values.

The discount factors used in the calculations reflect the non-performance risk of the insurance providers and the company, respectively.
Investments in 2013 and 2012 include certain cost method investments and held-to-maturity debt securities.
The fair value of held-to-maturity debt securities is calculated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates observable inputs, including interest rate yields, which represents a Level 2 basis of fair value measurement. In determining the fair value of cost method investments, the company takes into consideration recent transactions, as well as the financial information of the investee, which represents a Level 3 basis of fair value measurement.
The estimated fair values of current and long-term debt were computed by multiplying price by the notional amount of the respective debt instrument. Price is calculated using the stated terms of the respective debt instrument and yield curves commensurate with the companys credit risk. The carrying values of the other financial instruments approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturities of most of these assets and liabilities.
NOTE 10 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Joint Development and Commercialization Arrangements As discussed in Note 1, the company has entered into certain collaborative arrangements which include contingent milestone payments. At December31, 2013, the companys unfunded contingent milestone payments associated with all of its arrangements totaled $2.0 billion. This total excludes any contingent royalties. Based on the companys projections, any contingent payments made in the future will be more than offset over time by the estimated net future cash flows relating to the rights acquired for those payments. The majority of the contingent payments relate to arrangements in the BioScience segment and principally relate to the business development arrangements described in Note 4.
Other Commitments In connection with the companys initiative to invest in early-stage products and therapies, the company has unfunded commitments of $50 million as a limited partner in multiple investment companies as of December31, 2013.
80 Table of Contents Indemnifications During the normal course of business, Baxter makes indemnities, commitments and guarantees pursuant to which the company may be required to make payments related to specific transactions. Indemnifications include: (i)intellectual property indemnities to customers in connection with the use, sales or license of products and services; (ii)indemnities to customers in connection with losses incurred while performing services on their premises; (iii)indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct; and (iv)indemnities involving the representations and warranties in certain contracts. In addition, under Baxters Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and consistent with Delaware General Corporation Law, the company has agreed to indemnify its directors and officers for certain losses and expenses upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events. The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum potential for future payments that the company could be obligated to make. To help address some of these risks, the company maintains various insurance coverages. Based on historical experience and evaluation of the agreements, the company does not believe that any significant payments related to its indemnities will occur, and therefore the company has not recorded any associated liabilities.
Legal Contingencies Refer to Note 15 for a discussion of the companys legal contingencies.
NOTE 11 SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY Stock-Based Compensation The companys stock-based compensation generally includes stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance share units (PSUs) and purchases under the companys employee stock purchase plan. Shares issued relating to the companys stock-based plans are generally issued out of treasury stock.
In 2011, shareholders approved the Baxter International Inc. 2011 Incentive Plan which provides for 40million additional shares of common stock available for issuance with respect to awards for participants. As of December31, 2013, approximately 40million authorized shares are available for future awards under the companys stock-based compensation plans.
Stock Compensation Expense Stock compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income was $150 million, $130 million and $119 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The related tax benefit recognized was $45 million in 2013, $40 million in 2012 and $36 million in 2011.
Stock compensation expense is recorded at the corporate level and is not allocated to a segment. Over 70% of stock compensation expense is classified in marketing and administrative expenses, with the remainder classified in cost of sales and R&D expenses. Costs capitalized in the consolidated balance sheets at December31, 2013 and 2012 were not significant.
Stock compensation expense is based on awards expected to vest, and therefore has been reduced by estimated forfeitures.
Stock Options Stock options are granted to employees and non-employee directors with exercise prices at least equal to 100% of the market value on the date of grant. Stock options granted to employees generally vest in one-third increments over a three-year period. Stock options granted to non-employee directors generally cliff-vest 100% 81 Table of Contents one year from the grant date. Stock options typically have a contractual term of 10 years. The grant-date fair value, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the substantive vesting period.
The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes model. The weighted-average assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted during each year, along with the weighted-average grant-date fair values, were as follows.
years ended December31 2013 2012 2011 Expected volatility 25% 25% 25% Expected life (in years) 5.5 5.5 5.0 Risk-free interest rate 0.9% 1.0% 2.2% Dividend yield 2.6% 2.3% 2.3% Fair value per stock option $12 $10 $10 Effective with the March 2012 annual stock compensation grants, the companys expected volatility assumption is based on a weighted-average of the historical volatility of Baxters stock and the implied volatility from traded options on Baxters stock, with historical volatility more heavily weighted. Prior to the March 2012 grants, the expected volatility assumption was based on an equal weighting of the historical and implied volatilities. The expected life assumption is primarily based on the vesting terms of the stock option, historical employee exercise patterns and employee post-vesting termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate for the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield reflects historical experience as well as future expectations over the expected life of the option.
The following table summarizes stock option activity for the year ended December31, 2013 and stock option information at December31, 2013.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $176 million, $129 million and $102 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
As of December31, 2013, $58 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.6 years.
RSUs RSUs are granted to employees and non-employee directors. RSUs granted to employees generally vest in one-third increments over a three-year period. RSUs granted to non-employee directors generally cliff-vest one year from the grant date. The grant-date fair value, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, is recognized as expense on a 82 Table of Contents straight-line basis over the substantive vesting period. The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the companys common stock on the date of grant.
The following table summarizes nonvested RSU activity for the year ended December31, 2013.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs in 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $70.09, $57.03 and $53.87, respectively. The fair value of RSUs vested in 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $47million, $21 million and $7 million, respectively.
PSUs As part of an overall periodic evaluation of the companys stock compensation programs, the company changed the vesting condition for 50% of the PSUs granted to senior management beginning with its 2013 annual equity awards. The vesting condition for the new PSUs is based on return on invested capital, with annual performance targets set at the beginning of the year for each tranche of the award during the three-year service period. The holder of the new PSUs is entitled to receive a number of shares of common stock equal to a percentage, ranging from 0% to 200%, of the PSUs granted, depending on the actual results compared to the annual performance targets.
Compensation cost for the new PSUs is measured based on the fair value of the awards on the date that the specific vesting terms for each tranche of the award are established. The fair value of the awards is determined based on the quoted price of the companys stock on the grant date for each tranche of the award. The compensation cost for these PSUs is adjusted at each reporting date to reflect the estimated probability of achieving the vesting condition. The probability of achieving the vesting condition has not materially changed during the year ended December31, 2013.
The remaining 50% of the PSUs continue to include conditions for vesting based on Baxter stock performance relative to the companys peer group, similar to previous years, whereby a holder of these PSUs is entitled to receive a number of shares of common stock equal to a percentage, ranging from 0% to 200%, of these PSUs granted. The grant-date fair value, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the substantive vesting period.
The fair value of the remaining PSUs continues to be determined using a Monte Carlo model. A Monte Carlo model uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the market conditions and the resulting fair value of the award. The assumptions used in estimating the fair value of these PSUs granted during the period, along with the grant-date fair values, were as follows.

The employee purchase price is 85% of the closing market price on the purchase date.
In 2011, shareholders approved the Baxter International Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan which reflected the merger of the previous plans for U.S. and international employees. This employee stock purchase plan provides for 10million shares of common stock available for issuance to eligible participants.
During 2013, 2012 and 2011, the company issued approximately 0.8million, 0.9million and 0.9million shares, respectively, under the prior and current employee stock purchase plans. The number of shares under subscription at December31, 2013 totaled approximately 1.0 million.
Realized Excess Income Tax Benefits and the Impact on the Statement of Cash Flows Realized excess tax benefits associated with stock compensation are presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows as an outflow within the operating section and an inflow within the financing section. Realized excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation were $34 million, $24 million and $21 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Cash Dividends Total cash dividends declared per common share for 2013, 2012, and 2011 were $1.920, $1.570, and $1.265, respectively. In November 2013, the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.49 per share ($1.96 per share on an annualized basis), which was paid on January3, 2014 to shareholders of record as of December6, 2013.
In May 2013, the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.49 per share ($1.96 per share on an annualized basis), which represented an increase of 9% over the previous quarterly rate. In July 2012, the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share ($1.80 per share on an annualized basis), which represented an increase of 34% over the previous quarterly rate.
Stock Repurchase Programs As authorized by the board of directors, the company repurchases its stock depending on the companys cash flows, net debt level and market conditions. The company repurchased 13million shares for $0.9 billion in 2013, 25million shares for $1.5 billion in 2012, and 30million shares for $1.6 billion in 2011. In July 2012, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of the companys common stock and $1.0 billion remained available as of December31, 2013.
84 Table of Contents NOTE 12 RETIREMENT AND OTHER BENEFIT PROGRAMS The company sponsors a number of qualified and nonqualified pension plans for eligible employees. The company also sponsors certain unfunded contributory healthcare and life insurance benefits for substantially all domestic retired employees. Newly hired employees in the United States and Puerto Rico are not eligible to participate in the pension plans but receive a higher level of company contributions in the defined contribution plans. In September 2013, Baxter completed its acquisition of Gambro and assumed a net pension liability of approximately $212 million from Gambro-related pension plans, of which $209 million has been classified as a noncurrent liability. The Gambro pension plans were recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and were re-measured at year-end as part of the companys annual re-measurement of pension plan obligations and plan assets.
On August31, 2012, Baxter announced an offer to terminated-vested participants in the U.S. pension plan (approximately 16,000 participants) to pay a lump-sum payment which would fully settle the companys pension plan obligation to these participants. The company offered the one-time voluntary lump-sum payment in an effort to reduce its long-term pension obligations and ongoing annual pension expense. The final acceptance rate by participants was approximately 50 percent, which resulted in a final payout of $377 million from plan assets in December 2012. The company recorded a non-cash settlement charge of $164 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 to immediately expense the unrealized actuarial losses related to the obligations that were settled, which were previously deferred in AOCI. The settlement charge was recognized in marketing and administrative expenses since the terminated-vested participants subject to the settlement were no longer contributing to the activities of the company.

The PBO incorporates assumptions relating to future compensation levels. The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is the same as the PBO except that it includes no assumptions relating to future compensation levels. The ABO for all of the companys pension plans was $5.00 billion and $4.95 billion at the 2013 and 2012 measurement dates, respectively.
The information in the funded status table above represents the totals for all of the companys pension plans. The following is information relating to the individual plans in the funded status table above that have an ABO in excess of plan assets.

The total expected OPEB benefit payments for the next ten years are net of approximately $49 million of expected federal subsidies relating to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act, including $3 million, $4 million, $4 million, $4 million and $5 million in each of the years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.
Amounts Recognized in AOCI The pension and OPEB plans gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition assets or obligations not yet recognized in net periodic benefit cost are recognized on a net-of-tax basis in AOCI and will be amortized from AOCI to net periodic benefit cost in the future.
The following is a summary of the pre-tax losses included in AOCI at December31, 2013 and December31, 2012.

The impact of the settlement on AOCI was more than offset by the prior year actuarial losses. In 2013, the OCI activity for pension and OPEB plans related almost entirely to actuarial losses. Activity relating to prior service costs and credits and transition obligations was insignificant.
Amounts Expected to be Amortized From AOCI to Net Periodic Benefit Cost in 2014 With respect to the AOCI balance at December31, 2013, the following is a summary of the pre-tax amounts expected to be amortized to net periodic benefit cost in 2014.

The investment committee, which meets at least quarterly, abides by documented policies and procedures relating to investment goals, targeted asset 89 Table of Contents allocations, risk management practices, allowable and prohibited investment holdings, diversification, use of derivatives, the relationship between plan assets and benefit obligations, and other relevant factors and considerations.
The investment committees documented policies and procedures include the following:  Ability to pay all benefits when due;  Targeted long-term performance expectations relative to applicable market indices, such as Standard& Poors, Russell, MSCI EAFE, and other indices;  Targeted asset allocation percentage ranges (summarized below), and periodic reviews of these allocations;  Diversification of assets among third-party investment managers, and by geography, industry, stage of business cycle and other measures;  Specified investment holding and transaction prohibitions (for example, private placements or other restricted securities, securities that are not traded in a sufficiently active market, short sales, certain derivatives, commodities and margin transactions);  Specified portfolio percentage limits on holdings in a single corporate or other entity (generally 5%, except for holdings in U.S. government or agency securities);  Specified average credit quality for the fixed-income securities portfolio (at least A- by Standard& Poors or A3 by Moodys);  Specified portfolio percentage limits on foreign holdings; and  Periodic monitoring of investment manager performance and adherence to the investment committees policies.
Plan assets are invested using a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equity securities, debt securities and other investments are used to preserve asset values, diversify risk and exceed the planned benchmark investment return. Investment strategies and asset allocations are based on consideration of plan liabilities, the plans funded status and other factors, such as the plans demographics and liability durations. Investment performance is reviewed by the investment committee on a quarterly basis and asset allocations are reviewed at least annually.
Plan assets are managed in a balanced portfolio comprised of two major components:equity securities and fixed income securities. The target allocations for plan assets are 60 percent in equity securities and 40 percent in fixed income securities and other holdings. The documented policy includes an allocation range based on each individual investment type within the major components that allows for a variance from the target allocations of approximately 5 percentage points. Equity securities primarily include common stock of U.S. and international companies, common/collective trust funds, mutual funds, and partnership investments. Fixed income securities and other holdings primarily include cash, money market funds with an original maturity of three months or less, U.S. and foreign government and governmental agency issues, corporate bonds, municipal securities, hedge funds, derivative contracts and asset-backed securities.
While the investment committee provides oversight over plan assets for U.S. and international plans, the summary above is specific to the plans in the United States. The plan assets for international plans are managed and allocated by the entities in each country, with input and oversight provided by the investment committee. The plan assets for the U.S. and international plans are included in the table below.

Volatility in the global financial markets could have an unfavorable impact on future funding requirements. The company has no obligation to fund its principal plans in the United States in 2014. The company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions. The company expects to make cash contributions to its pension plans of at least $42 million in 2014, primarily related to the companys international plans. The company expects to have net cash outflows relating to its OPEB plan of approximately $25 million in 2014.
The table below details the funded status percentage of the companys pension plans as of December31, 2013, including certain plans that are unfunded in accordance with the guidelines of the companys funding policy outlined above.

Of these foreign amounts, $8 million expires in 2014, $4 million expires in 2015, $31 million expires in 2016, $49 million expires in 2017, $37 million expires in 2018, $2 million expires in 2019, $100 million expires 95 Table of Contents after 2019 and $1.1 billion has no expiration date. Realization of these operating loss and tax credit carryforwards depends on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods. A valuation allowance of $137 million and $104 million was recorded at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, to reduce the deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, because the company does not believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be fully realized prior to expiration. The company will continue to evaluate the need for additional valuation allowances and, as circumstances change, the valuation allowance may change.
Income Tax Expense Reconciliation years ended December31 (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Income tax expense at U.S. statutory rate $ 892 $ 1,011 $ 983 Tax incentives (240 ) (277 ) (360 ) State and local taxes 22 (11 ) 25 Foreign tax benefit (122 ) (177 ) (118 ) Contingent tax matters 26 30 39 Other factors (41 ) (13 ) (16 ) Income tax expense $ 537 $ 563 $ 553 The company recognized deferred US income tax expense of $47 million during 2013 relating to 2013 earnings outside the United States that are not deemed indefinitely reinvested. The company continues to evaluate whether to indefinitely reinvest earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions as it continues to analyze the companys global financial structure. Currently, management intends to continue to reinvest past earnings in several jurisdictions outside of the United States indefinitely, particularly due to the companys acquisition of Gambro which used substantial foreign cash, and therefore has not recognized U.S. income tax expense on these earnings. U.S. federal and state income taxes, net of applicable credits, on these foreign unremitted earnings of $12.2 billion as of December31, 2013 would be approximately $3.8 billion. As of December31, 2012 the foreign unremitted earnings and U.S. federal and state income tax amounts were $10.6 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively.
Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rate was 21% in 2013 and 20% in both 2012 and 2011. As detailed in the income tax expense reconciliation table above, the companys effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate each year due to certain operations that are subject to tax incentives, state and local taxes, and foreign taxes that are different than the U.S. federal statutory rate. In addition, the effective tax rate can be impacted each period by discrete factors and events.
Factors impacting the companys effective tax rate in 2013 included the favorable settlement of the companys bilateral Advance Pricing Agreement proceedings between the U.S. government and the government of Switzerland with respect to intellectual property, product, and service transfer pricing arrangements, which was offset by other contingent tax matters principally related to transfer pricing. Additionally, the effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by increases in valuation allowances in respect of the tax benefit from losses that the company does not believe that it is more likely than not to realize and interest expense related to the companys unrecognized tax benefits. Partially offsetting these unfavorable items were $16 million of U.S. R&D credits. Additionally, the companys effective tax rate was impacted by a change in the earnings mix from lower tax to higher tax rate jurisdictions compared to the prior year.
Factors impacting the companys effective tax rate in 2012 were gains of $53 million and $38 million for the reduction of certain contingent payment liabilities related to the prior acquisitions of Prism and ApaTech, respectively, for which there were no tax charges. Also impacting the effective tax rate was a cost of sales reduction of $37 million for an adjustment to the COLLEAGUE infusion pump reserves when the company 96 Table of Contents substantially completed the recall in the United States in 2012, for which there was no tax charge. These items were offset by a change in the earnings mix from lower tax to higher tax rate jurisdictions compared to the prior year period.
Factors impacting the companys effective tax rate in 2011 were tax benefits from the business optimization charge, the average wholesale price (AWP) litigation and historical price reporting charge, and other charges in 2011 which were incurred in jurisdictions with rates higher than the effective rate.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits The company classifies interest and penalties associated with income taxes in the income tax expense line in the consolidated statements of income. Net interest and penalties recorded during 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $1 million, $12 million and $18 million, respectively. The liability recorded at December31, 2013 and 2012 related to interest and penalties was $124 million and $103 million, respectively.
The following is a reconciliation of the companys unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.
as of and for the years ended (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Balance at beginning of the year $ 437 $ 443 $ 423 Increase associated with tax positions taken during the current year 31 25 37 Increase (decrease) associated with tax positions taken during a prior year 38 (9 ) 15 Settlements (216 ) (21 ) (18 ) Decrease associated with lapses in statutes of limitations (3 ) (1 ) (14 ) Balance at end of the year $ 287 $ 437 $ 443 Of the gross unrecognized tax benefits, $393 million and $517 million were recognized as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
None of the positions included in the liability for uncertain tax positions related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.
Tax Incentives The company has received tax incentives in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, and certain other taxing jurisdictions outside the United States. The financial impact of the reductions as compared to the statutory tax rates is indicated in the income tax expense reconciliation table above. The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rate favorably impacted earnings per diluted share by $0.44 in 2013, $0.50 in 2012 and $0.56 in 2011. The Puerto Rico grant provides that the companys manufacturing operations are and will be partially exempt from local taxes until the year 2018. The Switzerland grant provides that the companys manufacturing operations will be partially exempt from local taxes until the year 2014, at which time the tax rate will be approximately 8%. As a result of a restructuring of the companys Swiss legal entities in 2013, the effective tax rate on manufacturing operation in Switzerland will be under 1% for several years after 2013.
Examinations of Tax Returns As of December31, 2013, Baxter had ongoing audits in the United States, Germany, Austria, Italy, Turkey, and other jurisdictions. Baxter expects to reduce the amount of its liability for uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months by $75 million due principally to the resolution of tax disputes in Sweden and Turkey. While the final outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain, the company believes it has made adequate tax provisions for all years subject to examination.
97 Table of Contents NOTE 15 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Baxter is involved in product liability, patent, commercial, and other legal matters that arise in the normal course of the companys business. The company records a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. If a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no liability is recorded. As of December31, 2013, the companys total recorded reserves with respect to legal matters were $160 million and the total related receivables were $7 million.
Baxter has established reserves for certain of the matters discussed below. The company is not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for certain contingencies for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved. While the liability of the company in connection with the claims cannot be estimated with any certainty and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the companys results of operations and cash flows for that period, the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial position. While the company believes that it has valid defenses in these matters, litigation is inherently uncertain, excessive verdicts do occur, and the company may incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of claims.
In addition to the matters described below, the company remains subject to other potential administrative and legal actions. With respect to governmental and regulatory matters, these actions may lead to product recalls, injunctions, and other restrictions on the companys operations and monetary sanctions, including significant civil or criminal penalties. With respect to intellectual property, the company may be exposed to significant litigation concerning the scope of the companys and others rights. Such litigation could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of operations.
General litigation Baxter is a defendant in a number of suits alleging that certain of the companys current and former executive officers and its board of directors failed to adequately oversee the operations of the company and issued materially false and misleading statements regarding the companys plasma-based therapies business, the companys remediation of its COLLEAGUE infusion pumps, its heparin product, and other quality issues. Plaintiffs allege these actions damaged the company and its shareholders by resulting in a decline in stock price in the second quarter of 2010, payment of excess compensation to the board of directors and certain of the companys current and former executive officers, and other damage to the company. In August 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reinstated a consolidated derivative suit filed in the U.S.D.C. for the Northern District of Illinois that had earlier been dismissed by the district court in September 2012. In January 2014, an independent special litigation committee was established by the companys board of directors to determine whether it is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders to pursue or otherwise resolve the claims raised in and arising from this matter. Two other derivative actions have been filed in state court: one pending in the Circuit Court of Lake County, Illinois has been stayed pending the outcome of the federal action and another, in Delaware Chancery Court, that Baxter has moved to dismiss. In addition, a consolidated alleged class action is pending in the U.S.D.C. for the Northern District of Illinois against the company and certain of its current executive officers seeking to recover the lost value of investors stock and the parties are currently proceeding with discovery. In April 2013, the company filed its opposition to the plaintiffs motion to certify a class action.
The company is a defendant, along with others, in a number of lawsuits consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the U.S.D.C. for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that Baxter and certain of its competitors conspired to restrict output and artificially increase the price of plasma-derived therapies since 2003. Some of the complaints attempt to state a claim for class action relief and some cases demand treble damages. In January 2012, the court granted the companys motion to dismiss certain federal claims brought by indirect purchasers and returned the 98 Table of Contents remaining indirect purchaser claims to the court of original jurisdiction (U.S.D.C. for the Northern District of California) in August 2012. The indirect purchaser complaint was amended to remove class action allegations in May 2013. In January 2014, the company provisionally settled with the direct purchaser plaintiffs for $64 million, pending final approval of the settlement by the court which is anticipated in the first half of 2014. As of December31, 2013, the company has a litigation reserve to cover the settlement.
Product liability litigation In connection with the recall of heparin products in the United States, approximately 30 lawsuits remain pending alleging that plaintiffs suffered various reactions to a heparin contaminant, in some cases resulting in fatalities. The majority of these cases are subject to settlement agreements but remain pending while settlement documentation is being completed.
Other The company was the recipient of an inquiry from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the SEC that was part of a broader review of industry practices for compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In January 2014, the company was notified by both the DOJ and the SEC that their respective investigations were closed as to Baxter without any further action taken by either agency.
In the fourth quarter of 2012, the company received two investigative demands from the United States Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina for information regarding its quality and manufacturing practices and procedures at its North Cove facility. The company is fully cooperating with this investigation.
NOTE 16 SEGMENT INFORMATION Baxters two segments, BioScience and Medical Products, are strategic businesses that are managed separately because each business develops, manufactures and markets distinct products and services. The segments and a description of their products and services are as follows: The BioScience business processes recombinant and plasma-based proteins to treat hemophilia and other bleeding disorders; plasma-based therapies to treat immune deficiencies, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, burns and shock, and other chronic and acute blood-related conditions; biosurgery products; and select vaccines.
The Medical Products business manufactures intravenous (IV)solutions and administration sets, premixed drugs and drug-reconstitution systems, pre-filled vials and syringes for injectable drugs, IV nutrition products, infusion pumps, and inhalation anesthetics. The business also provides products and services related to pharmacy compounding, drug formulation and packaging technologies. Baxter enhanced its leadership in renal therapies with the acquisition of Gambro and now offers a comprehensive portfolio to meet the needs of patients across the treatment continuum. The portfolio includes innovative technologies and therapies for peritoneal dialysis (PD), in-center hemodialysis (HD), home hemodialysis (HHD), continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and additional dialysis services.
Also included in the Medical Products business are revenues and costs related to the manufacturing, distribution and other transition agreements with Fenwal Inc. associated with the 2007 divestiture of the Transfusion Therapies business. Post-divestiture revenues associated with these transition agreements had been reported at the corporate level (Corporate) and not allocated to a segment prior to January1, 2012. The prior period segment presentation has been recast to conform to the current period presentation.
The company uses more than one measurement and multiple views of data to measure segment performance and to allocate resources to the segments. However, the dominant measurements are consistent with the companys consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, are reported on the same basis in this report. The company 99 Table of Contents evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources to them primarily based on pre-tax income along with cash flows and overall economic returns. Intersegment sales are generally accounted for at amounts comparable to sales to unaffiliated customers, and are eliminated in consolidation. The accounting policies of the segments are substantially the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note1.
Effective in 2012, the segment measures of total assets and capital expenditures reflect a re-allocation of certain assets between segments to reflect managements use of updated segment measures to allocate resources. The prior period presentation has been recast to conform to the current period presentation. The impact on the segment measures in prior periods was a shift between Medical Products and BioScience of $988 million and $25 million for total assets and capital expenditures in 2011, respectively. The company considered the impact of this re-allocation on the goodwill impairment reviews completed in prior years and there was no impact as the fair values of the companys reporting units were substantially in excess of the carrying values.
Certain items are maintained at Corporate and are not allocated to a segment. They primarily include most of the companys debt and cash and equivalents and related net interest expense, certain foreign exchange fluctuations (principally relating to intercompany receivables, payables and loans denominated in a foreign currency) and the majority of the foreign currency hedging activities, corporate headquarters costs, stock compensation expense, certain non-strategic investments and related income and expense, certain employee benefit plan costs (including the 2012 pension settlement charges), certain nonrecurring gains and losses, certain other charges (such as business optimization, AWP litigation and historical price reporting, and asset impairment), contributions to the Baxter International Foundation, deferred income taxes, and certain litigation liabilities and related receivables. With respect to depreciation and amortization and expenditures for long-lived assets, the difference between the segment totals and the consolidated totals principally relate to assets maintained at Corporate.

103 Table of Contents Managements Responsibility for Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements and related information appearing in this report. Management believes that the consolidated financial statements fairly reflect the form and substance of transactions and that the financial statements reasonably present the companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management has also included in the companys consolidated financial statements amounts that are based on estimates and judgments, which it believes are reasonable under the circumstances.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the companys consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and provides an opinion on whether the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the company.
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the principal executive and financial officers, and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013. In making this assessment, management used the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992) , management concluded that the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2013.
Management has excluded Gambro AB (Gambro), and its holding company Indap Holding AB (Indap Holding), from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013 because we acquired Gambro in September 2013. Indap Holding and Gambro are wholly owned subsidiaries of Baxter International Inc. whose total assets and total revenues represent approximately 18% and 3%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December31, 2013.
The effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer /s/ ROBERT J. HOMBACH Robert J. Hombach Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 104 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Baxter International Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Baxter International Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting incorporated by reference under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As described in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Gambro AB (Gambro), and its holding company, Indap Holding AB (Indap Holding), from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 because Gambro and Indap Holding were acquired by the company in a purchase business combination on September 6, 2013. We have also excluded Indap Holding and Gambro from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Indap Holding and Gambro are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues represent approximately 18% and 3%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Item9A.
Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Baxter carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its Disclosure Committee and management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of Baxters disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December31, 2013. Baxters disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Baxter in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis and that such information is communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and its board of directors, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Based on that evaluation the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December31, 2013.
Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Baxters report of managements assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013 and the audit report regarding the same of Baxters independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, are included in this Annual Report on Form10-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting In the second quarter of 2010, the company began the implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system. In addition, the company is consolidating and outsourcing certain computer operations and application support activities. These multi-year initiatives will be conducted in phases and include modifications to the design and operation of controls over financial reporting. The company is testing internal controls over financial reporting for design effectiveness prior to implementation of each phase, and has monitoring controls in place over the implementation of these changes. Except for the change noted below, there have been no other changes in Baxters internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December31, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Baxters internal control over financial reporting.
In September 2013, Baxter acquired 100 percent of the voting equity interest in Indap Holding AB, the holding company for Gambro AB (Gambro). As part of the post-closing integration, the company is engaged in refining and harmonizing the internal controls and processes of the acquired business with those of the company. Management has excluded the internal controls of Gambro from its annual assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting for 2013. This exclusion is in accordance with the general guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission that an assessment of a recent business combination may be omitted from managements report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of consolidation.
