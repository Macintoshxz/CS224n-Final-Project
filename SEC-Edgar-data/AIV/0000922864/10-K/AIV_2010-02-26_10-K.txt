PART I ITEM 1.
Business Apartment Investment and Management Company, or AIMCO, is a Maryland corporation incorporated on January10, 1994. We are a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, engaged in the acquisition, ownership, management and redevelopment of apartment properties. As of December31, 2002, we owned or managed a portfolio of 1,788 apartment properties (individually a "property" and collectively the "properties") containing 318,152 apartment units located in 47 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Based on apartment unit data compiled by the National Multi Housing Council, as of December31, 2002, we were the largest owner and operator of apartment properties in the United States. We serve approximately one million residents per year.
As of December31, 2002, we:  owned a controlling equity interest in 187,506 apartment units in 728 properties (which we refer to as "consolidated");  owned a non-controlling equity interest in 73,924 apartment units in 511 properties (which we refer to as "unconsolidated"), of which 64,937 apartment units were managed by us; and  provided services or managed, for third party owners, 56,722 apartment units in 549 properties, primarily pursuant to long-term agreements (includes 45,187 apartment units in 448 properties that are asset managed only, and not also property managed).
AIMCO is the sole general partner of, and through our wholly owned subsidiaries, AIMCO-GP,Inc. and AIMCO-LP,Inc., owns a majority interest in, AIMCO Properties, L.P., which we refer to as the AIMCO Operating Partnership. As of December31, 2002, AIMCO held an approximate 89% ownership interest in the AIMCO Operating Partnership. AIMCO conducts substantially all of its business and owns substantially all of its assets through the AIMCO Operating Partnership. Interests in the AIMCO Operating Partnership that are held by limited partners other than AIMCO are referred to as "OP Units." Holders of common OP Units may redeem such units for cash or, at AIMCO's option, AIMCO ClassA Common Stock, which we refer to as Common Stock. Except as 2 the context otherwise requires, "we," "our," "us" and the "Company" refer to AIMCO, the AIMCO Operating Partnership and AIMCO's consolidated corporate subsidiaries and consolidated real estate partnerships, collectively.
At December31, 2002, 93,769,996 shares of our Common Stock were outstanding. At December31, 2002, the AIMCO Operating Partnership had 12,061,259 common OP Units and equivalents outstanding. At December31, 2002, a combined total of 105,831,255 shares of Common Stock and OPUnits were outstanding (excluding preferred OPUnits).
Effective March3, 2003, our principal executive offices were moved to 4582 South Ulster Street Parkway, Suite 1100, Denver, Colorado 80237. Our telephone number is (303)757-8101.
We make all of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable through our website at www.aimco.com. The information contained on our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report. Our Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "AIV." 2002 Developments Casden Merger On March11, 2002, we completed the acquisition of Casden Properties,Inc., or Casden, which included the merger of Casden into the Company. We refer to this transaction as the Casden Merger. In the Casden Merger we acquired 4,975 conventional apartment units located in Southern California and 11,027 affordable apartment units located in 25 states. In that transaction, we also acquired National Partnership Investments Corp., which we refer to as NAPICO, a subsidiary of Casden, which, as general partner and/or limited partner of numerous limited partnerships, has interests in more than 400 properties with more than 41,000 apartment units. We paid approximately $1.1billion for the properties and NAPICO, which included an earnout of $15million as a result of property performance for the period ended December31, 2001. To fund this acquisition we issued 3.508million shares of Common Stock and 882,784 common OP Units (valued at $164.9million and $41.5million, respectively, based on $47 per share/unit), paid approximately $198million in cash, acquired title subject to existing mortgage indebtedness of approximately $685million, and assumed short-term indebtedness of approximately $48million. We also incurred approximately $15million in transaction costs comprised largely of professional fees, which included legal, accounting, tax and acquisition due diligence.
In connection with the Casden Merger, we borrowed $287million from Lehman Commercial PaperInc. and other participating lenders, pursuant to a term loan that we refer to as the Casden Loan, to pay the cash and transaction costs required to complete the Casden Merger. During 2002, we repaid approximately 60% of the Casden Loan principally with portions of the proceeds from our public offering of Common Stock, our offering of ClassR Cumulative Preferred Stock, property sales and other net cash flow from operations. The outstanding balance on the Casden Loan was $115million at December31, 2002. For additional information on the Casden Loan see Note10 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
In addition, as part of the Casden Merger we committed to purchase two properties currently under development, upon satisfactory completion and attainment of 60% occupancy. On November27, 2002, we closed on the purchase of The Villas at Park La Brea, a mid-rise apartment community with 250 units for approximately $55.5million. The Villas at Park La Brea is the first of three phases to be completed as part of the Park La Brea development, which is one of the two development properties we have committed to purchase. The other two phases of the Park La Brea development are scheduled to be complete sometime in 2003 and 2004. There is not yet a schedule for completion of the second of the two development properties.
New England Properties Acquisition On August29, 2002, we completed the acquisition of certain New England area apartment properties. In this acquisition, which we refer to as the New England Properties Acquisition, we acquired 11 conventional garden and mid-rise properties primarily located in the greater Boston, Massachusetts area. The 11 properties include 4,323 apartment units located on approximately 553 acres in the aggregate. The total cost of the acquisition included a purchase price of $500million for the properties, $2.5million in transaction costs and $34.2million of initial capital expenditures (of which $28million will be spent to complete a kitchen and bath program and $6.2million will be spent to address other identified property needs). We funded the acquisition through a combination of non-recourse property debt of $308.7million and $200million from our credit facility. We expect to repay the borrowings on the credit facility with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales.
3 Property Dispositions During 2002, we sold 53 conventional properties, 26 affordable properties, one commercial property and seven senior living facilities for an aggregate sales price of $551.8million. These sales resulted in net proceeds to the partnerships of $184.5million after repayment of existing debt and payment of transaction costs (net of cash in the partnerships) totaling $367.3million. Our share of the net proceeds was $137.2million and was used to repay a portion of our outstanding short-term indebtedness and for other corporate purposes. Of the total property dispositions, 44 were unconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method.
Debt Assumptions and Financings On February14, 2003, we and our lenders amended our revolving credit facility to provide for a $100million increase, at our option, in the available commitment to $500million (such commitment in excess of $400million is not available until it has been syndicated), reduce the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio from 1.60:1 to 1.50:1 through the maturity date and extend the maturity date one year to July31, 2005. Upon the effective date of the amendment, the margin on LIBOR-based loans and base rate loans was amended to a range between 2.05% to 2.65% and .55% to 1.15%, respectively, based on the fixed charge coverage ratio. For additional information on the credit facility see Note11 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
During the year ended December31, 2002, we refinanced or closed 93 mortgage loans generating $1,031.7million of total proceeds at a weighted average interest rate of 4.26%, of which $937.9million related to consolidated properties (these mortgages do not include the $308.7million in mortgage loans related to the New England Properties Acquisition that are discussed below). Each loan is non-recourse. Among the 93 loans, 81 are individually secured by one of 81 properties with no cross-collateralization, and 12 loans totaling $228.4million are cross-collateralized with certain other loans. After repayment of existing debt and payment of transaction costs totaling $832.0million, our share of the total $199.7million in net proceeds was $165.8million, which was used to repay existing short-term debt and for other corporate purposes.
In connection with the New England Properties Acquisition, we closed 11 mortgage loans generating $308.7million of long-term, fixed rate, fully amortizing notes with a weighted average interest rate of 5.69%. Each loan is non-recourse and is individually secured by one of the 11 properties, with no cross-collateralization.
In connection with our purchase of the Villas at Park La Brea, we closed a $38.0million, long-term, fixed rate, fully amortizing note with an interest rate of 6.01%. This note is non-recourse and secured by the property.
In addition, in connection with the Casden Merger, we assumed $684.7million of primarily long-term, fixed-rate, fully amortizing notes payable with a weighted average interest rate of 6.85%. Each of the notes is individually secured by one of 116 properties with no cross-collateralization.
Equity Transactions Preferred Stock In 2002, we issued $51.1million of preferred stock in two underwritten public offerings yielding approximately $50.0million of net proceeds. These transactions are summarized below: Transaction Type Date Number of Shares Total Proceeds in Millions Dividend or Distribution Rate Class R Cumulative Preferred Stock of AIMCO Public March 2002 1,000,000 $ 25.8 (1) Class R Cumulative Preferred Stock of AIMCO Public April 2002 1,000,000 25.3 (1) Gross proceeds $ 51.1 (1) Dividends on the ClassR Cumulative Preferred Stock, or ClassR Preferred Stock, are paid quarterly in an amount per share equal to $2.50 per year (equivalent to 10% per annum of the $25.00 liquidation preference).
4 Common Stock The following table summarizes our significant 2002 issuances of Common Stock: Transaction Date Number of Shares Total Value in Millions Net Issue Price per Share Casden Merger March 2002 3,508,000 $ 165 $ 47.00 Public Offering June 2002 8,000,000 369 46.17 Gross value $ 534 $ 46.43 In addition, the AIMCO Operating Partnership issued 882,784 common OP Units (valued at $41.5million, based on $47 per unit) in connection with the Casden Merger, and 331,451 OP Units (valued at $16.9million) in connection with acquisitions of limited partnership and other interests.
Acquisitions of Limited Partnership Interests From time to time, we have offered and, in the future, may offer to acquire the interests held by third party investors in certain partnerships for which we act as general partner. Any such acquisitions will require funds to pay the cash purchase price for such interests. During the year ended December31, 2002, we made separate offers to the limited partners of 323 partnerships to acquire their limited partnership interests, and purchased limited partnership interests for an aggregate of approximately $31.0million, of which $27.7million was in cash and the remainder in common OP Units. This compares to the year ended December31, 2001 when we made separate offers to the limited partners of 261 partnerships to acquire their limited partnership interests, and purchased approximately $178.0million, of which $135.6million was in cash and the remainder in common OP Units. Although the reason for this year over year decline is uncertain, we believe four primary factors contributed: improved real estate partnership results (including cash distributions to partners in recent years in increasing amounts resulting in increased returns); the relative attractiveness of investments in real estate as compared to other investment opportunities; greater sensitivity on the part of investors to tax liabilities related to such sales in the current volatile investment marketplace; and less third party equity available in affiliated partnerships as a result of our prior purchases.
Transactions Involving Notes Receivable During 2002, we completed a thorough collectibility analysis of each of our notes receivable, primarily from unconsolidated real estate partnerships. As a result of this process, we recorded a provision for loan losses of approximately $9.0million. In addition, we identified transactions (including sales, refinancings, foreclosures and rights offerings) that would provide for collection of certain notes receivable (either in cash or by obtaining title to the property or additional ownership interest in the partnership owning the property). In 2002, we executed such transactions on notes receivable with carrying values of $111.2million, and based on their fair values, recorded accretion income of approximately $36.8million.
Financial Information About Industry Segments We operate in two industry segments: the acquisition, ownership, operation and redevelopment of a diversified portfolio of properties; and providing management and other services relating to the apartment business to third parties and affiliates. For further information on these segments and other related information on the various components of our operations, see Note24 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, and Management's Discussion and Analysis in Item 7, of this Annual Report.
Operating and Financial Strategies Our principal operating objectives are to increase long-term stockholder value by increasing operating cash flows, and to provide long-term, predictable Funds From Operations, or FFO (as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts), per share of Common Stock, less capital spending for replacements and enhancements. For a description of the meaning of FFO and its use and limitation as an operating measure, see the discussion titled "Funds From Operations" in Item 7 of this Annual Report. We strive to meet our objective by implementing operating and financing strategies that include the following: 5  Acquisition of Properties at Less Than Replacement Cost.
We attempt to acquire properties at a significant discount to their replacement cost.
Geographic Diversification.
We operate in 47 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. This geographic diversification insulates us, to some degree, from inevitable downturns in any one market. Our income before depreciation and interest expense, is currently earned in more than 198 local markets. In 2002, the largest single market (Washington, D.C.) contributed approximately 12% to income before depreciation and interest expense, and the five largest markets (Washington, D.C., Chicago, greater Los Angeles, southeast Florida and Houston) together contributed approximately 32%. With the properties acquired through the New England Properties Acquisition, in the last quarter of 2002, the greater Boston market became one of our five largest markets. Although we intend to maintain broad geographic diversification, we plan to concentrate conventional operations in core markets in order to achieve economies of scale in management and operations.
Market Growth.
We seek to operate in markets where population and employment growth are expected to exceed the national average and where we believe we can become a regionally significant owner or manager of properties.
Price Point Diversification.
Our portfolio of properties covers a broad range of average monthly rental rates, with most between $500 and $1,200 per month.
Product Diversification.
Our portfolio of properties spans a wide range of apartment community types, both within and among markets, including garden and high-rise apartments. In addition to community types, we have a wide range of quality, from A to C rated properties, with our principal focus on B rated properties.
Capital Replacements and Capital Enhancements.
We believe that the physical condition and amenities of our apartment properties are important factors in our ability to maintain and increase rental rates. In 2002, we spent approximately $478 per owned apartment unit for Capital Replacements, which are expenditures required to maintain the related asset, and $46 per owned apartment unit for Capital Enhancements, which are expenditures that add a new feature or revenue source at a property.
Debt Financing.
Our strategy is generally to incur debt to increase our return on equity while maintaining acceptable interest coverage ratios. We seek to maintain a ratio of free cash flow to combined interest expense and preferred stock dividends of between 2:1 and 3:1 and to match debt maturities to the character of the assets financed. For the year ended December31, 2002, however, we had a ratio of free cash flow to combined interest expense and preferred stock dividends of 1.81:1, and this ratio in prior periods has also deviated from our goal. This ratio is below our desired minimum and primarily resulted from the difficult national economy and weaker operations. Our goal over time is to increase the coverage ratio to 2.2:1 through debt repayment from property sales, debt amortization, conversions of convertible preferred securities, redemptions of preferred securities and improved operating performance. As a comparison to our free cash flow ratio, for the year ended December31, 2002, we had a ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, to interest expense equal to 2.6:1. We predominantly use long-term, fixed-rate and self-amortizing non-recourse debt in order to avoid the refunding and repricing risks of short-term borrowings. We use short-term debt to fund short-term uses as well as acquisitions and generally expect to repay acquisition borrowings with operating earnings, property sales proceeds or long-term debt financings. As of December31, 2002, approximately 9% of our outstanding debt was short-term debt and 91% was long-term debt.
Dispositions.
Although we hold all of our properties for investment, we sell properties when they do not meet our investment criteria or are located in areas that we believe do not justify our continued investment, in both cases as compared to alternative uses for our capital. We have identified approximately 300 conventional properties comprising 75,000 apartment units that we characterize as "intermediate-term hold" properties. We intend to sell these properties over the next four years and use the proceeds to fund repayment of short-term debt, improvements to "long-term hold" properties, acquisitions of properties and limited partnership interests, share repurchases or redemptions of preferred securities and other corporate purposes. Approximately 440 conventional properties comprising 130,000 apartment units concentrated in 27 primary markets are what we characterize as "long-term hold" properties.
Dividend Policy.
We pay dividends to our stockholders. We distributed 70.7%, 60.7%, and 59.9% of FFO to holders of Common Stock for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. It is the present policy of our Board of Directors to increase the dividend annually in an amount equal to one-half of 6 the projected increase in Adjusted Funds From Operations, or AFFO (which is FFO adjusted for Capital Replacement and Capital Enhancement spending), subject to minimum distribution requirements to maintain our REIT status. Beginning with the year ended December31, 2002, AFFO includes a deduction for Capital Enhancements, a discretionary spending item, as well as a deduction for Capital Replacements. Our Board of Directors considers the discretionary nature of Capital Enhancement spending in its consideration of AFFO as it relates to our dividend policy. The dividend paid in February2003 of $0.82 per share, which was the same dividend amount as was paid in each quarter of 2002, represents a distribution of 96% of AFFO (before deducting Capital Enhancements) and 78% of FFO for the quarter ended December31, 2002. We continue to monitor the dividend as a percentage of AFFO (before deducting Capital Enhancements). If the payout were to exceed 100% for a sustained period, our Board of Directors would consider a change in the dividend to match our operating profitability.
Growth Strategies We seek growth through four primary sources  property operations, affordable activities, redevelopment of properties and acquisitions.
Property Operations We pursue operational growth primarily through the following strategies:  Revenue Increases.
We increase rents where feasible and seek to improve occupancy rates. We are also focused on the automation of on-site operations, as we believe that timely and accurate collection of property performance and resident profile data will enable us to maximize revenue through better property management and leasing decisions. In addition, we intend to continue our emphasis on the quality of our on-site employees through recruiting, training and retention programs, which we believe lead to increased occupancy rates through improved customer service and enhanced performance.
Controlling Expenses.
Cost reductions are accomplished by local focus at the regional operating center level and by taking advantage of economies of scale at the corporate level. As a result of the size of our portfolio and our creation of regional concentrations of properties, we have the ability to spread over a large property base fixed costs for general and administrative expenditures and certain operating functions, such as purchasing, insurance and information technology. We are automating our supply chain to provide better control over purchasing decisions and to take advantage of volume discounts.
Ancillary Services.
We believe that our ownership and management of properties provide us with unique access to a customer base that allows us to provide additional services and thereby increase occupancy and rents, while also generating incremental revenue. We currently provide cable television, telephone services, appliance rental, and carport, garage and storage space rental at certain properties.
Resident Selection and Retention .In apartment properties, neighbors are a part of the product together with the location of the property and the physical quality of the apartment units. We have created a resident acquisition and retention department to focus efforts on attracting and retaining residents who are good neighbors and are credit worthy. We are taking a national approach to marketing to take advantage of our scale in media buying, with pricing decisions being made at the regional level.
Focus on Top Properties.
Our conventional properties are ranked by their contribution to free cash flow. We have 25 properties that contribute approximately 23% of our total free cash flow, which we characterize as our "Top 25." In these properties, management decision-making is close to the property level as 20 properties out of the Top 25 properties have community managers that report directly to a Regional Vice President.
Affordable Activities In 2002, we formed Aimco Capital to integrate our affordable property operations, asset management and transaction activities. Our primary objective with Aimco Capital is to provide a predictable and increasing free cash flow through ownership and expertise in affordable properties and transactions. In order to enhance the value of our affordable properties, we seek to identify redevelopment opportunities and increase rent levels. In addition, we manage assets and transactions generating fees to Aimco Capital.
7 Redevelopment of Properties We believe redevelopment of selected properties in superior locations provides advantages over ground-up development, enabling us to generate rents comparable to new properties with relatively lower financial risk, in less time and with reduced delays due to governmental regulation. Our current policy is to generally limit redevelopments to approximately 10% of total common and preferred equity market capitalization, which, as of December31, 2002 was approximately $5.0billion. As of December31, 2002, we had 10 properties with 3,678 units under redevelopment having an estimated total investment (fair market value prior to redevelopment plus new redevelopment spending) of $601million, of which approximately $34million remains to be spent. Our share of the estimated total investment is $501million of which approximately $21million remains to be spent.
Acquisitions We believe our acquisition strategies may increase profitability and predictability of earnings by expanding operations in select markets, gaining economies of scale and increasing opportunities to provide ancillary services to residents at acquired properties. We acquire additional properties primarily in three ways:  Direct Acquisitions.
We may directly, including through mergers and other business combinations, acquire individual apartment properties or portfolios of apartment properties and controlling interests in entities that own or control such properties or portfolios. To date, a significant portion of our growth has resulted from the acquisition of other companies that owned or controlled apartment properties.
Increasing our Interest in Partnerships.
For properties where we own a general partnership interest in the property-owning partnership, we may seek to acquire, subject to our fiduciary duties, the interests in the partnership held by third parties for cash or, in some cases, in exchange for OP Units. Since 1996, we have completed over 2,500 tender offers with respect to various partnerships resulting in over 160,000 transactions totaling $826million in cash and OP Units spent to purchase additional interests in such partnerships.
Acquisition of Managed Properties.
Our property management operations have contributed to our acquisition activities. Since our initial public offering, we have acquired from our managed portfolio 16 properties comprising 5,697 apartment units for total consideration of $189.9million. In addition, in September2000, we acquired interests in 167 Oxford properties comprising 36,949 apartment units, which we had managed for a number of years previously, for a total purchase price of approximately $1.2billion.
Property Management Strategies We seek to improve the operating results from our property management operations by, among other methods, combining centralized financial control and uniform operating procedures with localized property management decision-making and market knowledge. Currently, our property management operations are organized by our two major business components of conventional and affordable. Our conventional management operations are organized into 15 regional operating centers, each of which is supervised by a Regional Vice-President. As discussed previously, we formed Aimco Capital to integrate our affordable property operations, asset management and transaction activities. Within Aimco Capital, the affordable management operations are organized into four regional operating centers, each of which is supervised by a Regional Vice-President.
Our Taxation We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December31, 1994, and intend to continue to operate in such a manner. Our current and continuing qualification as a REIT depends on our ability to meet the various requirements imposed by the Code, through actual operating results, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership.
If we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will generally not be subject to United States Federal corporate income tax on our net income that is currently distributed to stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the "double taxation" (at the corporate and stockholder levels) that generally results from investment in a corporation. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, our taxable income will be subject to United States Federal income tax at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax). Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local income taxes and to United States Federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
8 If in any taxable year we fail to qualify as a REIT and incur additional tax liability, we may need to borrow funds or liquidate certain investments in order to pay the applicable tax and we would not be compelled to make distributions under the Code. Unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost. Although we currently intend to operate in a manner designed to qualify as a REIT, it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT or may cause our Board of Directors to revoke the REIT election.
We and our stockholders may be subject to state or local taxation in various state or local jurisdictions, including those in which we or they transact business or reside. The state and local tax treatment that we and our stockholders receive may not conform to the United States Federal income tax treatment.
Certain of our operations (property management, asset management, risk, etc.) are conducted through Taxable REIT Subsidiaries, each of which we refer to as a TRS. A TRS is a C-corporation that has not elected REIT status and as such is subject to United States Federal corporate income tax. We use the TRS format to facilitate our ability to offer certain services and activities to our residents that are not generally considered as qualifying REIT activities.
Competition In attracting and retaining residents we compete with numerous other housing alternatives. Our properties compete directly with other rental apartments and with single family homes that are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located. Our properties also compete for residents with new and existing condominiums. The number of competitive properties in a particular area has a material effect on our ability to lease apartment units at our properties and on the rents we charge. We compete with numerous real estate companies in acquiring, developing and managing apartment properties and in seeking residents to occupy our properties.
Regulation General Apartment properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to recreational facilities such as swimming pools, activity centers and other common areas. Changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions, as well as changes in laws affecting development, construction and safety requirements, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely affect our cash flows from operating activities. In addition, future enactment of rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing may reduce rental revenue or increase operating costs in particular markets.
Environmental Various Federal, state and local laws subject property owners and operators to liability for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances present on a property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of the hazardous substances. The presence of, or the failure to remedy properly, hazardous substances may adversely affect both occupancy at affected apartment communities and also the ability to sell or finance the affected properties. In addition to the costs associated with investigation and remediation actions brought by governmental agencies, the presence of hazardous wastes on a property could result in claims by private plaintiffs for personal injury, disease, disability or other infirmities. Various laws also impose liability for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at the disposal or treatment facility. Anyone who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances is potentially liable under such laws. These laws often impose liability whether or not the person arranging for the disposal ever owned or operated the disposal facility. In connection with the ownership, operation and management of properties, we could potentially be liable for environmental liabilities or costs associated with our properties or properties we acquire or manage in the future.
There have been recent reports of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties asserting claims of personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential units. Some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. We have been named as a defendant in lawsuits that have alleged personal injury as a result of the presence of mold. Prior to March31, 2002, we generally 9 were insured against claims arising from the presence of mold due to water intrusion. However, since March31, 2002, our insurance coverage for property damage loss claims arising from the presence of mold has become more limited and generally includes only limited coverage for catastrophic property damage due to mold. In addition, since December31, 2002, our insurance coverage for personal injury claims related to mold exposure has also become more limited.
We have implemented protocols and procedures to prevent or eliminate mold from our properties and believe that our measures will reduce, or even minimize, the effects that mold could have on our residents. To date, we have not incurred any material costs or liabilities relating to claims of mold exposure or to abatement of mold conditions. However, because the law regarding mold is unsettled and subject to change we can make no assurance that future liabilities resulting from the presence of, or exposure to, mold will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.
Affordable Housing As of December31, 2002, we owned a controlling equity interest in 137 properties, held a non-controlling equity interest in 383 properties and managed for third parties and affiliates 523 properties that benefit from governmental programs intended to provide housing to people with low or moderate incomes. These programs, which are usually administered by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, or state housing finance agencies, typically provide mortgage insurance, favorable financing terms, tax credits or rental assistance payments to the property owners. As a condition of the receipt of assistance under these programs, the properties must comply with various requirements, which typically limit rents to pre-approved amounts. If permitted rents on a property are insufficient to cover costs, a sale of the property may become necessary, which could result in a loss of management fee revenue. We usually need to obtain the approval of HUD in order to manage, or acquire a significant interest in, a HUD-assisted property. We may not always receive such approval.
Laws benefiting disabled persons Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or ADA, all places intended to be used by the public are required to meet certain Federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Likewise, the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, or FHAA, requires apartment properties first occupied after March13, 1990 to be accessible to the handicapped. These and other Federal, state and local laws may require modifications to our properties, or restrict renovations of the properties. Noncompliance with these laws could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any non-complying feature, which could result in substantial capital expenditures. Although we believe that our properties are substantially in compliance with present requirements, we may incur unanticipated expenses to comply with the ADA and the FHAA.
Insurance We believe that our insurance coverages insure our properties adequately against the risk of loss attributable to fire, earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood and other perils. AIMCO AssuranceLtd., a Bermuda domiciled insurer wholly owned by us, has a reinsurance contract with a third party insurer to cover 100% of the first $1million loss from any casualty related to the conventional properties. The affordable properties are insured for the first $1million through an independent third party carrier. For the policy year ending February28, 2003, we were insured for any casualty loss in excess of $1million, up to $230million, by a combination of several "excess" insurance providers, all of which were at least A-rated. For the policy year ending February28, 2003, we also have retained an annual aggregate exposure of $4million above the first $1million per occurrence. As a result of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, we are currently evaluating the price of offers, mandated by the legislation, to purchase terrorism insurance.
In addition, we have self-insured retentions in workers' compensation and general liability coverage. In workers' compensation, we retain the first $500,000 per incident. We perform regular analyses to ensure adequate reserves for losses. Recent insurance marketplace conditions led to a dramatic increase in general liability insurance premiums. To mitigate proposed increases, we chose to take a self-insured retention. Effective December31, 2002, AIMCO AssuranceLtd., reinsures 100% of the risk of the first $250,000 of any general liability loss. We have established loss prevention, loss mitigation, claim handling, litigation management, and loss reserving procedures to manage our exposure. Where appropriate, in order to comply with HUD regulations, we separate segments of our properties into different insurance programs.
10 We believe that our ability to manage successfully these retentions creates a competitive cost advantage relative to other smaller competitors; however the realization of this potential advantage depends upon the skill with which we manage this risk.
Employees We currently have approximately 7,500 employees, of which approximately 6,500 are at the property level, performing various on-site functions. The balance of our employees manage corporate and regional operations, including investment transactions, legal, financial reporting, accounting, information systems, human resources and other support functions. Fewer than 200 of our employees are represented by unions. We have never experienced a work stoppage and believe we maintain satisfactory relations with our employees.
Risk Factors The risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this Annual Report, describe certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.
If we are not able successfully to acquire, operate, redevelop and expand properties, our growth and results of operations will be adversely affected.
The selective acquisition, redevelopment and expansion of properties is one component of our growth strategy. However, we may not be able to complete successfully transactions in the future. Although we seek to acquire, operate, develop and expand properties only when such activities increase our net income on a per share basis, such transactions may fail to perform in accordance with our expectations. When we develop or expand properties, we are subject to the risks that:  costs may exceed original estimates;  occupancy and rental rates at the property may be below our projections;  financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all;  redevelopment and leasing of the properties may not be completed on schedule; and  we may experience difficulty or delays in obtaining necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations.
We may have difficulty integrating any acquired businesses or properties.
We have grown rapidly. Since our initial public offering in July1994, we have completed numerous acquisition transactions, expanding our portfolio of owned or managed properties from 132 properties with 29,343 apartment units to 1,788 properties with 318,152 apartment units as of December31, 2002. These acquisitions have included purchases of properties and interests in entities that own or manage properties, as well as corporate mergers. Our ability to integrate successfully acquired businesses and properties depends, among other things, on our ability to:  attract and retain qualified personnel;  integrate the personnel and operations of the acquired businesses;  maintain standards, controls, procedures and policies; and  maintain adequate accounting and information systems.
We can provide no assurance that we will be able to accomplish these goals and successfully integrate any acquired businesses or properties. If we fail to integrate successfully such businesses, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
As our size increases, it becomes more difficult for us to achieve a comparably rapid rate of growth in assets.
Our rapid growth since our initial public offering in July1994 was achieved when we were a smaller company. As a result of our current size, future acquisitions of the same size and magnitude will likely have a smaller effect on us. It may also be more difficult for us to identify and complete acquisitions of greater size that are consistent with our growth strategy.
We are subject to litigation associated with partnership acquisitions that could increase our expenses and prevent completion of beneficial transactions.
11 We have engaged in, and intend to continue to engage in, the selective acquisition of interests in limited partnerships that own apartment properties. In some cases, we have acquired the general partner of a partnership and then made an offer to acquire the limited partners' interests in the partnership. In these transactions, we may be subject to litigation based on claims that we, as the general partner, have breached our fiduciary duty to our limited partners or that the transaction violates the relevant partnership agreement or state law. Although we intend to comply with our fiduciary obligations and the relevant partnership agreements, we may incur additional costs in connection with the defense or settlement of this type of litigation. In some cases, this type of litigation may adversely affect our desire to proceed with, or our ability to complete, a particular transaction. Any litigation of this type could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
Our existing and future debt financing could render us unable to operate, result in foreclosure on our properties or prevent us from making distributions on our equity.
Our strategy is generally to incur debt to increase the return on our equity while maintaining acceptable interest coverage ratios. We seek to maintain a ratio of free cash flow to combined interest expense and preferred stock dividends of between 2:1 and 3:1 and to match debt maturities to the character of the assets financed. For the year ended December31, 2002, however, we had a ratio of free cash flow to combined interest expense and preferred stock dividends of 1.81:1, and this ratio in prior periods has also deviated from our goal. As a comparison to our free cash flow ratio, for the year ended December31, 2002, we had a ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, to interest expense equal to 2.6:1. In addition, our Board of Directors could change this strategy at any time and increase our leverage. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur, and we have significant amounts of debt outstanding. Payments of principal and interest may leave us with insufficient cash resources to operate our properties or pay distributions required to be paid in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT. We are also subject to the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, and the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. If we fail to make required payments of principal and interest on any debt, our lenders could foreclose on the properties securing such debt that would result in loss of income and asset value to us. As of December31, 2002, substantially all of the properties that we owned or controlled were encumbered by debt. As of December31, 2002, we had $6.2billion of indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis, approximately 93% of which was secured by our properties.
Increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense.
As of December31, 2002, approximately $1,411.2million of our debt (22.6% of total debt outstanding) was subject to variable interest rates. Of the total debt subject to variable interest rates, the major components were floating rate tax-exempt bond financing ($786.2million), floating rate secured notes ($219.0million), the Casden Loan ($115.0million) and our credit facility ($291.0million). Based on this level of debt, an increase in interest rates of 1% would result in our income and cash flows being reduced by $14.1million on an annual basis and could impair our ability to service our indebtedness and make dividends or other distributions. Historically, changes in tax-exempt interest rates have been at a ratio less than 1:1 with changes in taxable interest rates. Variable rate tax-exempt bond financing is benchmarked against the Bond Market Association Municipal Swap Index (the "BMA Index"). Since 1981, the BMA Index has averaged 54.2% of the 10-year Treasury Yield. If this relationship continues and based on our level of tax-exempt debt, an increase of 1% in taxable interest rates would result in our income and cash flows being reduced by $10.5million on an annual basis.
Covenant restrictions may limit our ability to make payments to our investors.
Some of our debt and other securities contain covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied. Our credit facilities provide that we may make distributions to our investors during any 12-month period in an aggregate amount that does not exceed the greater of 80% of our Funds From Operations for such period or such amount as may be necessary to maintain our REIT status. Pursuant to the amendment of our credit facilities, effective February2003, the credit facilities prohibit all distributions if our:  fixed charge coverage ratio (excluding scheduled amortization of the Casden Loan) is less than 1.50 to 1 through July31, 2005;  adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio (including scheduled amortization of the Casden Loan) is less than 1.45 to 1;  interest coverage ratio is less than 2.25 to 1;  unsecured debt service coverage ratio is less than 3.00 to 1; 12  total combined debt to gross asset value ratio exceeds 0.55 to 1;  total obligations to gross asset value ratio exceeds 0.65 to 1;  encumbered property debt coverage ratio is less than 1.60 to 1; or  consolidated net worth is less than the sum of $3.2billion and 85% of the net proceeds of any securities issuances after September30, 2002.
Our outstanding classes of preferred stock prohibit the payment of dividends on our Common Stock if we fail to pay the dividends to which the holders of the preferred stock are entitled. In addition, our 6 1 / 2 % convertible debentures prohibit the payment of dividends on our capital stock if we elect to defer payments of interest on these convertible debentures, which we may have the right to do for up to 60months. If we are unable to pay dividends, we may fail to qualify as a REIT. This would subject us to corporate taxation and reduce our ability to make distributions to our investors.
We depend on distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries that they may be prohibited from making to us.
All of our properties are owned, and all of our operations are conducted, by the AIMCO Operating Partnership and our other subsidiaries. As a result, we depend on distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries in order to satisfy our financial obligations and make payments to our investors. The ability of our subsidiaries to make such distributions and other payments depends on their earnings and may be subject to statutory or contractual limitations. As an equity investor in our subsidiaries, our right to receive assets upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of their creditors. To the extent that we are recognized as a creditor of such subsidiaries, our claims may still be subordinate to any security interest in or other lien on their assets and to any of their debt or other obligations that are senior to our claims.
Changes in the real estate market may limit our ability to generate Funds From Operations.
Our ability to make payments to our investors depends on our ability to generate Funds From Operations in excess of required debt payments and capital expenditure requirements. Funds From Operations and the value of our properties may be adversely affected by events or conditions beyond our control, including:  the general economic climate;  competition from other apartment communities and other housing options;  local conditions, such as an increase in unemployment or an increase in the supply of apartments, that might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates;  changes in governmental regulations and the related cost of compliance;  increases in operating costs (including real estate taxes) due to inflation and other factors, which may not necessarily be offset by increased rents;  changes in tax laws and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing;  changes in interest rates and the availability of financing; and  the relative illiquidity of real estate investments.
Laws benefiting disabled persons may result in our incurrence of unanticipated expenses.
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or ADA, all places intended to be used by the public are required to meet certain Federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Likewise, the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, or FHAA, requires apartment properties first occupied after March13, 1990 to be accessible to the handicapped. These and other Federal, state and local laws may require modifications to our properties, or restrict renovations of the properties. Noncompliance with these laws could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any non-complying feature, which could result in substantial capital expenditures. Although we believe that our properties are substantially in compliance with present requirements, we may incur unanticipated expenses to comply with the ADA and the FHAA.
Affordable housing regulations may limit rent increases at some of our properties, reducing our revenue and, in some cases, causing us to sell properties that we might otherwise continue to own.
As of December31, 2002, we owned a controlling equity interest in 137 properties, held a non-controlling equity interest in 383 properties and 13 managed for third parties and affiliates 523 properties that benefit from governmental programs intended to provide housing to people with low or moderate incomes. These programs, which are usually administered by HUD or state housing finance agencies, typically provide mortgage insurance, favorable financing terms or rental assistance payments to the property owners. As a condition of the receipt of assistance under these programs, the properties must comply with various requirements, which typically limit rents to pre-approved amounts. If permitted rents on a property are insufficient to cover costs, a sale of the property may become necessary, which could result in a loss of management fee revenue. We usually need to obtain the approval of HUD in order to manage, or acquire a significant interest in, a HUD-assisted property. We may not always receive such approval.
We depend on our chief executive officer and president; our operations might be harmed if we lost their services.
Although we have entered into employment agreements with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Terry Considine, and our Vice Chairman and President, Peter K. Kompaniez, the loss of either of their services could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
We may fail to qualify as a REIT.
We believe that we operate, and have always operated, in a manner that enables us to meet the requirements for qualification as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes. Our continued qualification as a REIT will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, investment, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. Our compliance with the REIT income and quarterly asset requirements also depends upon our ability to manage successfully the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. Moreover, the proper classification of an instrument as debt or equity for Federal income tax purposes may be uncertain in some circumstances, which could affect the application of the REIT qualification requirements. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, will not contend that our interests in subsidiaries or other issuers constitutes a violation of the REIT requirements. Moreover, future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT, or our Board of Directors may determine to revoke our REIT status. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income, and we will be subject to Federal income tax at regular corporate rates, including any applicable alternative minimum tax. This would substantially reduce our funds available for payment to our investors. Unless entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code, we would also be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a REIT.
In addition, our failure to qualify as a REIT would trigger the following consequences:  we would be obligated to repurchase a material amount of our preferred stock, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the date of repurchase; and  we would be in default under our primary credit facilities and certain other loan agreements.
REIT distribution requirements limit our available cash.
As a REIT, we are subject to annual distribution requirements, which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. We generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net REIT taxable income, excluding any net capital gain, in order for corporate income tax not to apply to earnings that we distribute. We intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the requirements of the Code. However, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the Code.
Legislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on us.
The rules dealing with Federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the United States Treasury Department. Changes to the tax laws (which may have retroactive application) could adversely affect our investors. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us. For example, under legislation effective January1, 2001, if any of our management companies were deemed to operate or manage a health care or lodging facility, we would fail to qualify as a REIT. Although we believe that, since January1, 2001, none of the management companies have operated or managed any health care 14 or lodging facilities, the statute provides little guidance as to the definition of a health care or lodging facility. Accordingly, we cannot assure that the IRS will not contend that any of our management companies operate or manage a health care or lodging facility, resulting in our disqualification as a REIT. President Bush has proposed changes in the taxation of corporate dividends and gains on dispositions of corporate securities, We cannot predict whether all or any portion of the proposal will be adopted and, if adopted, the effect it would have on our share price.
We may be subject to other tax liabilities.
Even if we qualify as a REIT, we and our subsidiaries may be subject to certain Federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. Any such taxes would reduce our operating cash flow.
The FBI has issued an alert regarding potential terrorist threats involving apartment buildings  a risk for which we are partially insured.
On May6, 2002 and February 7, 2003, respectively, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Department of Homeland Security issued alerts regarding potential terrorist threats involving apartment buildings. Threats of future terrorist attacks, such as those announced by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, could have a negative effect on rent and occupancy levels at our properties. The effect that future terrorist activities or threats of such activities could have on our business cannot presently be determined. If we incur a loss at a property as a result of an act of terrorism, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in the property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. The recent enactment by the United States Congress of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, or TRIA, has resulted in terrorism coverage exclusions being invalidated, pending formal mandated notice from our carriers of terrorism coverage pricing. We are currently reviewing these quotes so as to make a determination as to whether the cost is reasonable. Prior to the enactment of TRIA, and because we have a highly diversified and geographically dispersed portfolio of residential properties, our lenders generally have not required us to purchase terrorism insurance. If in the future we decide to purchase such insurance, or if our lenders require us to purchase such insurance, the cost could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.
Insurance coverage is becoming more expensive and more difficult to obtain.
The current insurance market is characterized by rising premium rates, increasing deductibles, and more restrictive coverage language. Recent developments have resulted in significant increases in our insurance premiums and have made it more difficult to obtain certain types of insurance. As an example, many insurance carriers are excluding mold-related risks from their policy coverages, or are adding significant restrictions to such coverage. Although we make use of many alternative methods of risk financing that enable us to insulate ourselves to some degree from variation in coverage language and cost, continued deterioration in insurance market place conditions may have a negative effect on our operating results.
Limits on ownership of shares in our charter may result in the loss of economic and voting rights by purchasers that violate those limits.
Our charter limits ownership of our Common Stock by any single stockholder to 8.7% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, or 15% in the case of certain pension trusts, registered investment companies and Mr.Considine. Our charter also limits ownership of our Common Stock and preferred stock by any single stockholder to 8.7% of the value of the outstanding Common Stock and preferred stock, or 15% in the case of certain pension trusts, registered investment companies and Mr.Considine. The charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares of our capital stock if the purchase would result in us losing our REIT status. This could happen if a transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of our shares of capital stock or results in five or fewer persons, applying certain attribution rules of the Code, owning 50% or more of the value of all of our shares of capital stock. If you or anyone else acquires shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the Code for REITs:  the transfer will be considered null and void;  we will not reflect the transaction on our books;  we may institute legal action to enjoin the transaction;  we may demand repayment of any dividends received by the affected person on those shares;  we may redeem the shares; 15  the affected person will not have any voting rights for those shares; and  the shares (and all voting and dividend rights of the shares) will be held in trust for the benefit of one or more charitable organizations designated by us.
We may purchase the shares of capital stock held in trust at a price equal to the lesser of the price paid by the transferee of the shares or the then current market price. If the trust transfers any of the shares of capital stock, the affected person will receive the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the then current market price. An individual who acquires shares of capital stock that violate the above rules bears the risk that the individual:  may lose control over the power to dispose of such shares;  may not recognize profit from the sale of such shares if the market price of the shares increases;  may be required to recognize a loss from the sale of such shares if the market price decreases; and  may be required to repay to us any distributions received from us as a result of his or her ownership of the shares.
Our charter may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us.
The 8.7% ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of us by a third party without the consent of our Board of Directors. Our charter authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to 510,587,500 shares of capital stock. As of December31, 2002, 454,962,738 shares were classified as Common Stock and 55,624,762 shares were classified as preferred stock. Under the charter, our Board of Directors has the authority to classify and reclassify any of our unissued shares of capital stock into shares of capital stock with such preferences, rights, powers and restrictions as our Board of Directors may determine. The authorization and issuance of a new class of capital stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of us, even if a change in control were in our stockholders' best interests.
Maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us.
As a Maryland corporation, we are subject to various Maryland laws that may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire us and increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in our stockholders' best interests. The Maryland General Corporation Law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock representing 10% or more of the voting power without our Board of Directors' prior approval. Any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2 / 3 % of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. Maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our capital stock that represent 10% or more of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote. Additionally, Maryland law provides, among other things, that the board of directors has broad discretion in adopting stockholders' rights plans and has the sole power to fix the record date, time and place for special meetings of the stockholders. In addition, Maryland law provides that corporations that:  have at least three directors who are not employees of the entity or related to an acquiring person; and  are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, may elect in their charter or bylaws or by resolution of the board of directors to be subject to all or part of a special subtitle that provides that:  the corporation will have a staggered board of directors;  any director may be removed only for cause and by the vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors generally, even if a lesser proportion is provided in the charter or bylaws;  the number of directors may only be set by the board of directors, even if the procedure is contrary to the charter or bylaws;  vacancies may only be filled by the remaining directors, even if the procedure is contrary to the charter or bylaws; and  the secretary of the corporation may call a special meeting of stockholders at the request of stockholders only on the written request of the stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting, even if the procedure is contrary to the charter or bylaws.
To date, we have not made any of the elections described above.
16 ITEM 2.
Properties Our properties are located in 47 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Conventional property operations are headed by six Division Vice Presidents who together oversee 15 regional operating centers. Affordable property operations are managed through Aimco Capital, with one Division Vice President overseeing four regional operating centers.

These consolidated properties contain, on average, 260 apartment units, with the largest property containing 2,907 apartment units. These properties offer residents a range of amenities, including swimming pools, clubhouses, spas, fitness centers, tennis courts and saunas. Many of the apartment units offer design and appliance features such as vaulted ceilings, fireplaces, washer and dryer hook-ups, cable television, balconies and patios. Additional information on our consolidated properties is contained in "ScheduleIII, Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation" in this Annual Report. At December31, 2002, we held a non-controlling equity interest in 511 properties containing 73,924 apartment units, which we refer to as "unconsolidated." In addition, we provided services or managed for third parties 549 other properties containing 56,722 apartment units. This includes 45,187 apartment units in 448 properties that are asset-managed only, not also property managed, by us. Our total portfolio of 1,788 properties contain, on average, 201 apartment units, with the largest property containing 2,907 apartment units, and includes 47 properties with 8,987 apartment units that are not currently managed by us.
17 Substantially all of our consolidated apartment properties are encumbered by mortgage indebtedness. At December31, 2002, we had aggregate mortgage indebtedness totaling $5,827.7million, which was secured by 708 properties with a combined net book value of $8,862.3million, having an aggregate weighted average interest rate of 6.45%, not including $50.9 million of liabilities related to assets held for sale. As of December31, 2002, we had a total of 49 mortgage loans, with an aggregate principal balance outstanding of $573.4million, that were each secured by property and cross-collateralized with certain other mortgage loans. See the financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information about our indebtedness.

Market for the Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters Our Common Stock has been listed and traded on the NYSE under the symbol "AIV" since July22, 1994. The following table sets forth the quarterly high and low sales prices of the Common Stock, as reported on the NYSE, and the dividends paid for the periods indicated: Quarter Ended High Low Dividends Paid (per share) 2001 March31, 2001 $ 49.81 $ 40.31 $ 0.78 June30, 2001 48.25 42.25 0.78 September30, 2001 49.19 43.63 0.78 December31, 2001 46.56 41.44 0.78 2002 March31, 2002 48.65 42.88 0.82 June30, 2002 51.46 46.17 0.82 September30, 2002 49.44 38.61 0.82 December31, 2002 38.85 34.51 0.82 2003 March31, 2003 (through February18, 2003) 39.19 34.64 0.82 On February18, 2003, there were 93,804,497 shares of Common Stock outstanding, held by 4,451 stockholders of record, and 9,620,827 common OP Units outstanding. The number of holders does not include individuals or entities who beneficially own shares but whose shares are held of record by a broker or clearing agency, but does include each such broker or clearing agency as one recordholder.
As a REIT, we are required to distribute annually to holders of common stock at least 90% of our "real estate investment trust taxable income," which, as defined by the Code and United States Department of Treasury regulations, is generally equivalent to net taxable ordinary income. We measure our economic profitability and intend to pay regular dividends to our stockholders based on Funds From Operations, less Capital Replacements during the relevant period. However, the future payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on numerous factors including our financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the provisions of the Code applicable to REITs and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant.
From time to time, we issue shares of Common Stock in exchange for OP Units tendered to the AIMCO Operating Partnership for redemption in accordance with the terms and provisions of the agreement of limited partnership of the AIMCO Operating Partnership. Such shares are issued based on an exchange ratio of one share for each OP Unit. The shares are generally issued in exchange for OP Units in private transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section4(2) thereof. During the three and twelve months ended December31, 2002, approximately 583,000 and 1,100,000 shares of Common Stock were issued in exchange for OP Units.
Our Board of Directors has, from time to time, authorized us to repurchase shares of our outstanding capital stock. Currently, we are authorized to repurchase up to a total of approximately 1.9million shares, of which up to 1.9million shares may be Common Stock and up to 1.7million shares may be preferred stock. While we have no current plans to repurchase Common Stock or our preferred stock, these repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, subject to applicable law. During the year ended December31, 2002, we repurchased no shares of Common Stock or preferred stock.

These reclassifications primarily represent presentation changes related to discontinued operations resulting from the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.144 in 2002. Also, effective January1, 2001, we began consolidating our previously unconsolidated subsidiaries. Prior to this date, we had significant influence over, but did not control, certain subsidiaries. Accordingly, such investments were accounted for under the equity method, and as a result, the periods prior to 2001 are not comparable.
(2) In 2002, includes approximately 33,000 units that were acquired as part of the Casden Merger, and were asset managed by us only, and not also property managed.
20 ITEM7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company should be read in conjunction with the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item8 of this Annual Report. The following discussion of results of operations is based on net income calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. In addition to net income, we measure our economic profitability based on Funds From Operations, or FFO, less Capital Replacement and Capital Enhancement spending, which we refer to as Adjusted Funds From Operations, or AFFO. See the discussion of FFO and AFFO as supplemental measurements under the heading "Funds From Operations" in this Item7.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Real estate and other long-lived assets are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation, unless considered impaired. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may be impaired, we will make an assessment of its recoverability by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property.
Real estate investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. Several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our real estate investments. These factors include:  the general economic climate;  competition from other apartment communities and other housing options;  local conditions, such as an increase in unemployment or an increase in the supply of apartments, that might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates;  changes in governmental regulations and the related cost of compliance; and  changes in market rental rates.
Any adverse changes in these factors could cause an impairment in our assets, including real estate and investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships.
Notes Receivable and Interest Income Recognition We generally recognize interest income earned from our investments in notes receivable when the collectibility of such amounts is both probable and estimable. The notes receivable were either extended by us and are carried at the face amount plus accrued interest ("par value notes") or were made by predecessors whose positions we acquired usually at a discount ("discounted notes").
We continue to assess the collectibility or impairment of each note on a periodic basis. Under the cost recovery method, we carry the discounted notes at the acquisition amount, less subsequent cash collections, until such time as collectibility of principal and interest is probable and the timing and amounts are estimable. Based upon closed or pending transactions (which include sales, refinancing, foreclosures and rights offerings), we have determined that certain notes are collectible for amounts greater than their carrying value. Accordingly, we are recognizing accretion income, on a prospective basis over the estimated remaining life of the loans, as the difference between the carrying value of the discounted notes and the estimated collectible value. If we had not been able to complete certain transactions, our accretion income would have decreased by $16.0million for the year ended December31, 2002. Accretion income recognized in any given period is based on the ability to complete transactions to monetize the notes receivable and the difference between the carrying value and the estimated collectible value of the notes; therefore, accretion income in future periods could vary and could result in lower accretion income than in prior periods.
21 Allowance for Losses on Notes Receivable In estimating the collectibility of notes receivable, management's judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables including the current credit-worthiness of each borrower. Allowances are based on management's opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb losses in the existing portfolio. The allowance for losses on notes receivable is established through a provision for loss based on management's evaluation of the risk inherent in the notes receivable portfolio, the composition of the portfolio, specific impaired notes receivable and current economic conditions. Such evaluation, which includes a review of notes receivable on which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured, considers among other matters, full realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical loss experience, management's estimate of probable credit losses and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate allowance for losses on notes receivable. During the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001, we identified and recorded $9.0million and no losses on notes receivable, respectively. We will continue to monitor and assess these notes and changes in required reserves may occur in the future due to changes in the market environment.
Capitalized Costs We capitalize direct and indirect costs (including salaries, interest, real estate taxes and other costs) incurred in connection with redevelopment, initial capital expenditures, Capital Enhancement and Capital Replacement activities. Indirect costs that do not relate to the above activities, including general and administrative expenses, are charged to expense as incurred. The amounts capitalized depend on the volume, timing and costs of such activities. As a result, changes in costs and activities may have a significant effect on our results of operations and cash flows if the costs being capitalized are not proportionately increased or reduced, as the case may be. Based on the level of capital spending during 2002, if capital activities had decreased during the year by 10%, we could have had additional operating expenses of between $2.5million and $5.9million. Additionally, if capital activities had increased during the year by 10%, we could have had lower operating expenses of between $2.5million and $5.9million. See further discussion under the heading "Capital Expenditures." Results of Operations Comparison of the Year Ended December31, 2002 to the Year Ended December31, 2001 Net Income We recognized net income of $169.0million, and net income attributable to common stockholders of $75.5million, for the year ended December31, 2002, compared to net income of $107.4million, and net income attributable to common stockholders of $17.0million, for the year ended December31, 2001. Net income attributable to common stockholders represents net income less dividends accrued on preferred stock for that period.
The following paragraphs discuss the results of operations in detail.
Consolidated Rental Property Operations Rental and other property revenues from our consolidated properties totaled $1,405.7million for the year ended December31, 2002, compared with $1,224.7million for the year ended December31, 2001, an increase of $181.0million, or 14.8%. This increase in consolidated rental and other property revenues was principally a result of the following:  $148.7million of the increase related to operations of the properties acquired through three direct purchases in 2001, ten months of operations of the properties acquired through the Casden Merger and four months of operations of the properties acquired in the New England Properties Acquisition in 2002;  $70.2million of the increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in, and the subsequent consolidation of, real estate partnerships. These real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated at the end of 2001, one property that was first consolidated in the second quarter of 2002, 27 properties that were first consolidated in the third quarter of 2002 and 56 properties that were first consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2002; 22  $14.1million of an offsetting decrease related to the disposition of 25 apartment properties in 2001 (results of 2002 dispositions were included in discontinued operations); and  $8.6million of an offsetting decrease related to a 0.70% decrease in same store revenues. See further discussion of same store results under the heading "Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results." Property operating expenses for our consolidated properties, consisting of on-site payroll costs, utilities (net of reimbursements received from residents), contract services, property management fees, turnover costs, repairs and maintenance, advertising and marketing, property taxes and insurance, totaled $561.4million for the year ended December31, 2002, compared with $465.7million for the year ended December31, 2001, an increase of $95.7million or 20.5%. This increase in property operating expenses was principally a result of the following:  $58.8million of the increase related to operations of the properties acquired through three direct purchases in 2001, ten months of operations of properties acquired in the Casden Merger and four months of operations of the properties acquired in the New England Properties Acquisition in 2002;  $36.4million of the increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in, and the subsequent consolidation of, real estate partnerships. These real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated at the end of 2001, one property that was first consolidated in the second quarter of 2002, 27 properties that were first consolidated in the third quarter of 2002 and 56 properties that were first consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2002;  $4.3million of the increase related to a 0.90% increase in same store operating expense. See further discussion of same store results under the heading "Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results;"  $3.1million of the increase was related to properties in the redevelopment portfolio becoming ready for their intended use, and as a result certain operating expenses are no longer being capitalized; and  $8.8million of an offsetting decrease related to the disposition of 25 apartment properties in 2001 (results of 2002 dispositions were included in discontinued operations).
Consolidated Investment Management Business Income from the consolidated investment management business, which is primarily earned from unconsolidated real estate partnerships and the minority interest share of consolidated real estate partnerships, for which we are the general partner, was $18.3million for the year ended December31, 2002, compared to $27.6million for the year ended December31, 2001, a decrease of $9.3million or 33.7%. This decrease in income from the consolidated investment management business was principally a result of the following:  $13.2million of the decrease related to reduced fees billed for construction supervisory management services in 2002. These fees were calculated and billed to the real estate partnerships based on a percentage of volume of construction activities. In addition, lower costs were incurred and therefore lower billings occurred as a result of the ongoing management initiative to contain costs;  $7.3million of the decrease related to an increase in insurance costs in the property hazard program. These increased costs were the result of historical claim losses from prior years;  $5.5million of the decrease related to increased ownership in and number of consolidated real estate partnerships, which results in an additional elimination of management fee income and the associated property operating expense;  $4.5million of the decrease related to a net reduction in fees including: $6.9million decrease in refinancing and disposition fees, due to decreased refinancing transactions (28 in 2002 compared to 59 in 2001) resulting in lower fees earned; and $7.7million decrease in fees earned for services provided to third parties due to a planned reduction in third party asset management. This decrease was offset by a $10.1million increase in asset management and developer fees related to the NAPICO acquisition in 2002;  $2.5million of the decrease related to additional depreciation expense related primarily to the new site solutions hardware and software purchases in late 2001 and early 2002;  $14.7million of an offsetting increase related to the reduced amortization of intangibles, of which $6.8million was due to property management and asset management contract intangibles that were fully 23 amortized in 2001, and $7.9million was attributable to the elimination of goodwill amortization in accordance with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS142"); and  $9.3million of an offsetting increase related to lower compensation and health insurance expense resulting from a change in plan administrator and a reduction in work force, in part due to planned reduction in third party property management and management cost reduction initiatives.
Consolidated General and Administrative Expenses Consolidated general and administrative expenses of $20.3million for the year ended December31, 2002 increased by $1.8million from the $18.5million of such expenses for the year ended December31, 2001. This increase was principally a result of increased professional fees, primarily incurred in connection with the evaluation of the loan receivable portfolio.
Consolidated Other Expenses Consolidated other expenses were $10.2million for the year ended December31, 2002 compared to $6.4million for the year ended December31, 2001. In 2002, these expenses included the following:  $3.1million related to payments in settlement of claims asserted against us, including litigation and arbitration;  $2.2million related to the write-off of costs related to potential acquisitions that were not completed;  $0.9million was primarily related to severance and hiring costs, and costs associated with the transition of certain accounting functions from Greenville, South Carolina to our headquarters in Denver, Colorado; and  $4.0million related to personnel costs associated with annual compensation.
In 2001, we incurred $6.4million of other expenses comprised of consulting fees paid to a specialized third party vendor in connection with a systematic and comprehensive effort to improve our business processes and financial controls.
Consolidated Provision for Losses on Accounts, Fees and Notes Receivable Consolidated provision for losses on accounts, fees and notes receivable was $9.0million for the year ended December31, 2002, compared to $6.6million for the year ended December31, 2001. In 2002, all $9.0million related to provision for losses on notes receivable, which provision was determined based on our review in 2002 of the collectibility of each loan made to affiliated partnerships within our loan receivable portfolio. We will continue to monitor these loans and assess the collectibility of each loan on a periodic basis. In 2001, there was no provision for losses on notes receivable as all $6.6million related to additional allowance for possible losses on accounts, fees and other contingencies.
Consolidated Depreciation of Rental Property Consolidated depreciation of rental property decreased $38.5million, or 11.8%, to $288.6million for the year ended December31, 2002, compared to $327.1million for the year ended December31, 2001. This decrease was principally a result of the following:  $69.0million of the decrease related to the change in useful lives of assets made in 2001, which was consistent with management's expectations. During 2001, we completed a comprehensive review of our real estate related depreciation. As a result of this review, we changed our estimate of the remaining useful lives for our buildings. We believe the change better reflects the remaining useful lives of the assets and is consistent with prevailing industry practice. This change in useful lives increased net income by approximately $74.3million, net of minority interest, in 2002 over 2001, of which a portion was recognized as an increase to equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate partnerships. The recognition of this change in useful lives resulted in an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.87 and $0.86, respectively, for the year ended December31, 2002; 24  $0.8million of the decrease related to the disposition of 25 apartment properties in 2001 (results of 2002 dispositions were included in discontinued operations);  $24.0million of an offsetting increase related to depreciation of the properties acquired through three direct purchases in 2001, ten months of depreciation of the properties acquired in the Casden Merger and four months of depreciation of the properties acquired in the New England Properties Acquisition in 2002; and  $13.2million of an offsetting increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in, and the subsequent consolidation of, real estate partnerships. These real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated at the end of 2001, one property that was first consolidated in the second quarter of 2002, 27 properties that were first consolidated in the third quarter of 2002 and 56 properties that were first consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2002.
Consolidated Interest Expense Consolidated interest expense, which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs together with any prepayment penalties incurred, totaled $339.7million for the year ended December31, 2002, compared with $297.5million for the year ended December31, 2001, an increase of $42.2million, or 14.2%. The increase was principally a result of the following:  $34.8million of the increase related to interest on additional property debt acquired through three direct purchases in 2001, ten months of interest on additional property debt acquired in the Casden Merger and four months of interest on the debt related to the New England Properties Acquisition in 2002;  $17.8million of the increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in, and the subsequent consolidation of, real estate partnerships. These real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated at the end of 2001, one property that was first consolidated in the second quarter of 2002, 27 properties that were first consolidated in the third quarter of 2002 and 56 properties that were first consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2002;  $2.3million of the increase related to increased interest expense on our revolving credit facility and term loan. We had an average balance outstanding during the year ended December31, 2002 of $500.4million (including the Casden Loan), and an average balance outstanding for the year ended December31, 2001 of $236.1million (including the term loan we borrowed for the acquisition of interests in the Oxford properties). The cost of such borrowings was at a weighted average interest rate of 4.43% compared to 7.06%, respectively;  $10.9million of an offsetting decrease related to an overall decrease in variable interest rates of approximately 1.5% from the prior year; and  $2.4million of an offsetting decrease related to the disposition of 25 apartment properties in 2001 (results of 2002 dispositions were included in discontinued operations).
Consolidated Interest and Other Income Consolidated interest and other income increased $5.3million, or 7.7%, to $73.7million for the year ended December31, 2002, compared with $68.4million for the year ended December31, 2001. This increase was principally a result of the following:  $26.9million of the increase related to accretion income increasing from $9.9million, net of allocated expenses of $4.4million, for the year ended December31, 2001, compared to $36.8million, net of allocated expenses of $1.0million, for the year ended December31, 2002. This increase in accretion income was due to more completed transactions resulting in accretion occurring in 2002 than in 2001;  $18.4million of an offsetting decrease related to a decrease in recognized gain on certain tax-exempt bonds that were held in 2001 and sold in the second quarter of 2002; and  $3.8million of an offsetting decrease related to lower interest on money market and interest bearing accounts, as interest rates on deposit accounts have decreased approximately 1.5% from the prior year, while the average cash balances outstanding for both periods remained consistent.
25 Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate partnerships totaled $0.7million for the year ended December31, 2002, compared with a loss of $16.7million for the year ended December31, 2001, a change of $17.4million. This change was principally due to the change in estimate of useful lives of the underlying real estate assets completed by us in 2001, which resulted in lower depreciation expense of approximately $16.0million. See the previous discussion on the change in estimate of useful lives of assets under the heading "Consolidated Depreciation of Rental Property." Minority Interest in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships Minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships totaled $15.1million for the year ended December31, 2002, compared to $37.6million for the year ended December31, 2001, a decrease of $22.5million. This decrease is primarily a result of our purchase of additional interests in consolidated real estate partnerships and a reduction in net income, thereby reducing the minority interest allocation.
Gain (Loss) on Dispositions of Real Estate Loss on dispositions of real estate, primarily by unconsolidated entities, totaled $27.9million for the year ended December31, 2002, compared to a gain of $17.4million for the year ended December31, 2001, a change of $45.3million. Part of this change was a result of our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.144 , Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of ("SFAS144") effective January1, 2002, where we now report assets held for sale (as defined by SFAS144) and assets sold in the current period, as discontinued operations. Due to this adoption, for the year ended December31, 2002, gain (loss) on dispositions of real estate does not include any gain or loss associated with the disposal of consolidated properties that were classified as discontinued operations during 2002. For 2001, however, gain (loss) on dispositions of real estate included gain or loss associated with the disposal of all properties sold. The properties sold in both periods, as well as the properties held for sale, were considered by management to be inconsistent with our long-term investment strategy. Gain (loss) on properties sold were determined on a property by property basis and are not entirely comparable year over year due to individual property differences.
Included in gain (loss) on dispositions of real estate, we recorded a loss of approximately $28.0million. This $28.0million loss resulted primarily from a change in estimate due to better insight into information related to the finalization of the recording of purchase price accounting to appropriate entities acquired in past acquisitions and the related historical estimation process in determining the carrying value of assets sold. The recognition of this amount in the current period is considered to be a change in estimate associated with the historical estimated gain or loss on the sale of these properties. The recognition of this change in estimate resulted in a decrease in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.28 for the year ended December31, 2002. In addition to the $28.0million loss discussed above, we recorded approximately $9.0million of impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, offset by approximately $9.0million of net casualty gains.
Distributions to Minority Partners in Excess of Income Distributions to minority partners in excess of income decreased $19.4million to $27.0million for the year ended December31, 2002, compared to $46.4million for the year ended December31, 2001. When real estate partnerships consolidated in our financial statements make cash distributions in excess of net income, generally accepted accounting principles require us, as the majority partner, to record a charge equal to the minority partners' excess of distributions over net income when the partnership is in a deficit equity position, even though we do not suffer any economic effect, cost or risk. This decrease was due to a reduced level of distributions being made by the consolidated real estate partnerships as a result of lower refinancing activity, and our increased ownership of such partnerships.
Discontinued Operations Loss from discontinued operations was $6.1million for the year ended December31, 2002, compared to income of $4.2million for the year ended December31, 2001, a change of $10.3million. As a result of the adoption of SFAS144, effective January1, 2002, we now report assets classified as held for sale (as defined by SFAS144) and assets sold in the current period, as discontinued operations. For the year ended December31, 2002, discontinued operations included the operations of the properties sold and classified as held for sale in 2002 and the associated gain (loss) on the disposition of the properties. For the year ended December31, 2001, discontinued operations included the 2001 operations of the properties sold and classified as held for sale in 2002. There were no gains or 26 losses on assets sold in 2001 included in discontinued operations for the year ended December31, 2001. The change in discontinued operations was primarily related to a net loss on disposals of $9.0million for the year ended December31, 2002. We incurred net losses of $21.0million from the sale of certain senior living facilities, which we deemed non-strategic assets. In addition, approximately $3.0million of impairment losses were recorded on properties that were classified as held for sale. These losses were partially offset by $15.0million in net gains on the sale of other discontinued operations properties. The properties sold, as well as the properties classified as held for sale, were considered by management to be inconsistent with our long-term investment strategy. See Note27 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more details on discontinued operations.
Comparison of the Year Ended December31, 2001 to the Year Ended December31, 2000 Effective January1, 2001, we began consolidating our previously unconsolidated subsidiaries (see Note6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report). Prior to this date, we had significant influence over, but did not have control of, such subsidiaries. Accordingly, such investments were accounted for under the equity method. Under the equity method, our pro-rata share of the earnings or losses of the entity for the periods being presented was included in equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries. In order for a meaningful analysis of the financial statements to be made, the revenues and expenses for the unconsolidated subsidiaries for the year ended December31, 2000, have been included in the following analysis as though they had been consolidated, and as a result the 2000 amounts are different than the historical information as previously reported. All significant intercompany revenues and expenses have been eliminated. Dollar amounts are in thousands.
Year Ended December31, 2001 2000 RENTAL PROPERTY OPERATIONS: Rental and other property revenues $ 1,224,667 $ 1,028,510 Property operating expenses (465,721 ) (429,642 ) Income from property operations 758,946 598,868 INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS: Management fees and other income primarily from affiliates 158,367 159,888 Management and other expenses (112,047 ) (108,574 ) Amortization of intangibles (18,729 ) (12,070 ) Income from investment management business 27,591 39,244 General and administrative expenses (18,530 ) (18,123 ) Other expenses (6,400 )  Provision for losses on accounts, fees and notes receivable (6,646 )  Depreciation of rental property (327,070 ) (290,612 ) Interest expense (297,507 ) (274,315 ) Interest and other income 68,417 70,545 Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated real estate partnerships (16,662 ) 5,246 Minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships (37,619 ) (27,451 ) Operating earnings 144,520 103,402 Gain on dispositions of real estate 17,394 26,335 Distributions to minority partners in excess of income (46,359 ) (24,375 ) Income before minority interest in AIMCO Operating Partnership and discontinued operations 115,555 105,362 Minority interest in AIMCO Operating Partnership, preferred (9,803 ) (7,020 ) Minority interest in AIMCO Operating Partnership, common (2,639 ) (3,519 ) Income from continuing operations 103,113 94,823 Discontinued operations: Income from discontinued operations, net 4,239 4,355 Net income $ 107,352 $ 99,178 Net income attributable to preferred stockholders $ 90,331 $ 63,183 Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 17,021 $ 35,995 27 Net Income We recognized net income of $107.4million, and net income attributable to common stockholders of $17.0million, for the year ended December31, 2001, compared to net income of $99.2million, and net income attributable to common stockholders of $36.0million for the year ended December31, 2000. Net income attributable to common stockholders represents net income less dividends accrued on preferred stock for that period.
The following paragraphs discuss the results of operations in detail.
Consolidated Rental Property Operations Rental and other property revenues from consolidated properties totaled $1,224.7million for the year ended December31, 2001, compared with $1,028.5million for the year ended December31, 2000, an increase of $196.2million, or 19.1%. This increase in consolidated rental and other property revenues was principally a result of the following:  $130.0million of the increase related to operations of the properties acquired through three direct purchases in 2001 and operations of the properties acquired through the Oxford acquisition and 12 other properties acquired in the third and fourth quarters of 2000;  $58.5million of the increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in, and the subsequent consolidation of, real estate partnerships. These real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated in 2001 and 79 properties that were first consolidated after the first quarter of 2000;  $38.2million of the increase related to a 3.6% increase in same store revenues; and  $34.9million of an offsetting decrease related to the disposition of 25 properties in 2001 and 22 properties after the first quarter of 2000.
Property operating expenses from our consolidated properties, consisting of on-site payroll costs, utilities (net of reimbursements received from residents), contract services, property management fees, turnover costs, repairs and maintenance, advertising and marketing, property taxes and insurance, totaled $465.7million for the year ended December31, 2001, compared with $429.6million for the year ended December31, 2000, an increase of $36.1million or 8.4%. This increase in consolidated property operating expenses was principally a result of the following:  $37.8million of the increase related to operations of the properties acquired through three direct purchases in 2001 and operations of the properties acquired through the Oxford acquisition and 12 other properties acquired in the third and fourth quarters of 2000;  $25.6million of the increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in, and the subsequent consolidation of, real estate partnerships. These real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated in 2001 and 79 properties that were first consolidated after the first quarter of 2000;  $18.0million of the increase related to a 4.4% increase in same store expenses;  $26.9million of an offsetting decrease related to the capitalization of construction-related costs; and  $18.2million of an offsetting decrease related to the disposition of 25 properties in 2001 and 22 properties after the first quarter of 2000.
Consolidated Investment Management Business Income from the consolidated investment management business, which is primarily earned from unconsolidated real estate partnerships and the minority interest share of consolidated real estate partnerships, for which we are the general partner, was $27.6million for the year ended December31, 2001, compared with $39.2million for the year ended December31, 2000, a decrease of $11.6million or 29.6%. This decrease in consolidated investment management business was principally a result of the following:  $22.0million of the decrease related to the reduction in the number of properties managed, including approximately 225 for third parties; 28  $6.6million of the decrease related to increased amortization of intangibles from additional property and asset management contract intangibles that were acquired as part of the acquisition of the Oxford properties;  $5.6million of the decrease related to losses from health and property casualty insurance claims;  $2.5million of the decrease related to the increased ownership in controlled, consolidated partnerships, which requires additional elimination of management fee income and the associated property management expense;  $10.3million of an offsetting increase related to fees resulting from additional construction supervisory management services in 2001. These fees were calculated and billed to the real estate partnerships based on a percentage of volume of construction activities;  $9.7million of an offsetting increase related to increased capitalization of direct and indirect costs related to construction, redevelopment, Capital Enhancement and Capital Replacement activities; and  $4.6million of an offsetting increase related to additional accounting and other fees earned from the Oxford properties, which were acquired by us in September2000.
Consolidated General and Administrative and Other Expenses Consolidated general and administrative expenses remained consistent, with $18.5million for the year ended December31, 2001 compared with $18.1million for the year ended December31, 2000.
We incurred $6.4million of consulting fees paid to a specialized third party vendor for the year ended December31, 2001 in connection with a systematic and comprehensive effort to improve our business processes and financial controls. This effort resulted in identifying many initiatives to eliminate work and reduce costs. Three of the main themes were to increase focus on the operation of the conventional properties, strengthen corporate support to field operations and increase focus on the realization of equity values embedded in our portfolio of affordable properties. In 2001, we transferred affordable property management to a team separate from conventional property management, and reduced our business of providing property management services to unrelated third parties from 60,669 units at the end of 2000 to 31,520 units by the end of 2001, in order to focus on the operation of conventional properties. We have strengthened a number of our corporate functions including: purchasing, which has provided for lower costs; marketing, to improve traffic; human resources, to improve the recruitment, training and retention of top performers; financial control, to provide more timely financial information; and information technology systems, which includes the pending installation of an on site property management program.
Additionally, for the year ended December31, 2001, we provided for an additional allowance of $6.6million for possible losses on accounts, fees and other contingencies.
Consolidated Depreciation of Rental Property Consolidated depreciation of rental property totaled $327.1million for the year ended December31, 2001, compared with $290.6million for the year ended December31, 2000, an increase of $36.5million or 12.6%. This increase was principally a result of the following:  $51.5million of the increase related to operations of the properties acquired through three direct purchases in 2001 and operations of the properties acquired through the Oxford acquisition and 12 other properties acquired in the third and fourth quarters of 2000;  $12.9million of the increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in, and the subsequent consolidation of, real estate partnerships. These real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated in 2001 and 79 properties that were first consolidated after the first quarter of 2000;  $12.0million of the increase related to depreciable additions to same store properties;  $34.0million of an offsetting decrease related to the change in useful lives of assets. During 2001, we completed a comprehensive review of our real estate related depreciation. As a result of this review, we changed our estimate of the remaining useful lives for our buildings. Effective July1, 2001 for certain 29 assets and October1, 2001 for the majority of the portfolio, we extended useful lives of these assets from a weighted average composite life of 25years to a weighted average composite life of 30years. This change increased net income by approximately $31million, net of minority interest, or $0.42 per diluted share in 2001. We believe the change better reflects the remaining useful lives of the assets and is consistent with prevailing industry practice; and  $7.8million of an offsetting decrease related to the disposition of 25 properties in 2001 and 22 properties after the first quarter of 2000.
Consolidated Interest Expense Consolidated interest expense, which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, totaled $297.5million for the year ended December31, 2001, compared with $274.3million for the year ended December31, 2000, an increase of $23.2million or 8.5%. This increase was principally a result of the following:  $38.4million of the increase related to operations of the properties acquired through three direct purchases in 2001 and operations of the properties acquired through the Oxford acquisition and 12 other properties acquired in the third and fourth quarters of 2000;  $13.2million of the increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in, and the subsequent consolidation of, real estate partnerships. These real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated in 2001 and 79 properties that were first consolidated after the first quarter of 2000;  $14.1million of an offsetting decrease related to lower interest expense on our line of credit. We had lower average balances outstanding during the year, and the cost of such borrowing was at a weighted average interest rate of 6.64% for the year ended December31, 2001 compared to 8.95% for the year ended December31, 2000;  $7.3million of an offsetting decrease related to a reduction in interest expense paid on our mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities, as approximately 2.4million and 0.2million of these securities were converted into Common Stock in late 2000 and in 2001, respectively; and  $6.3million of an offsetting decrease related to the disposition of 25 properties in 2001 and 22 properties occurring after the first quarter of 2000.
Consolidated Interest and Other Income Consolidated interest and other income decreased $2.1million or 3.0% from $70.5million for the year ended December31, 2000, compared to $68.4million for the year ended December31, 2001. This decrease was principally the result of the following:  $16.5million of the decrease related to a reduction in accretion income of discounted notes from $26.4million, net of allocated expenses of $4.3million, for the year ended December31, 2000 to $9.9million, net of allocated expenses of $4.4million, for the year ended December31, 2001. This decrease in accretion income was due to fewer loans and fewer transactions completed that resulted in accretion income.
$10.0million of the decrease related to lower interest from money market and interest bearing accounts as interest rates on deposit accounts had decreased approximately 200 basis points from the prior year, as well as we had lower average cash balances ($87.8million in 2001, compared to $113.8million in 2000) due to the paydown of certain obligations and distributions to minority interest partners.
$26.1million of an offsetting increase related to the gain recognized from the sale of certain tax-exempt bonds.
Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships Equity in losses from unconsolidated real estate partnerships totaled $16.7million for the year ended December31, 2001, compared to earnings of $5.2million for the year ended December31, 2000, a decrease of $21.9million. The acquisition of interests in the Oxford properties in 2000 contributed $2.1million to the earnings of unconsolidated real estate partnerships. However, this was offset by the purchase of additional partnership interests 30 which resulted in the related properties being consolidated and contributing to consolidated rental revenues and expenses (seven properties in 2001 and 80 properties in 2000).
Minority Interest in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships Minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships totaled $37.6million for the year ended December31, 2001, compared to $27.5million for the year ended December31, 2000, a change of $10.1million. The change was primarily a result of our purchase of additional interests in real estate partnerships, thereby reducing the minority interest allocation.
Distributions to Minority Partners in Excess of Income Distributions to minority partners in excess of income increased $22.0million from $24.4million for the year ended December31, 2000 to $46.4million for the year ended December31, 2001. When real estate partnerships consolidated in our financial statements make cash distributions in excess of net income, generally accepted accounting principles require us, as the majority partner, to record a charge equal to the minority partners' excess of distribution over net income when the partnership is in a deficit equity position, even though we do not suffer any economic effect, cost or risk. The increase for the year occurred due to increased refinancing and operating activity, resulting in an increased amount of cash distributions to minority interest partners.
Gain on Dispositions of Real Estate Gain on dispositions of real estate totaled $17.4million for the year ended December31, 2001, compared to $26.3million for the year ended December31, 2000, a decrease of $8.9million. The sales in both periods are of properties that are considered by management to be inconsistent with our long-term investment strategy. Gains (losses) on properties sold were determined on a property by property basis and are not entirely comparable year over year due to individual property differences.
Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations was $4.2million for the year ended December31, 2001, compared to $4.4million for the year ended December31, 2000. As a result of the adoption of SFAS144, effective January1, 2002, we now report assets classified as held for sale (as defined by SFAS144) and assets sold in the current period, as discontinued operations. This change has resulted in certain reclassifications of 2001 and 2000 financial statement amounts, as all results of operations for those properties sold or classified as held for sale in 2002 must be included in a separate component of income on the consolidated statements of income for all comparable periods. For the year ended December31, 2001 and 2000, discontinued operations included the operations of the properties sold or classified as held for sale in 2002. There are no gains or losses on assets sold in 2001 or 2000 included in discontinued operations for the years ended December31, 2001 and 2000. See Note27 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on discontinued operations.
31 Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results We define "same store" properties as conventional apartment properties in which our ownership interest exceeds 10% and operations are stabilized for over one year in the comparable periods of 2002 and 2001. "Total portfolio" includes same store properties plus conventional acquisition and redevelopment properties. The following table summarizes the unaudited conventional rental property operations on a "same store" and a "total portfolio" basis (dollars in thousands): Conventional Same Store Conventional Total Portfolio 2002 2001 2002 2001 Properties 620 620 665 636 Apartment units 173,397 173,397 188,966 179,876 Average physical occupancy 92.5 % 93.3 % 91.4 % 92.1 % Average rent collected/unit/month $ 693 $ 694 $ 714 $ 679 Revenues $ 1,130,477 $ 1,138,481 $ 1,242,398 $ 1,172,299 Expenses 420,879 417,254 465,997 436,156 Net operating income $ 709,598 $ 721,227 $ 776,401 $ 736,143 Same store net operating income decreased $11.6million, or 1.6%, for the year ended December31, 2002 compared to the year ended December31, 2001. Revenues decreased $8.0million, or 0.7%, primarily due to lower average rent (down $1 per unit), lower occupancy (down 0.8%), and increased bad debt; all of which were somewhat offset by an increase in ancillary income. Expenses increased by $3.6million, or 0.9%, primarily due to an increase of $5.3million in property taxes as well as increased insurance expense of $1.5million as the cost of property hazard insurance coverage rose in March2002. These increases were somewhat offset by reductions in other categories. Same store expenses for both periods presented above are net of capitalized costs. The same store net operating results above represent 88.5% and 92.0% of total Free Cash Flow for the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
32 Funds From Operations We believe that FFO and AFFO, when considered with the financial data determined in accordance with GAAP, provide investors with an understanding of our ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures. These supplemental measures capture real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than machinery, computers or other personal property. The Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines FFO as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, disposals of depreciable real estate property, net of related income taxes, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of financing costs), including depreciation for unconsolidated real estate partnerships and joint ventures and discontinued operations. We calculate FFO based on the NAREIT definition, as further adjusted for minority interest in the AIMCO Operating Partnership, plus amortization of intangibles, plus distributions to minority partners in excess of income and less dividends on preferred stock. We calculate FFO (diluted) by adding back the interest expense and preferred dividends relating to convertible securities whose conversion is dilutive to FFO. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. FFO is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs. In addition, although FFO is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of real estate investment trusts, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts.
For the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, our FFO is calculated as follows (amounts in thousands): 2002 2001 2000 Net Income $ 169,046 $ 107,352 $ 99,178 Adjustments: Real estate depreciation, net of minority interest 260,507 316,101 256,917 Real estate depreciation related to unconsolidated entities 33,544 57,506 70,188 Loss (gain) on dispositions of real estate 27,902 (17,394 ) (26,335 ) Distributions to minority partners in excess of income 26,979 46,359 24,375 Amortization of intangibles 4,026 18,729 12,068 Income tax arising from disposals  3,202  Gain on disposition of land  3,843  Discontinued operations: Real estate depreciation, net of minority interest 10,403 16,948 9,997 Loss on disposals, net of minority interest 8,958   Distributions to minority partners in excess of income 1,321 1,342  Income tax arising from disposals 2,507   Other items: Deferred income tax benefit   154 Interest expense on mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities 1,161 1,568 8,869 Preferred stock dividends and distributions (60,272 ) (35,747 ) (26,120 ) Minority interest in AIMCO Operating Partnership 23,908 12,442 10,539 Diluted Funds From Operations available to common shares, and equivalents $ 509,990 $ 532,251 $ 439,830 Weighted average number of common shares and equivalents: Common shares and equivalents 86,773 73,648 69,063 Preferred stock, preferred OP Units, and other securities convertible into common shares 10,847 17,187 15,308 Common OP Units and equivalents 12,395 11,312 7,135 110,015 102,147 91,506 Cash flow provided by operating activities $ 497,289 $ 494,457 $ 400,364 Cash flow used in investing activities (786,377 ) (132,010 ) (546,981 ) Cash flow provided by (used in) financing activities 308,641 (439,562 ) 202,128 33 Contribution to Free Cash Flow We look at our Free Cash Flow as a means of monitoring the operations of the components of our business. In this regard, in addition to the year-to-year comparative discussion, we have provided disclosure (see Note24 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report) on the contribution (separated between consolidated and unconsolidated activity) to our Free Cash Flow from several components of our business, and a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to FFO, less Capital Replacements and Capital Enhancements, and to net income for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. We define Free Cash Flow as FFO, less Capital Replacements and Capital Enhancements, plus interest expense and preferred stock dividends.
The following table summarizes the contributions to our Free Cash Flow (dollars in thousands): 2002 2001 2000 Amount Contr.% Amount Contr.% Amount Contr.% Real estate $ 745,864 93 % $ 700,702 89 % $ 575,888 85 % Investment management business: Property and asset management 13,388 2 % 32,538 4 % 40,954 6 % Activity based fees 8,900 1 % 13,782 2 % 7,438 1 % Interest income: recurring 29,155 3 % 32,378 4 % 41,996 6 % Interest income: transactional 44,539 6 % 36,039 5 % 26,409 4 % General and administrative and other expenses and provision for losses (39,550 ) (5 %) (31,576 ) (4 %) (18,123 ) (2 %) Total Free Cash Flow $ 802,296 100 % $ 783,863 100 % $ 674,562 100 % Comparison of the Year Ended December31, 2002 to the Year Ended December31, 2001 Total Free Cash Flow contributed was $802.3million and $783.9million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, an increase of $18.4million or 2.3%.
The real estate Free Cash Flow contribution was $745.9million and $700.7million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, an increase of $45.2million or 6.5%. Real estate contribution to total Free Cash Flow increased to 93% in 2002 from 89% in 2001. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions ($88.7million), offset by a decrease due to increased Capital Replacement and Capital Enhancement spending ($31.8million), and a decrease in same store operating results ($12.6million).
The property and asset management income within the investment management business contributed $13.4million (2%) and $32.5million (4%) to Free Cash Flow in 2002 and 2001, respectively. This decrease is primarily a result of (a)a reduction in fees related to construction supervisory management services, (b)a reduction in management fees and other income earned due to a decrease in the number of properties managed, including third parties, (c)an increase in losses from property casualty insurance claims, and (d)a reduction due to the increased ownership in and number of consolidated real estate partnerships, which results in additional elimination of management fee income and the associated property operating expense. These decreases in Free Cash Flow were partially offset by increases in Free Cash Flow as a result of a decrease in compensation and health insurance expense. Activity based fees contributed $8.9million (1%) and $13.8million (2%) to Free Cash Flow in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Activity based fees are earned on partnership refinancing, sales and other transactions. This decrease was primarily due to decreased refinancing transactions resulting in fees (28 in 2002 compared to 59 in 2001).
Recurring interest income decreased $3.2million primarily as a result of a decrease in interest income from money market and interest bearing accounts while general partner loan interest remained consistent. Money market and interest bearing accounts decreased as interest rates on deposit accounts have decreased approximately 1.5% from the prior year, while the average cash balances outstanding for both periods remained consistent. The transactional related interest income contribution was $44.5million (6%) and $36.0million (5%) of Free Cash Flow contribution in 2002 and 2001, respectively, an increase of $8.5million. Transactional interest income was comprised of gain on sale of bonds and accretion income on discounted notes. We hold investments in both par value notes receivable and discounted notes receivable. Accretion income on discounted notes increased $26.9million from 2001 due to more completed transactions in 2002. Offsetting this increase was a decrease of $18.4million related to the recognized gain on sale of certain tax-exempt bonds that were held in 2001 and sold in the second quarter of 2002.
34 Contributions to conventional real estate Free Cash Flow for 2002, 2001 and 2000 before adjustment for minority interest were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2002 2001 2000 Amount Contr.% Amount Contr.% Amount Contr.% Average monthly rent greater than $1,200 per unit $ 86,616 12 % $ 47,943 7 % $ 24,917 4 % Average monthly rent $1,000 to $1,200 per unit 56,602 8 % 46,854 6 % 30,005 5 % Average monthly rent $900 to $1,000 per unit 93,763 12 % 78,737 11 % 28,729 5 % Average monthly rent $800 to $900 per unit 82,076 11 % 95,658 13 % 61,832 10 % Average monthly rent $700 to $800 per unit 102,112 14 % 104,704 14 % 70,857 12 % Average monthly rent $600 to $700 per unit 151,339 20 % 184,496 25 % 156,554 27 % Average monthly rent $500 to $600 per unit 131,429 18 % 137,023 19 % 158,461 27 % Average monthly rent less than $500 per unit 37,084 5 % 37,362 5 % 56,271 10 % Total conventional real estate contribution to Free Cash Flow before adjustment for minority interest $ 741,021 100 % $ 732,777 100 % $ 587,626 100 % The conventional real estate contribution to Free Cash Flow was $741.0million and $732.8million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, an increase of $8.2million or 1.1%. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions ($53.7million), offset by a decrease due to increased Capital Replacement and Capital Enhancement spending ($26.9million), a decrease in same store operating results ($12.6million), and a decrease due to 2001 dispositions ($5.3million).
The changes in the composition of conventional real estate contribution resulted in an increase in contribution from properties with an average monthly rent greater than $900 per unit to 32% from 24% in 2001, and a decrease in contribution from properties with an average monthly rent below $600 per unit to 23% from 24% in 2001. The changes were due to acquisitions offset by decreases in property operations and dispositions.
Note24 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report provides additional detail on each component of Free Cash Flow. We believe this disclosure is complementary to the results of operations discussed above.
Comparison of the Year Ended December31, 2001 to the Year Ended December31, 2000 Total Free Cash Flow contributed was $783.9million and $674.6million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, an increase of $109.3million or 16.2%.
The real estate Free Cash Flow contribution was $700.7million and $575.9million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, an increase of $124.8million or 21.7%. Real estate contribution to total Free Cash Flow increased to 89% in 2001 from 85% in 2000. The increase was due to improvements in property operations (96%), acquisitions (2%) and limited partnership acquisitions (2%).
The property and asset management income within the investment management business contributed $32.5million (4%) and $41.0million (6%) to Free Cash Flow in 2001 and 2000, respectively. This decrease is primarily a result of (a)a reduction in management fees and other income earned due to a decrease in the number of properties managed, including third parties, (b)an increase in losses from health and property casualty insurance claims and (c)a reduction due to the increased ownership in controlled, consolidated partnerships, which requires additional elimination of management fee income and the associated property management expense. These decreases in Free Cash Flow were partially offset by increases in Free Cash Flow as a result of (a)an increase in property and asset management income resulting from additional fees due to the acquisition of the Oxford properties in September2000, (b)an increase in property and asset management income as we earned additional construction supervisory management services in 2001 and (c)an increase in the capitalization of direct and indirect costs related to construction, redevelopment, Capital Enhancement and Capital Replacement activities. Activity based fees contributed $13.8million (2%) and $7.4million (1%) to Free Cash Flow in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Activity based fees are earned on partnership refinancing, sales and other transactions. The increase in fee income is due to increased refinancing fees of $10.4million in 2001, compared to $4.0million in 2000.
Recurring interest income decreased $9.6million primarily as a result of a decrease in interest income from money market and interest bearing accounts. We had $80.0million in cash as of December31, 2001, compared to $157.1million at December31, 2000 due to the paydown of certain obligations such as the term loan and revolving 35 credit facility, and interest rates on deposit accounts having decreased approximately 200 basis points. The transactional related interest income contribution was $36.0million (5%) and $26.4million (4%) of Free Cash Flow contribution in 2001 and 2000, an increase of $9.6million. Transactional interest income was comprised of gain on sale of bonds and accretion income on discounted notes. We hold investments in both par value notes receivable and discounted notes. Accretion income on discounted notes decreased $16.5million from 2000 due to fewer loans and fewer transactions completed. However, this was offset by a $26.1million gain recognized from the sale of certain tax-exempt bonds.
The conventional real estate contribution to Free Cash Flow was $732.8million and $587.6million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, an increase of $145.2million or 24.7%. The increase was due to improvements in property operations (96%), acquisitions (2%) and acquisition of limited partnership interests (2%).
The changes in the composition of conventional real estate contribution resulted in an increase in contribution from properties with an average monthly rent greater than $900 per unit to 24% from 14% in 2000, and a decrease in contribution from properties with an average monthly rent below $600 per unit to 24% from 37% in 2000. The changes were due to improvements in property operations, acquisitions, limited partnership acquisitions and dispositions.
Note24 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report provides additional detail on each component of Free Cash Flow. We believe this disclosure is complementary to the results of operations discussed above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through the sale or maturity of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds through working capital management. Both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective working capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity. Our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates, occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment properties, as well as cash flow from operations generated by our investment management business.
Our principal demands for liquidity include normal operating activities, payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt, capital expenditures, acquisitions of and investments in properties, dividends paid to stockholders and distributions paid to limited partners. We consider our cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet short-term liquidity demands. In the event that there continues to be an economic downturn or the national economy continues to deteriorate and the cash provided by operating activities is no longer adequate, we have additional means, such as short-term borrowing availability, to help us meet our short-term liquidity demands. We use our revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund investments on an interim basis. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, such as debt maturities and property acquisitions, through long-term borrowings, both secured and unsecured, the issuance of debt or equity securities (including OP Units), the sale of properties and cash generated from operations.
At December31, 2002, we had $99.6million in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $19.6million from December31, 2001. In addition, we had $224.9million of restricted cash ($70million of which was acquired in the Casden Merger), primarily consisting of reserves and impounds held by lenders for bond sinking funds, capital expenditures, property taxes and insurance. In addition, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are held by partnerships that are not presented on a consolidated basis. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item8 of this Annual Report.
Operating Activities For the year ended December31, 2002, our net cash provided by operating activities was $497.3million, compared to $494.5million for the year ended December31, 2001. This decline is due primarily to the economic downturn in the national economy and the related deterioration in our operating activities, as well as an increase in our level of operating assets, partially offset by a decrease in our operating liabilities.
Investing Activities For the year ended December31, 2002, our net cash used in investing activities was $786.4million compared to $132.0million for the year ended December31, 2001. In 2002 our investing activities related to investments in acquisitions and our existing real estate assets through capital expenditures and redevelopment, as well as 36 dispositions of apartment properties. See further discussion on capital expenditures under the heading "Capital Expenditures." Our acquisitions included the Casden Merger and the New England Properties Acquisition. In addition, we acquired the Villas at Park La Brea and made various acquisitions of limited partnership interests held by third party investors in certain partnerships for which we act as the general partner. See Note4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for further discussion on these activities.
Although we hold all of our properties for investment, we sell properties when they do not meet our investment criteria or are located in areas that we believe do not justify our continued investment, in both cases as compared to alternative uses for our capital. The table below shows our dispositions during the year ended December31, 2002: Property Type Number of Properties Gross Proceeds Existing Debt / Transaction Costs Net Proceeds Our Share of Net Proceeds (in millions) (in millions) (in millions) (in millions) Conventional 53 $ 339.6 $ 204.9 $ 134.7 $ 107.4 Commercial 1 0.7  0.7 0.1 Affordable 26 72.5 42.0 30.5 12.0 Senior Living 7 139.0 120.4 18.6 17.7 Total 87 $ 551.8 $ 367.3 $ 184.5 $ 137.2 We are currently marketing for sale certain real estate properties that are inconsistent with our long-term investment strategies (as determined by management from time to time). Proceeds from 2003 dispositions are expected to be at levels above that of 2002, and are planned to be used to reduce debt and fund capital and other operating needs.
Financing Activities For the year ended December31, 2002, net cash provided by financing activities was $308.6million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $439.6million for the year ended December31, 2001. In 2002 our financing activities related to mortgage financing, short-term debt financing, issuance of common and preferred equity, payment of our dividends and payment of our principal debt amortization.
During the year ended December31, 2002, we refinanced or closed 93 mortgage loans generating $1,031.7million of total proceeds at a weighted average interest rate of 4.26%, of which approximately $937.9million related to consolidated properties (these mortgages do not include the $308.7million in mortgage loans related to the New England Properties Acquisition that are discussed below). Each loan is non-recourse. Among the 93 loans, 81 are individually secured by one of 81 properties with no cross-collateralization, and 12 loans totaling $228.4million are cross-collateralized with certain other mortgage loans. After repayment of existing debt and payment of transaction costs totaling $832.0million, our share of the total $199.7million in net proceeds was $165.8million which was used to repay existing short-term debt and for other corporate purposes. Further details on these mortgage loans are shown in the table below: Mortgage Type Loan Amount Term Rate (in millions) Conventional Fixed Rate $ 174.5 Up to 20 yr, 20 yr amortization 6.49 % Conventional Fixed Rate 129.5 Up to 10 yr, 30 yr amortization 7.01 Conventional Variable Rate 241.0 3 yr revolving facility 2.85 Tax-Exempt Variable Rate 376.8 5-10 yrs 2.47 Affordable Fixed Rate 109.9 15-30 yrs, fully amortizing 6.67 $ 1,031.7 4.26 % In connection with the Casden Merger, we assumed $684.7million of primarily long-term, fixed-rate, fully amortizing notes payable with a weighted average interest rate of 6.85%. Each of the notes is individually secured by one of 116 properties with no cross-collateralization.
37 In connection with the New England Properties Acquisition, we closed 11 mortgage loans generating $308.7million of long-term, fixed rate, fully amortizing notes with a weighted average interest rate of 5.69%. Each loan is non-recourse and is individually secured by one of the 11 properties, with no cross-collateralization.
In connection with our purchase of the Villas at Park La Brea, we closed a $38.0million, long-term, fixed rate, fully amortizing note with an interest rate of 6.01%. This note is non-recourse and secured by the property.
As of December31, 2002, substantially all of the Company's owned or controlled properties and 86.5% of our total assets were encumbered by or served as collateral for debt. As of December31, 2002, we had total secured outstanding indebtedness of $6,233.7million, comprised of $4,582.9million of secured long-term financing, $1,244.8million of secured tax-exempt long-term bond financing and $406.0million in secured short-term financing. As of December31, 2002, approximately 22.6% of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates, of which $786.2million, or 12.6%, is tax-exempt bond financing. As of December31, 2002, we had a total of 49 mortgage loans, with an aggregate principal balance outstanding of $573.4million, that were cross-collateralized with certain other mortgage loans. Other than these loans, none of our debt is subject to cross-collateralization provisions. The weighted average interest rate on our long-term secured notes payable and tax-exempt bonds was 6.49%, with a weighted average maturity of 14years as of December31, 2002.
In 2002 we issued the following equity:  3.5million shares of Common Stock, valued at $164.9million, in connection with the Casden Merger  2.0million shares of ClassR Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, in two registered public offerings, with total net proceeds of approximately $50million used to repay short-term indebtedness  8.0million shares of Common Stock in a registered public offering at a net price of $46.17 per share. The total net proceeds of approximately $369million were used to repay outstanding indebtedness on our revolving credit facility and a portion of the Casden Loan.
Our Board of Directors has, from time to time, authorized us to repurchase shares of Common Stock and our preferred stock. Currently, we are authorized to repurchase up to a total of approximately 1.9million shares, of which up to 1.9million shares may be Common Stock and up to 1.7million shares may be preferred stock. While we have no current plans to repurchase Common Stock or our preferred stock, these repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, subject to applicable law. During the year ended December31, 2002, we repurchased no shares of Common Stock or preferred stock.
It is the present policy of our Board of Directors to increase the dividend annually in an amount equal to one-half of the projected increase in AFFO subject to minimum distribution requirements to maintain our REIT status. Our Board of Directors considers the discretionary nature of Capital Enhancement spending in its consideration of AFFO as it relates to our dividend policy. The dividend paid in February2003 of $0.82 per share, which was the same dividend amount as was paid in each quarter of 2002, represents a distribution of 96% of AFFO (before deducting Capital Enhancements) and 78% of FFO for the quarter ended December31, 2002. We continue to monitor the dividend as a percentage of AFFO (before deducting Capital Enhancements). If the payout were to exceed 100% for a sustained period, our Board of Directors would consider a change in the dividend to match our operating profitability.
On November7, 2001, AIMCO and the AIMCO Operating Partnership filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, with respect to an aggregate of $822million of debt and equity securities of AIMCO and $500million of debt securities of the AIMCO Operating Partnership, all of which was carried forward from AIMCO's 1998 shelf registration statement. The SEC declared the registration statement effective on November9, 2001. As of December31, 2002, we had approximately $400million of debt and equity available and the AIMCO Operating Partnership had $500million of debt available from this registration statement. We expect to finance acquisitions of real estate interests with the issuance of equity and debt securities under the shelf registration statement as well as with cash from operations or short-term borrowings.
38 Credit Facility and Term Loan On February14, 2003, we and our lenders amended our revolving credit facility to increase the available commitment, at our option, to $500million (such commitment in excess of $400million is not available until it has been syndicated), reduce the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio from 1.60:1 to 1.50:1 through the maturity date and extend the maturity date one year to July31, 2005. Upon the effective date of the amendment, the margin on LIBOR-based loans and base rate loans was amended to a range between 2.05% to 2.65% and .55% to 1.15%, respectively, based on the fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, we and our lenders amended the Casden Loan with the same reduction in the fixed charge coverage ratio as stated above for the credit facility, through maturity, and to eliminate mandatory prepayments for the remainder of the term using proceeds from equity, sales or refinancing proceeds (except as such proceeds arise from transactions of the properties acquired in the Casden Merger).
The financial covenants contained in the amended and restated revolving credit facility and the Casden Loan require us to maintain a ratio of debt to gross asset value of no more than 0.55 to 1.0, and an interest coverage ratio of 2.25 to 1.0. In addition, the amended and restated revolving credit facility and the Casden Loan limit us from distributing more than 80% of our Funds From Operations over any 12-month period (or such amounts as may be necessary for us to maintain our status as a REIT). Finally, the fixed charge coverage ratio requirement for the quarter ended June30, 2002 through February13, 2003 (at which time the coverage ratios were further amended as indicated above) was 1.60:1. As of December31, 2002, we were in compliance with all financial covenant requirements.
Future Capital Needs We expect to fund any future acquisitions, redevelopment and capital improvements principally with proceeds from property sales, short-term borrowings and operating cash flows. As of December31, 2002, we had 10 properties with 3,678 units under redevelopment having an estimated total investment (fair market value prior to redevelopment plus new redevelopment spending) of $601million, of which approximately $34million remains to be spent. Our share of the estimated total investment is $501million of which approximately $21million remains to be spent.
During 2003, we have:  $178.9million of scheduled maturities of property debt that we expect to refinance;  $134.6million of scheduled principal amortization payments on property debt that we expect to pay with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales; and  $406.0million of short-term debt ($291.0million on the credit facility and $115.0million on the Casden Loan) that we expect to repay a portion of with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales.
Capital Expenditures For the year ended December31, 2002, we spent a total of $82.9million and $8.0million on Capital Replacements (expenditures required to maintain the related asset) and on Capital Enhancements (expenditures that add a new feature or revenue source at a property), respectively.
Capital Replacements spending has increased for two primary reasons: a general increase in spending to maintain our assets; and an increase in capitalized costs. In addition to Capital Replacements, we monitor Capital Enhancements, which we distinguish from Capital Replacements. Capital Enhancements are costs incurred to add additional rental square footage, a new building or a new revenue producing feature. For example, replacement of existing kitchen appliances is a Capital Replacement, however, if the same replacements are done in connection with an extensive remodeling project then they are characterized as a Capital Enhancement. Because the distinction between Capital Replacements and Capital Enhancements is not consistently applied across REITs and because there is a risk of partial substitution between Capital Replacements and Capital Enhancements, we monitor and report both Capital Replacements and Capital Enhancements and deduct both in our calculation of AFFO.
39 The table below details our actual spending on Capital Replacements and Capital Enhancements based on a per unit and total dollar basis (based on approximately 173,000 units) for the year ended December31, 2002 and reconciles it to our 2002 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Useful Life in Yrs Capital Replacements Actual Cost Per Unit Capital Enhancements Actual Cost Per Unit Total CR/CE Annual Cost Per Unit Capital Replacements Actual Cost Capital Enhancements Actual Cost Total CR/CE Annual Cost (in thousands) (in thousands) (in thousands) Carpets 5 $ 108 $  $ 108 $ 18,795 $ 11 $ 18,806 Flooring 5 26  26 4,509 77 4,586 Appliances 5 33 3 36 5,731 447 6,178 Blinds/shades 5 6  6 961 4 965 Furnace/air 5 37 1 38 6,423 112 6,535 Hot water heaters 5 10  10 1,646 21 1,667 Kitchen/bath 5 13 1 14 2,207 90 2,297 Exterior painting 5 13 1 14 2,338 186 2,524 Landscaping 5 17 1 18 2,987 243 3,230 Pool/exercise facilities 5 15 1 16 2,519 221 2,740 Computers, miscellaneous 5 17  17 2,865  2,865 Roofs 15 10  10 1,716  1,716 Parking lot 15 10  10 1,775 87 1,862 Building (electrical, elevator, plumbing) 15 74 5 79 12,899 887 13,786 Submetering 15  27 27  4,602 4,602 Capitalized payroll 5 89 6 95 15,511 984 16,495 Total Company's share $ 478 $ 46 $ 524 $ 82,882 $ 7,972 $ 90,854 Plus minority partners' share of consolidated spending 10,667 379 11,046 Less our share of unconsolidated spending (11,168 ) (823 ) (11,991 ) Total spending per Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows $ 82,381 $ 7,528 $ 89,909 In addition, we capitalized approximately $8.8million of our share of indirect costs related to these activities for the year ended December31, 2002, increasing our share of Capital Replacement ($90.4million) and Capital Enhancement ($9.2million) spending to $99.6million. We funded these expenditures with cash provided by operating activities, working capital reserves, and borrowings under our credit facility.
For the year ended December31, 2002, we spent a total of $170.9million for initial capital expenditures, or ICE, (expenditures at a property that have been identified, at the time the property is acquired, as expenditures to be incurred within one year of the acquisition, which in this period relates primarily to the properties acquired in the Casden Merger) and redevelopment (expenditures that substantially upgrade the property). The following table reconciles our share of those expenditures to our 2002 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (in millions): Year Ended December31, 2002 ICE Redevelopment Total Conventional Assets $ 29.5 $ 131.0 $ 160.5 Affordable Assets 6.6 3.8 10.4 Total Company's share 36.1 134.8 170.9 Plus minority partners' share of consolidated spending 1.6 20.5 22.1 Less our share of unconsolidated spending (3.0 ) (9.8 ) (12.8 ) Total ICE and redevelopment spending per Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows $ 34.7 $ 145.5 $ 180.2 In addition, we capitalized approximately $15.4million of our share of direct and indirect costs related to these activities for the year ended December31, 2002, increasing our share of ICE and redevelopment spending to $186.3million. We funded these expenditures with cash provided by operating activities, working capital reserves, and borrowings under our credit facility.
40 During 2001 and 2002, we refined our process for identifying and capitalizing certain indirect costs, which include the implementation of a detailed time reporting system to measure such activities more accurately. As a result of the refined process, we capitalized approximately $40.7million of our share of indirect costs for the year ended December31, 2002, compared to approximately $48.1million for the year ended December31, 2001, for a reduction of approximately $7.4million.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We own general and limited partner interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, which interests were acquired through acquisitions, direct purchases and separate offers to other limited partners. Our total ownership interests in these unconsolidated real estate partnerships range from 1% to 55%. However, based on the provisions of the related partnership agreements, which grant varying degrees of control, we are not deemed to have control of these partnerships sufficient to require or permit consolidation for accounting purposes. There are no lines of credit, side agreements, financial guarantees, or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between us and our unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Accordingly, our maximum risk of loss related to these unconsolidated real estate partnerships is limited to the aggregate carrying amount of our investment in the unconsolidated real estate partnerships and any outstanding notes receivable as reported in our consolidated financial statements. See Note5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on our unconsolidated real estate partnerships.
Contractual Obligations This table summarizes information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report regarding contractual obligations and commitments (amounts in thousands): 2003 2004 and 2005 2006 and 2007 2008 and thereafter Total Scheduled long-term debt maturities $ 313,514 $ 536,355 $ 906,461 $ 4,071,386 $ 5,827,716 Secured credit facilities  115,000   115,000 Leases 5,549 9,311 7,583  22,443 Development fee payments (1) 10,000 20,000 2,500  32,500 Total $ 329,063 $ 680,666 $ 916,544 $ 4,071,386 $ 5,997,659 (1) The development fee payments above were established in connection with the Casden Merger and our commitment as it relates to the Casden Development Company, LLC. We agreed to pay $2.5million per quarter for five years up to an aggregate amount of $50.0million to Casden Development Company, LLC as a retainer on account for redevelopment services. Additionally, we have committed to invest up to $50million for a 20% limited liability company interest in Casden Properties, LLC, a newly formed company controlled by third parties. As of December31, 2002, we had invested $11.7million (see Note4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this Annual Report for additional information).
41 ITEM 7a.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates. We are not subject to any foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk, or any other material market rate or price risks. We use predominantly long-term, fixed-rate and self-amortizing non-recourse mortgage debt in order to avoid the refunding and repricing risks of short-term borrowings. We use short-term debt financing and working capital primarily to fund short-term uses and acquisitions and generally expect to refinance such borrowings with cash from operating activities, property sales proceeds or long-term debt financings.
We had $1,411.2million of variable rate debt outstanding at December31, 2002, which represented 22.6% of our total outstanding debt. Of the total variable debt, the major components were floating rate tax-exempt bond financing ($786.2million), floating rate secured notes ($219.0million), the Casden Loan ($115.0million), and the credit facility ($291.0million). Based on this level of debt, an increase in interest rates of 1% would result in our income and cash flows being reduced by $14.1million on an annual basis. Historically, changes in tax-exempt interest rates have been at a ratio less than 1:1 with changes in taxable interest rates. Variable rate tax-exempt bond financing is benchmarked against the Bond Market Association Municipal Swap Index (the "BMA Index"). Since 1981, the BMA Index has averaged 54.2% of the 10-year Treasury Yield. If this relationship continues and based on our level of tax-exempt debt, an increase of 1% in taxable interest rates would result in our income and cash flows being reduced by $10.5million on an annual basis. At December31, 2002, the Company had $4,822.5million of fixed-rate debt outstanding. As of December31, 2001, based on our level of variable debt of $925.1million, an increase in interest rates of 1% would have resulted in our income and cash flows being reduced by $9.3million on an annual basis. The year ended December31, 2002 had an increased potential reduction of $4.8million as compared to the year ended December31, 2001 due to our increased variable debt balance in 2002, as a result of our acquisitions and newly consolidated properties.
As of December31, 2002, the scheduled principal amortization and maturity payments for our consolidated secured notes payable and consolidated secured tax-exempt bonds were as follows (dollars in thousands): Amortization Maturities Total Percentage 2003 $ 134,575 $ 178,939 $ 313,514 5.4 % 2004 145,628 69,562 215,190 3.7 % 2005 153,664 167,501 321,165 5.5 % 2006 157,455 384,860 542,315 9.3 % 2007 164,289 199,857 364,146 6.2 % Thereafter 4,071,386 69.9 % $ 5,827,716 100.0 % The estimated aggregate fair value of our cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables and short-term secured debt as of December31, 2002 approximate their carrying value due to their relatively short-term nature. Management further believes that the fair value of our variable rate secured tax-exempt bond debt and variable rate secured long-term debt approximate their carrying values. The fair value for our fixed-rate debt agreements were estimated based on the quoted market rate for the same or similar issues. The carrying amount of our fixed-rate debt at December31, 2002 was $4.8billion compared to the computed fair value of $5.5billion (see Note3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report).

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Apartment Investment and Management Company at December31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.144, " Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ," as of January1, 2002. As a result, the accompanying consolidated financial statements for 2001 and 2000, referred to above, have been restated to conform to the presentation adopted in 2002 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

F-7 APARTMENT INVESTMENT AND MANAGEMENT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2002 NOTE 1  Organization Apartment Investment and Management Company ("AIMCO" or the "Company") is a Maryland corporation incorporated on January10, 1994. AIMCO is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, engaged in the acquisition, ownership, management and redevelopment of apartment properties. As of December31, 2002, AIMCO owned or managed a portfolio of 1,788 apartment properties (individually a "property" and collectively the "properties") containing 318,152 apartment units located in 47 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Based on apartment unit data compiled by the National Multi Housing Council, as of December31, 2002, the Company was the largest owner and operator of apartment properties in the United States. AIMCO serves approximately one million residents per year.
As of December31, 2002, AIMCO:  owned a controlling equity interest in 187,506 apartment units in 728 properties (which the Company refers to as "consolidated");  owned a non-controlling equity interest in 73,924 apartment units in 511 properties (which the Company refers to as "unconsolidated"), of which 64,937 apartment units were managed by the Company; and  provided services or managed, for third party owners, 56,722 apartment units in 549 properties, primarily pursuant to long-term agreements (includes 45,187 apartment units in 448 properties that are asset managed only, and not also property managed).
AIMCO is the sole general partner of, and through its wholly owned subsidiaries, AIMCO-GP,Inc. and AIMCO-LP,Inc., owns a majority interest in AIMCO Properties, L.P. (the "AIMCO Operating Partnership"). As of December31, 2002, AIMCO held an approximate 89% ownership interest in the AIMCO Operating Partnership. AIMCO conducts substantially all of its business and owns substantially all of its assets through the AIMCO Operating Partnership. Interests in the AIMCO Operating Partnership that are held by limited partners other than AIMCO are referred to as "OP Units." OP Units include common OP Units, Partnership Preferred Units ("preferred OP Units") and High Performance Partnership Units ("High Performance Units"). The AIMCO Operating Partnership's income is allocated to holders of common OP Units based on the weighted number of common OP Units outstanding during the period. The AIMCO Operating Partnership records the issuance of common OP Units and the assets acquired in purchase transactions based on the market price of the Company's ClassA Common Stock at the date of execution of the purchase contract. The holders of the common OP Units receive distributions, prorated from the date of issuance, in an amount equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of ClassA Common Stock. After holding the common or preferred OP Units for one year, the limited partners generally have the right to redeem their common or preferred OP Units for cash. Notwithstanding that right, the AIMCO Operating Partnership may elect to cause AIMCO to acquire some or all of the common or preferred OP Units tendered for redemption in exchange for shares of ClassA Common Stock in lieu of cash. During 2002, 2001 and 2000, the weighted average ownership interest in the AIMCO Operating Partnership held by the common OP Unit holders was 13%, 13%, and 9%, respectively. Preferred OP Units entitle the holders thereof to a preference with respect to distributions or upon liquidation (see Note14). See Note20 for the discussion on High Performance Units.
At December31, 2002, 93,769,996 shares of AIMCO's ClassA Common Stock (the "Common Stock") were outstanding. At December31, 2002, the AIMCO Operating Partnership had 12,061,259 common OP Units and equivalents outstanding. At December31, 2002, a combined total of 105,831,255 shares of Common Stock and OP Units were outstanding (excluding preferred OP Units).
F-8 NOTE 2  Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AIMCO, the AIMCO Operating Partnership, majority owned subsidiaries and consolidated real estate partnerships. Effective January1, 2001, as a result of the Company acquiring all of the voting stock of certain previously unconsolidated subsidiaries, the Company began consolidating the results of operations of these subsidiaries (see Note6). As used herein, and except where the context otherwise requires, "partnership" refers to a limited partnership or a limited liability company and "partner" refers to a limited partner in a limited partnership or a member in a limited liability company. Interests held in consolidated real estate partnerships by limited partners other than the Company are reflected as minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The assets of consolidated real estate partnerships owned or controlled by AIMCO or the AIMCO Operating Partnership generally are not available to pay creditors of AIMCO or the AIMCO Operating Partnership.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Real estate and other long-lived assets are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation, unless considered impaired. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may be impaired, the Company will make an assessment of its recoverability by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, the Company would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. As of December31, 2002, management believes that no impairments exist based on periodic reviews. No impairment losses were recognized for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000.
Real Estate and Depreciation Direct costs associated with the acquisition of ownership or control of properties are capitalized as a cost of the assets acquired, and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. "Initial Capital Expenditures" or "ICE" are those costs considered necessary by the Company in its investment decision to correct deferred maintenance or improve a property. "Capital Enhancements" are costs incurred that add a material new feature or increase the revenue potential of a property. ICE and Capital Enhancement costs are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, generally 5-15years.
Expenditures in excess of $250 that maintain an existing asset, which has a useful life of more than one year are capitalized as "Capital Replacement" expenditures and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. Expenditures for ordinary repairs, maintenance and apartment turnover costs are expensed as incurred.
In 2001, the Company completed a comprehensive review of its real estate related depreciation including property-by-property analyses of more than 500 properties producing more than 90% of the Company's Free Cash Flow from real estate. As a result of this review, the Company has changed its estimate of the remaining useful lives for its real estate assets. Effective July1, 2001 for certain assets and October1, 2001 for the majority of the portfolio, the Company extended the useful lives of the assets from a weighted average composite life of 25years, to a weighted average composite life of 30years. This change increased net income by approximately $74million, or $0.86 per diluted share and $31million, or $0.42 per diluted share for 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company believes the change reflects the remaining useful lives of the assets and is consistent with prevailing industry practice.
Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method based on a 13 to 40year life for buildings and improvements and five years for furniture, fixtures and equipment.
Redevelopment and Other Capital Expenditure Activities The Company capitalizes direct and indirect costs (including interest, real estate taxes and other costs) in connection with the redevelopment, ICE, Capital Enhancement and Capital Replacement needs of its owned or controlled properties. Indirect costs that do not relate to the above activities, including general and administrative expenses are charged to expense as F-9 incurred. Interest and other costs of $18.0million and $40.7million, $16.8million and $48.1million, and $10.1million and $15.6million were capitalized for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Capitalized costs are included in redevelopment, ICE, and Capital Replacement and Capital Enhancement spending and are reflected in associated returns from these related assets.
Cash Equivalents The Company considers highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Restricted Cash Restricted cash includes capital replacement reserves, completion repair reserves, bond sinking fund amounts and tax and insurance impound accounts held by lenders.
Deferred Costs Deferred financing fees and costs incurred in obtaining financing are capitalized and amortized over the terms of the related loan agreements and are charged to interest expense.
Deferred leasing commissions and concessions incurred in connection with leasing efforts are capitalized and amortized over the terms of the related lease and are charged to property operating expense.
Notes Receivable Primarily From Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships and Related Interest Income and Provision for Losses Notes receivable primarily from unconsolidated real estate partnerships are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and consist substantially of subordinated notes receivable (where the Company is the general partner and issuer), the ultimate repayment of which is subject to a number of variables, including the performance and value of the underlying real estate property and the ultimate timing of such repayments. The notes receivable were either extended by the Company and are carried at the face amount plus accrued interest ("par value notes") or were made by predecessors whose positions have been acquired at a discount and are carried at the acquisition amount using the cost recovery method ("discounted notes"). Under the cost recovery method, the discounted notes are carried at the acquisition amount, less subsequent cash collections, until such time as collectibility of principal and interest is probable and the timing and amounts are estimable. The carrying amounts of notes receivable approximate their fair value in consideration of interest rates, market conditions and other qualitative factors (see Note7).
The Company assesses the collectibility of each note on a periodic basis through a review of the collateral, the property operations, the value of the underlying real estate property and the borrower's ability to repay the loan. Loan losses on notes receivable are charged to expense and an allowance account is established when the Company believes the principal balance will not be fully recovered.
Income on the par value notes receivable is recorded as earned in accordance with the terms of the related loan agreements. The Company recognizes interest income earned from its investments in discounted notes receivable based upon whether the collectibility of such amounts is both probable and estimable. The accrual of interest on either par value or discounted notes is discontinued when, in the opinion of the Company, impairment has occurred in the value of the collateral property securing the loan. Income on nonaccrual loans, or loans that are otherwise not performing in accordance with their terms, is recorded on a cost recovery basis. Interest income is ultimately collected in cash or through foreclosure of the property securing the note or through obtaining an additional equity interest in the partnership that owns the property.
Based upon closed or pending transactions (which include sales, refinancings, foreclosures and rights offerings), the Company has determined that certain discounted notes are collectible for amounts greater than their carrying value. Accordingly, the Company is recognizing accretion income on certain discounted notes on a prospective basis over the estimated remaining life of the loans, as equal to the difference between the carrying value of the discounted notes and the estimated collectible value.
F-10 Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships The Company owns general and limited partnership interests in real estate partnerships that own apartment properties. Investments in real estate partnerships in which the Company has significant influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equity method. Under the equity method, the Company's pro-rata share of the earnings or losses of the entity for the periods being presented is included in equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated real estate partnerships (see Note5).
Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries Effective January1, 2001, the Company acquired control and began consolidating its previously unconsolidated subsidiaries (see Note6). Prior to this date, the Company had significant influence but did not have control. Accordingly, such investments were accounted for under the equity method. Under the equity method, the Company's pro-rata share of the losses of the entity for the period being presented was included in equity in losses from unconsolidated subsidiaries. As a result of this consolidation in 2001, the results of operations of the investment management business increased substantially in 2001 over 2000.
Other Assets Included in other assets is goodwill associated with the purchase of property management businesses that had previously been amortized on a straight-line basis over twenty years. Also included in other assets are other intangible assets for purchased management contracts that are amortized on a straight-line basis over terms ranging from five to twenty years. In July2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS142"). SFAS142 eliminates amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and requires the Company to perform impairment tests at least annually on all goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. The Company adopted the requirements of SFAS142 beginning January1, 2002, and has completed the goodwill impairment testing required by SFAS142 and did not identify any impairments. See Note19 for the impact of the adoption of the non-amortization provision of SFAS142 on net income and income from continuing operations and earnings per share for the year ended December31, 2002.
Minority Interest in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships Interests held in consolidated real estate partnerships by limited partners other than the Company are reflected as minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships. Minority interest in real estate partnerships represents the minority partners' share of the underlying net assets of the Company's consolidated real estate partnerships. When these consolidated real estate partnerships make cash distributions in excess of net income, the Company, as the majority partner, records a charge equal to the minority partners' excess of distributions over net income when the partnership has deficit equity, even though the Company does not suffer any economic effect, cost or risk. This charge is classified in the consolidated statements of income as distributions to minority partners in excess of income. Losses are allocated to minority partners until such time as such losses exceed the minority interest basis, in which case the Company recognizes 100% of the losses in operating earnings, even though the Company does not suffer any economic effect, cost or risk. With regard to such consolidated real estate partnerships, approximately $7.0million in losses related to the minority interest ownership were charged to operations for the year ended December31, 2002, $2.0million for the year ended December31, 2001 and no losses were charged to operations for the year ended December31, 2000.
Revenue Recognition The Company's properties have operating leases with apartment residents with terms generally of twelve months or less. Rental revenue related to these leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from residents in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements." In accordance with the Company's standard lease terms, rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis. Any concessions given at the inception of the lease are amortized over the life of the lease. Property management and asset management fees are recognized when earned.
Gain (Loss) on Dispositions of Real Estate and Discontinued Operations As a result of the Company's adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.144, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of ("SFAS144") effective January 1, 2002, the Company now reports assets held for sale (as defined by SFAS144) and assets sold in the current period as discontinued operations. As a result, gain (loss) on dispositions of real estate does not include any gain or loss associated with the disposal of consolidated properties that were classified as discontinued operations during 2002. For the year ended December31, 2002, gain (loss) on dispositions of real estate only included gain or loss on disposals of real estate held by unconsolidated real estate partnerships and casualty gain or loss on all properties. For the periods ended December31, 2001 and 2000, gain (loss) on dispositions of real estate included gain or loss associated with all properties.
For the year ended December 31, 2002, discontinued operations included the operations of the properties sold and classified as held for sale in 2002 and the associated gain (loss) on the disposition of the properties. For the year ended December31, 2001 and 2000, discontinued operations included the 2001 and 2000 operations of the properties sold and classified as held for sale in 2002, while no gains or losses on assets sold in 2001 or 2000 were included.
F-11 Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are generally comprised of amounts receivable from residents and non-affiliated real estate partnerships for which the Company provides property management and other services. The Company evaluates all accounts receivable from residents and an allowance is established for amounts greater than 30days past due. The accounts receivable relating to residents are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $4.1million and $1.9million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company evaluates all accounts receivable from non-affiliated real estate partnerships and an allowance is established for amounts greater than 120days past due. The accounts receivable relating to non-affiliated real estate partnerships are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $3.9million and $1.6million in 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts from Affiliates Accounts receivable from affiliates are generally comprised of amounts receivable from real estate partnerships in which the Company has an ownership interest related to property management and other services provided to the real estate partnerships. The Company evaluates all accounts receivable balances from affiliates on a periodic basis, and an allowance is established for the amounts deemed to be uncollectible. The accounts receivable from affiliates are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $4.1million and $5.6million in 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Company predominately uses long-term, fixed-rate and self-amortizing non-recourse debt in order to avoid, among other things, risk related to fluctuating interest rates. Where the Company does use variable-rate debt, occasionally the Company enters into short-term economic hedges, such as interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements, to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The interest rate swap agreements are generally utilized by the Company to modify the Company's exposure to interest rate risk by converting the variable-rate debt to a fixed rate. The interest rate cap agreements utilized by the Company effectively limit the Company's exposure to interest rate risk by providing a ceiling on the underlying variable rate debt. Normally, the interest rate caps are embedded within the original debt contract and are considered clearly and closely related to the debt contract and, therefore, are not measured as separate derivative instruments. Free standing interest rate exchange agreements were not material.
Insurance Management believes that the Company's insurance coverages insure its properties adequately against the risk of loss attributable to fire, earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood and other perils. AIMCO AssuranceLtd., a Bermuda domiciled insurer wholly owned by the Company, has a reinsurance contract with a third party provider to cover 100% of the first $1million loss from any casualty related to the conventional properties. The affordable properties are insured for the first $1million through an independent third party carrier. For the policy year ending February28, 2003, the Company was insured for any casualty loss in excess of $1million, up to $230million, by a combination of several "excess" insurance providers, all of which were at least A-rated. For the policy year ending February28, 2003, the Company also has retained an annual aggregate exposure of $4million above the first $1million per occurrence. As a result of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, the Company is currently evaluating the price of offers, mandated by the legislation, to purchase terrorism insurance. In addition to the above, the Company has self-insured retentions in workers' compensation liability coverage. Losses are accrued based upon the Company's estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on Company experience and are recorded in the operations of the investment management business.
Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for Federal income tax purposes, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences reverse.
AIMCO has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"), as defined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As a REIT, AIMCO generally will not be subject to United States Federal income taxes at the corporate level on its net income that is distributed to its stockholders if it distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders. REITs are also subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements. If AIMCO fails to F-12 qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, its taxable income will be subject to United States Federal income tax at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax). Even if AIMCO qualifies as a REIT, it may be subject to certain state and local income taxes and to United States Federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income.
Earnings and profits, which determine the taxability of dividends to stockholders, differ from net income reported for financial reporting purposes principally due to differences for United States Federal tax purposes in the estimated useful lives and methods used to compute depreciation and the carrying value (basis) of the investments in properties.
The following table reconciles the Company's net income to REIT taxable income for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 (in thousands): 2002 2001 2000 Net income $ 169,046 $ 107,352 $ 99,178 Elimination of earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries 9,725 3,830 (3,666 ) Depreciation and amortization expense not deductible for tax (23,763 ) 100,908 89,885 Gain on disposition of real estate property 62,146 24,709 42,645 Interest income, not currently taxable (18,169 ) (13,308 ) (12,987 ) Depreciation timing differences on real estate 33,777 20,701 7,007 Dividends on officer stock, not deductible for tax 2,787 2,335 2,496 Provision for loan losses 6,107   Limited partner deficit allocations, not deductible for tax 24,551 46,083 21,992 Transaction and project costs, deductible for tax 10,525 (5,315 ) (2,730 ) REIT taxable income $ 276,732 $ 287,295 $ 243,820 For income tax purposes, distributions paid to holders of Common Stock consist of ordinary income, capital gains, return of capital or a combination thereof. For the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, distributions paid per share were taxable as follows: 2002 2001 2000 Amount Percentage Amount Percentage Amount Percentage Ordinary income $ 2.00 61% $ 2.37 76% $ 1.84 66% Return of capital 0.66 20%     Capital gains 0.23 7% 0.19 6% 0.32 11% Unrecaptured Sec.1250 gain 0.39 12% 0.56 18% 0.64 23% $ 3.28 100% $ 3.12 100% $ 2.80 100% Earnings Per Share Earnings per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and dilutive convertible securities outstanding during the period (see Note18).
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The aggregate fair value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables and short-term secured debt as of December31, 2002 approximates their carrying value due to their relatively short-term nature. Management further believes that the fair value of the Company's variable rate secured tax-exempt bond debt and secured long-term debt approximate their carrying value. For the fixed rate secured tax-exempt bond debt and secured long-term debt, fair values have been based on estimates using present value techniques (see Note3). These techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent market quotes and, in many cases, may not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument.
F-13 Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially could subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of notes receivable primarily from unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes receivable primarily from unconsolidated real estate partnerships are limited due to the large number of partnerships comprising the Company's partnership base, the geographic diversity of the underlying properties, and the number of partnership distributions.
Use of Estimates The preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts included in the financial statements and accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications Certain items included in the 2001 and 2000 financial statements amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation.
NOTE 3  Fair Value of Financial Instruments The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments.
Cash and cash equivalents The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents reported in the balance sheet for cash and short-term investments classified as cash equivalents approximate those assets' fair value.
Bonds receivable and retained residual interest The carrying amounts of bonds receivable and retained residual interests included in other assets in the balance sheet approximate those assets' fair values. The Company generally estimates fair value of the bonds receivable and the retained residual interests based on the present value of future expected cash flows of the bonds, which are derived from the underlying properties' operations. The fair value of both the bonds receivable and the retained residual interests, based on the underlying properties that secure the bonds, are estimated using management's best estimates of the key assumptions  capitalization rates and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved.
Mortgages payable The fair value of the Company's borrowings under its variable rate agreements approximate their carrying value. The fair value for the Company's fixed-rate debt agreements is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues. These techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent market quotes and, in many cases, may not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument. The carrying amount of accrued interest approximates fair value. These balances do not include liabilities related to assets classified as held for sale as these are considered short-term liabilities and their carrying values are considered to approximate their fair values.
F-14 The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's financial instruments at December31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows (in thousands): 2002 Asset (Liability) 2001 Asset (Liability) Financial Instrument Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 324,437 $ 324,437 $ 218,223 $ 218,223 Bonds receivable and retained residual interest   28,634 28,634 Mortgages payable  fixed rate (4,822,537 ) (5,476,632 ) (3,762,312 ) (4,183,543 ) NOTE 4  Mergers and Acquisitions Casden Merger On March11, 2002, the Company completed the acquisition of Casden PropertiesInc. ("Casden") pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of December3, 2001, by and among AIMCO, Casden and XYZ Holdings LLC. The acquisition of Casden included the merger of Casden into AIMCO, and the merger of a subsidiary of AIMCO into another REIT affiliated with Casden (collectively, the "Casden Merger"). The approximately $1.1billion acquisition is comprised of the following:  17 properties comprised of 4,975 conventional apartment units located in Southern California;  99 properties comprised of 11,027 affordable apartment units located in 25 states; and  National Partnership Investments Corp. ("NAPICO"), a subsidiary of Casden, which as general and/or limited partner of numerous limited partnerships has interests in more than 400 properties with more than 41,000 units.
In addition, as part of the Casden Merger, AIMCO has committed to do the following:  purchase two properties currently under development that will have a total of 1,731 units, for minimum deferred consideration of $619million, which is payable upon satisfactory completion and attainment of 60% occupancy (on November27, 2002, AIMCO purchased one phase of one of the properties comprising 250 units for $55.5million);  provide a stand-by facility of $70million in debt financing associated with the two properties under development (as of December31, 2002, no funds have been drawn on this stand-by facility); and  invest up to $50million for a 20% limited liability company interest in Casden Properties, LLC, a newly formed company controlled by third parties. As of December31, 2002, the Company had invested $11.7million. Casden Properties, LLC acts as general contractor for the entity that is developing the two properties AIMCO has committed to purchase. In addition, Casden Properties, LLC intends to pursue new development opportunities in Southern California and other markets. AIMCO will have an option, but not an obligation to purchase, at completion, all multifamily rental projects developed by Casden Properties, LLC.
F-15 AIMCO paid approximately $1.1billion, which included an earnout of $15million as a result of property performance for the period ended December31, 2001. The Company issued 3.508million shares of Common Stock and 882,784 common OP Units (valued at $164.9million and $41.5million, respectively, based on $47 per share/unit), paid approximately $198million in cash and acquired title subject to existing mortgage indebtedness of approximately $685million, and assumed short-term indebtedness of approximately $48million. The Company also incurred approximately $15million in transaction costs comprised largely of professional fees, which included legal, accounting, tax and acquisition due diligence. This transaction was accounted for as a purchase, and as a result, the results of operations were included in the consolidated statements of income from the date of acquisition. The aggregate purchase price of $1.1billion (including the Company's transaction costs of $15.0million) was recorded as follows (in thousands): Real Estate $ 1,083,825 Cash and cash equivalents 72,227 Investment in unconsolidated real estate partnerships 39,394 Other assets 30,136 Secured tax-exempt bond financing 219,102 Secured notes payable 465,559 Short-term debt 246,022 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 85,100 Other liabilities 3,426 Minority interest in AIMCO Operating Partnership 41,491 Stockholders' equity 164,882 The allocation of the purchase price of Casden is based upon preliminary estimates and is subject to final resolution of certain contingent liabilities and other evaluations of fair value. Therefore, the allocations reflected above may differ from the amounts ultimately determined.
In connection with the Casden Merger, the Company borrowed $287million from Lehman Commercial PaperInc. and other participating lenders, pursuant to a term loan (the "Casden Loan") to pay the cash required to complete the Casden Merger. During 2002, the Company repaid approximately 60% of the Casden Loan principally with portions of the proceeds from the public offering of Common Stock, the offering of ClassR Cumulative Preferred Stock, property sales and other net cash flow from operations. The outstanding balance on the Casden Loan was $115million at December31, 2002.
New England Properties Acquisition On August29, 2002, the Company completed the acquisition of certain New England area properties (the "New England Properties Acquisition") pursuant to a definitive agreement dated as of July10, 2002, by and among the AIMCO Operating Partnership, Thomas J. Flatley and others. In this acquisition, the Company acquired 11 conventional garden and mid-rise apartment properties located primarily in the greater Boston, Massachusetts area. These properties include 4,323 units located on approximately 553 acres in the aggregate. The total cost of the acquisition included a purchase price of $500million for the properties, $2.5million in transaction costs and $34.2million of initial capital expenditures (of which $28million will be spent to complete a kitchen and bath program and $6.2million will be spent to address other identified property needs). The acquisition was funded through a combination of non-recourse property debt of $308.7million in long-term, fixed rate, fully amortizing notes with an average interest rate of 5.69%; and $200million from the Company's credit facility. The Company expects to repay the facility with net cash flow from operations and proceeds from property sales. The Company accounted for this transaction as a purchase, and as a result, the results of operations were included in the consolidated statements of income from the date of acquisition. The current allocation of the purchase price of the New England Properties Acquisition is based upon preliminary estimates and is subject to final resolution of certain contingent liabilities and other evaluations of fair value.
In connection with the New England Properties Acquisition, the Company entered into an exchange agreement with a third party intermediary on 10 of the 11 properties. This agreement was for a maximum term of 180days and allowed the Company to pursue favorable tax treatment on other properties sold by the Company within this period. During this 180-day period, that ended on February25, 2003, the third party intermediary was the legal owner, although the Company retained all of the economic benefits and risks associated with these properties and had indemnified the third party intermediary. As of the expiration of the 180-day period, the Company has taken legal ownership of all of these properties.
F-16 Oxford Tax Exempt Fund On March26, 2001, the Company completed a merger pursuant to an agreement entered into on November29, 2000 between AIMCO and Oxford Tax Exempt Fund II Limited Partnership ("OTEF"), for a total purchase price of $270million, comprised of $100million in ClassP Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock (the "ClassP Preferred Stock"), $106million in Common Stock issued at $48.46 per share (2.185million shares of Common Stock), $17million in cash, and $47million in assumed liabilities. OTEF merged with a subsidiary of the AIMCO Operating Partnership. In connection with the Company's acquisition of interests in properties (the "Oxford properties") from affiliates of Oxford Realty Financial Group,Inc., on September20, 2000, the Company had acquired interests in OTEF's managing general partner and OTEF's associate general partner. OTEF was a publicly traded master limited partnership that invested primarily in tax-exempt bonds issued to finance properties owned by affiliates of OTEF, including the Oxford properties. In the merger, each beneficial interest was converted into the right to receive 0.299 shares of Common Stock and 0.547 shares of AIMCO's ClassP Preferred Stock. In addition, the beneficial interest holders received a special distribution of $50million, or $6.21 per beneficial interest. This transaction was accounted for as a purchase, and as a result, the results of operations were included in the consolidated statement of income from the date of acquisition. Subsequent to the merger, the Company sold certain of the tax-exempt bond receivables, with a carrying value of $246.8million, to an unrelated third party at a discount to their face amount and retained a residual interest in those bonds. The fair value of the Company's retained residual interests was based on the future cash flows from the bonds. In 2001, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $253.3million and recognized gains of $26.1million on the sale of these tax-exempt bonds, which included $19.6million of retained residual interests (see Note26). Approximately $23million of tax-exempt bonds were not sold in 2001, of such amount; (i)$14million were eliminated in consolidation and (ii)$9.0million remained held by the Company and were classified with other assets. During 2002, in connection with the sale of certain assets, as well as additional proceeds received from the refinancing of the tax-exempt bonds of the underlying properties, the Company's retained residual interests were collected.
Oxford Properties On September20, 2000, the Company acquired all of the stock and other interests of the Oxford entities that were held by six executive officers and directors of the Oxford entities. The Oxford properties, which are owned by 166 separate partnerships, are 167 apartment communities including 36,949 units, located in 18 states. This transaction was accounted for as a purchase, and as a result, the results of operations were included in the consolidated statements of income from the date of acquisition. The purchase price of $1,189million was comprised of $266million in cash, $861million of assumed liabilities and transaction costs and $62million in common OP Units valued at $45 per unit. During 2001, the allocation of the purchase price was finalized, which resulted in changes to amounts included in the prior year financial statements.
Limited Partnership Acquisitions During 2002 and 2001, the Company acquired limited partnership interests in 323 partnerships and 261 partnerships, respectively, in which affiliates of the Company served as a general partner. During 2002, the Company paid approximately $31.0million, of which $27.7million was in cash and the remainder in OP Units in connection with such tender offers, a portion of which related to increasing the ownership interest in consolidated real estate partnerships. During 2001, the Company paid approximately $178.0million, of which $135.6million was in cash and the remainder in OP Units in connection with such tender offers.
NOTE 5  Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships The Company owned general and limited partner interests in approximately 445 unconsolidated real estate partnerships at December31, 2002, approximately 487 unconsolidated real estate partnerships at December31, 2001 and approximately 625 unconsolidated real estate partnerships at December31, 2000, respectively. The interests were acquired through acquisitions, direct purchases and separate offers to other limited partners. The Company's total ownership interests in these unconsolidated real estate partnerships range from 1% to 55%. However, based on the provisions of the partnership agreements, which grant varying degrees of control, the Company is not deemed to have control of these partnerships sufficient to require or permit consolidation for accounting purposes.
F-17 The following table provides selected combined financial information for the Company's unconsolidated real estate partnerships as of and for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 (in thousands): 2002 2001 2000 Real estate, net of accumulated depreciation $ 1,569,144 $ 1,848,659 $ 2,215,184 Total assets 1,880,982 2,212,779 2,703,753 Secured and other notes payable 1,787,756 2,854,195 3,574,971 Total liabilities 2,306,931 3,114,349 3,786,855 Partners' deficit (425,949 ) (901,570 ) (1,083,102 ) Rental and other property revenues 587,199 670,661 777,621 Property operating expenses (319,685 ) (347,309 ) (408,198 ) Income from property operations 267,514 323,352 369,423 Depreciation expense (123,489 ) (141,123 ) (140,730 ) Interest expense (176,087 ) (218,635 ) (232,995 ) Net income 27,505 82,140 135,927 The decrease in the amounts in the above table from year to year was primarily due to dispositions and the Company's purchase of controlling interests in, and resultant consolidation of, various partnerships previously accounted for under the equity method.
As a result of the Company's acquisitions of interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, the investment in these partnerships at December31, 2002 of $367.9million is approximately $450million in excess of the Company's share of the underlying historical net liabilities of the partnerships. The excess of the cost of the investments acquired over the equity in the underlying net liabilities is ascribed to the fair values of land and buildings owned by the unconsolidated real estate partnerships. The Company amortizes the excess basis related to the buildings over their estimated useful lives.
NOTE 6  Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries In prior years, in order to satisfy certain requirements of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to the Company's status as a REIT, certain assets of the Company were held through unconsolidated subsidiaries in which the AIMCO Operating Partnership held non-voting preferred stock representing a 99% economic interest and certain officers and directors of the Company held all of the voting common stock, representing a 1% economic interest. As a result of the controlling ownership interest in the unconsolidated subsidiaries being held by others, the Company accounted for its interest in the unconsolidated subsidiaries using the equity method through December31, 2000.
The REIT Modernization Act, which became effective January1, 2001, among other things, permits REITS to own taxable REIT subsidiaries. Therefore, effective January1, 2001, the Company acquired the 1% controlling ownership interest in the unconsolidated subsidiaries. As a result, the Company began consolidating these subsidiaries as of January1, 2001.
The following table provides selected combined historical financial information for the Company's unconsolidated subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December31, 2000 (in thousands): 2000 Total assets $ 700,077 Total liabilities 606,802 Stockholders' equity 70,466 Total revenues 177,088 Total expenses (173,773 ) Net income 3,135 F-18 NOTE 7  Notes Receivable Primarily From Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships The following table summarizes the Company's notes receivable primarily from unconsolidated real estate partnerships at December31, 2002 and 2001 (in thousands): Notes Receivable Primarily From Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships 2002 2001 Par value notes $ 85,641 $ 135,750 Discounted notes 89,010 107,761 Less: allowance for loan losses (5,413 )  Total $ 169,238 $ 243,511 As of December31, 2002 and 2001, the Company held, primarily through its consolidated corporate subsidiaries, $85.6million and $135.8million, respectively, of par value notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships, including accrued interest. During 2002, the Company determined that an allowance for loan losses of $4.1million was required on certain of its par value notes that had a carrying value of $10.5million at December31, 2002. No allowance for loan losses was recorded in 2001 on par value notes. Upon determining that less than the full amount of the notes was collectible, the Company ceased recording interest income on the impaired par value loans. The average recorded investment in the impaired par value loans for the year ended December31, 2002 was $7.5million. The Company believes the remaining $74.0million in par value notes receivable is collectible and, therefore, interest income on these par value notes is recognized as it is earned. Interest income from par value notes for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, totaled $26.6million, $26.0million, and $25.6million, respectively.
As of December31, 2002 and 2001, the Company held discounted notes, including accrued interest, with a carrying value of $89.0million and $107.8million, respectively. The total face value plus accrued interest of these notes was $167.2million and $270.7million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2002, the Company recorded an allowance for loan losses of $1.3million on discounted notes that had a carrying value of $9.3million. No allowance for loan losses was recorded in 2001 on discounted notes. The average recorded investment in the impaired discounted loans for the year ended December31, 2002 was $11.8million.
The discounted notes are accounted for under the cost recovery method, which results in the discounted notes being carried at the acquisition amount, less subsequent cash collections, until such time as collectibility of principal and interest is probable and the timing and amounts are estimable. Based upon closed or pending transactions (which include sales, refinancing, foreclosures and rights offering activities), the Company has determined that certain notes are collectible for amounts greater than their carrying value. Accordingly, the Company is recognizing accretion income, on a prospective basis over the estimated remaining life of the loans, equal to the difference between the carrying value of the discounted notes and the estimated collectible value. For the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company recognized accretion income of approximately $36.8million ($0.37 per basic and diluted share), $9.9million ($0.12 per basic and diluted share), and $26.4million ($0.36 per basic share and $0.35 per diluted share), respectively. These amounts are net of allocated expenses in 2002, 2001 and 2000 of $1.0million, $4.4million and $4.3million, respectively. The notes receivable generally are realizable through collection of cash or obtaining ownership of the property or of an additional equity interest in the partnership owning the property.
The activity in the allowance for loan losses in total for both par value and discounted notes for the year ended December31, 2002, is as follows: Balance at December 31, 2001 $  Provision for losses on loans 9,006 Allowance for loan losses reclassified due to foreclosure on the loan (2,602 ) Allowance for loan losses reclassified due to sale of real estate and collection of the loan (991 ) Balance at December 31, 2002 $ 5,413 The Company will continue to monitor the collectibility or impairment of each note on a periodic basis, and changes in the required allowances may occur in the future due to changes in the market environment.

NOTE 10  Term Loan The Casden Loan was used to pay the cash required to complete the Casden Merger. Transaction costs (including advisory fees) incurred on the term loan were $12.2million, which included $8.8million of advisory fees (which are included as a cost of the Casden Merger in Note4) and $3.4million of deferred loan costs. During 2002, the Company repaid approximately 60% of the Casden Loan principally with portions of the proceeds from the public offering of Common Stock, the offering of ClassR Cumulative Preferred Stock, property sales and other net cash flow from operations. The weighted average interest rate on the Casden Loan at December31, 2002 was 3.96%, and the balance outstanding was $115million.
The financial covenants contained in the Casden Loan require the Company to maintain a ratio of debt to gross asset value of no more than 0.55 to 1.0, and an interest coverage ratio of 2.25 to 1.0. In addition, the Casden Loan limits the Company from distributing more than 80% of its Funds From Operations (or such amounts as may be necessary for it to maintain its status as a REIT). On August5, 2002, the Company and its lenders amended the Casden Loan, to reduce the fixed charge coverage ratio requirement from 1.70:1 to 1.60:1, effective for the quarter ended June30, 2002 through the quarter ending June30, 2003; 1.65:1 for the quarter ending September30, 2003 through the quarter ending December31, 2003; and 1.70:1 thereafter. The Casden Loan imposes minimum net worth requirements and provides other financial covenants related to certain of AIMCO's assets and obligations. The Casden Loan is secured by a first priority pledge of the equity owned by AIMCO and certain subsidiaries of AIMCO in other subsidiaries of AIMCO and a second priority pledge of certain non-real estate assets of the Company. As of December31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenant requirements.
F-21 Subsequent to December31, 2002, additional modifications were made to the loan covenants. See Note28 for further information.
NOTE 11  Credit Facility On March11, 2002, the Company amended and restated its revolving credit facility as necessitated by the execution of the Casden Loan, in order to conform certain provisions of the loans. The commitment remained $400million, and there are ten lender participants in the facility's syndicate. The obligations under the amended and restated credit facility are secured by a first priority pledge of certain of the Company's non-real estate assets and a second priority pledge of the equity owned by AIMCO and certain subsidiaries of AIMCO in other subsidiaries of AIMCO. Borrowings under the amended and restated credit facility are available for general corporate purposes. The amended and restated credit facility matures in July2004 and can be extended once at the Company's option, for a term of one year. The annual interest rate under the credit facility is based either on LIBOR or a base rate which is the higher of Bank of America, N.A.'s reference rate or 0.5% over the federal funds rate, plus, in either case, an applicable margin. From March11, 2002 through the later of June30, 2004 or the date on which the Casden Loan is paid in full, the margin ranges between 2.05% and 2.55%, in the case of LIBOR-based loans, and between 0.55% and 1.05%, in the case of base rate loans, based upon a fixed charge coverage ratio. The weighted average interest rate at December31, 2002 was 3.97%, and the balance outstanding was $291.0million. The amount available under the amended and restated credit facility at December31, 2002 and 2001 was $109.0million (less $4.2million for outstanding letters for credit) and $186.5million (less $5.1million for outstanding letters for credit), respectively.
The financial covenants contained in the amended and restated revolving credit facility require the Company to maintain a ratio of debt to gross asset value of no more than 0.55 to 1.0, and an interest coverage ratio of 2.25 to 1.0. In addition, the amended and restated revolving credit facility limits the Company from distributing more than 80% of its Funds From Operations (or such amounts as may be necessary for it to maintain its status as a REIT). On August5, 2002, the Company and its lenders amended the amended and restated revolving credit facility, to reduce the fixed charge coverage ratio requirement from 1.70:1 to 1.60:1, effective for the quarter ended June30, 2002 through the quarter ending June30, 2003; 1.65:1 for the quarter ending September30, 2003 through the quarter ending December31, 2003; and 1.70:1 thereafter. The credit facility imposes minimum net worth requirements and provides other financial covenants related to certain of AIMCO's assets and obligations. As of December31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenant requirements.
Subsequent to December31, 2002, additional modifications were made to the loan covenants. See Note28 for further information.
NOTE 12  Commitments and Contingencies Legal In addition to the matters described below, the Company is a party to various legal actions and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which are covered by liability insurance, and none of which are expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.
Limited Partnerships In connection with the Company's acquisitions of interests in real estate partnerships, it is sometimes subject to legal actions, including allegations that such activities may involve breaches of fiduciary duties to the limited partners of such real estate partnerships or violations of the relevant partnership agreements.
The Company may incur costs in connection with the defense or settlement of such litigation. The Company believes it complies with its fiduciary obligations and relevant partnership agreements. Although the outcome of any litigation is uncertain, the Company does not expect any such legal actions to have a material adverse affect on the Company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.
Environmental Various Federal, state and local laws subject property owners or operators to liability for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances present on a property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of the hazardous substances. The presence of, or the failure F-22 to properly remedy, hazardous substances may adversely affect occupancy at affected apartment communities and the ability to sell or finance affected properties. In addition to the costs associated with investigation and remediation actions brought by governmental agencies, the presence of hazardous wastes on a property could result in claims by private plaintiffs for personal injury, disease, disability or other infirmities. Various laws also impose liability for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at the disposal or treatment facility. Anyone who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances is potentially liable under such laws. These laws often impose liability whether or not the person arranging for the disposal ever owned or operated the disposal facility. In connection with the ownership, operation and management of properties, the Company could potentially be liable for environmental liabilities or costs associated with its properties or properties it acquires or manages in the future.
There have been recent reports of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties asserting claims of personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential units. Some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. The Company has been named as a defendant in lawsuits that have alleged personal injury as a result of the presence of mold. Prior to March31, 2002, the Company generally was insured against claims arising from the presence of mold due to water intrusion. However, since March31, 2002, the Company's insurance coverage for property damage loss claims arising from the presence of mold has become more limited and generally includes only limited coverage for catastrophic property damage due to mold. In addition, since December31, 2002, the Company's insurance coverage for personal injury claims related to mold exposure has also become more limited.
The Company has implemented protocols and procedures to prevent or eliminate mold from its properties and believes that its measures will eliminate, or at least minimize, the effects that mold could have on its residents. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs or liabilities relating to claims of mold exposure or to abate mold conditions. Because the law regarding mold is unsettled and subject to change, however, the Company can make no assurance that liabilities resulting from the presence of or exposure to mold will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.
Other Legal Matters In December2001, AIMCO and certain of its affiliated partnerships that own properties voluntarily entered into an agreement with the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") pursuant to which AIMCO agreed to pay a fine of $130,000, conduct lead-based paint inspections and other testing, if necessary, on properties initially built prior to 1978, and re-issue lead-based paint disclosures to residents of such properties that have not been certified as lead-base paint free. In return, neither AIMCO nor its properties will be subject to any additional fines for inadequate disclosures prior to the execution of the agreement. The cost of the settlement, inspections and remediations incurred to date have been reserved for by the Company in connection with its portfolio acquisitions and mergers. Any remaining costs are not expected to be material.
In January2002, AIMCO and four of its affiliated partnerships were named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by the City Attorney for the City and County of San Francisco ("CCSF") in the Superior Court, County of San Francisco. The City Attorney asserts that the defendants have violated certain state and local residential housing codes, and engaged in unlawful business practices and unfair competition, in connection with four properties owned and operated by the affiliated partnerships. The City Attorney asserts civil penalties from $500 to $1,000 per day for each affected unit, as well as other statutory and equitable relief. In January2003, the Company filed a cross-complaint against CCSF, its Department of Building Inspections and certain of its employees, alleging constitutional violations arising out of its arbitrary and discriminatory application of its codes, and other tortious conduct. In February2003, CCSF and the other defendants named in the Company's cross-complaint removed the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. As a result of the removal to Federal court, the trial date previously scheduled for July7, 2003 in state court is doubtful, even if there is a remand of the case to the state court. The Company has engaged in preliminary discussions with the City Attorney to resolve the lawsuit, including a mediation session. In the event it is unable to resolve the lawsuit, the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to assert and it will vigorously defend itself against CCSF's claims, and vigorously prosecute its own claims. Although the outcome of any litigation is uncertain, the Company does not believe that the ultimate outcome will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.
F-23 National Program Services,Inc. and Vito Gruppuso (collectively "NPS") are insurance agents who in 2000 sold to the Company property insurance issued by National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, PA ("National Union"). The financial failure of NPS resulted in defaults in June2002 under two agreements by which NPS indemnified the Company from losses relating to the matters described below. As a result of such defaults, the Company faces the risk of impairment of a $16.7million insurance-related receivable as well certain contingent liabilities as more fully described below. The Company's receivable arose from the improper and premature cancellation by National Union of its property insurance coverage in April2001. The Company had paid to National Union amounts in excess of $10million in prepaid premiums for property insurance coverage that was to continue through at least April2002. In addition, the Company has a $6.7million receivable from NPS to reimburse it for payments on a premium finance agreement, proceeds of which were to pay premiums to National Union. The Company holds two $5million surety bonds issued by Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company ("Lumbermens") to secure the NPS indemnities. In addition, the Company has pending litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against National Union, First Capital Group, a New York based insurance wholesaler, NPS and other agents of National Union, for a refund of at least $10million of the prepaid premium plus other damages resulting from the cancellation of the coverage. The cancellation of the property insurance coverage in 2001 has no effect on the Company's present property insurance coverage or on coverage that existed through April2001.
With respect to the contingent liabilities arising from the NPS defaults, in November2002, Cananwill,Inc., a premium funding company, commenced litigation in Superior Court, Morris County, New Jersey, against the Company and others, alleging a balance due of $5.7million, plus interest and attorney's fees, on a premium finance agreement that funded premium payments made to National Union. The Company denies liability to Cananwill, believes it has meritorious defenses to assert, and it will vigorously defend itself. In the event of litigation and an adverse determination, the Company will seek reimbursement of any loss from the bonds securing the NPS indemnification agreements as well as from all third parties responsible for the misapplication of its payments.
In November2002, the Company commenced an action against Lumbermens in the District Court, City and County of Denver, Colorado to recover on the two $5million surety bonds securing the NPS indemnification agreements, which action was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. In December2002, Lumbermens commenced a separate action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking declarations of the invalidity of the surety bonds and damages. The Company and Lumbermens have engaged in preliminary settlement negotiations to resolve the litigation between them. Finally, in November2002 the Company was served with a third party complaint served on it by XL Reinsurance American,Inc. ("XL") and Greenwich Insurance Company ("Greenwich"). XL, Greenwich, Lumbermens and others were named as defendants in this action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by WestRM  West Risk Markets,Ltd. to collect on surety bonds issued by XL, Greenwich and Lumbermens allegedly to secure payment obligations due on a premium funding made by WestRM. XL and Greenwich assert that if they have any liability to WestRM, which they deny, then the Company is liable to XL and Greenwich pursuant to an alleged indemnification agreement. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to assert and will vigorously defend itself against these claims, and vigorously prosecute its own claims.
Although the outcome of any claim or matter in litigation is uncertain, the Company does not believe that it will incur any material loss in connection with the insurance-related receivable or that the ultimate outcome of these separate but related matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.
In 1998 and 1999, prior to the Casden Merger and the related NAPICO acquisition, investors holding limited partnership units in various limited partnerships of which NAPICO is the corporate general partner, commenced an action against NAPICO and certain other defendants. The claims related to activities that pre-dated the Casden Merger and included, but were not limited to, claims for breaches of fiduciary duty to the limited partners of certain NAPICO managed partnerships and violations of securities laws by making materially false and misleading statements in the consent solicitation statements sent to the limited partners of such partnerships. The actions were certified as a class action, and in October and November2002 were tried in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. In November2002, the jury returned special verdicts against NAPICO and certain other defendants in the amount of approximately $25.2million for violations of securities laws and against NAPICO for approximately $67.3million for breaches of fiduciary duty. In addition, the jury awarded the plaintiffs punitive damages against NAPICO of approximately $92.5million. NAPICO and the other defendants have submitted motions seeking to set aside the verdict in its entirety, with oral argument scheduled for March12, 2003. While the matter is not yet final and no judgment has been entered, the matter is the responsibility of the former shareholders of Casden pursuant to documents related to the Casden Merger, which was completed in March2002. The Company does not believe that the ultimate outcome will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations taken as a whole.
F-24 Operating Leases The Company is obligated under office space and equipment non-cancelable operating leases. In addition, the Company subleases certain of its office space to tenants under non-cancelable subleases. Approximate minimum annual rentals under operating leases and approximate minimum payments to be received under annual subleases for the five years ending after December31, 2002 are as follows (in thousands): Operating Lease Payments Sublease Receipts 2003 $ 5,549 $ 1,044 2004 5,181 1,065 2005 4,130 894 2006 3,819 819 2007 3,764 842 Total $ 22,443 $ 4,664 Substantially all of the office space and equipment subject to the operating leases described above are for the use of its corporate offices and regional operating centers. Rent expense recognized totaled $5.0million, $4.5million, and $5.6million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, including amounts recognized in 2000 by the unconsolidated subsidiaries. Sublease receipts for 2002, 2001 and 2000 were not material.
NOTE 13  Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities In connection with the Insignia merger in 1998, the Company assumed the obligations under Trust Based Convertible Preferred Securities with an aggregate liquidation amount of $149.5million. The securities mature on September30, 2016 and require distributions at the rate of 6.5% per annum, with quarterly distributions payable in arrears. The securities are convertible by the holders at any time through September30, 2016 and may be redeemed by the Company on or after November1, 1999. Each $50 of liquidation value of the securities can be converted into Common Stock at a conversion price of $49.61, which equates to 1.007 shares of Common Stock. Since 1998 when these securities were assumed, $134.4million of the $149.5million has been converted, resulting in $15.1million remaining as of December31, 2002. In 2002 and 2001, the holders of the securities converted approximately $5.5million and $11.7million, respectively, into approximately 107,000 and 238,000 shares of Common Stock.
F-25 NOTE 14  Transactions Involving Minority Interest in AIMCO Operating Partnership The Company completed tender offers for limited partnership interests and acquisitions of individual properties resulting in the issuance of approximately 331,000 and 912,000 common OP Units in 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Common Stock On June5, 2002, AIMCO completed the sale of 8,000,000 shares of Common Stock in an underwritten public offering at a net price of $46.17per share. The net proceeds of approximately $369million were used to repay outstanding short-term indebtedness under the Company's credit facility and a portion of the Casden Loan.

F-30 During 2002 and 2001, the Company issued approximately 188,000 shares and 241,000 shares, respectively, of Common Stock to certain executive officers (or entities controlled by them) at market prices. In exchange for the shares purchased, the executive officers (or entities controlled by them) executed notes payable totaling $7.8million and $10.7million, respectively. These notes, which are 25% recourse to the holder, have a 10-year maturity and bear interest at rates between 6.25% and 7.25% annually. Total payments on such notes from officers in 2002 and 2001 were $5.3million and $8.5million, respectively. In addition, in 2002 and 2001, the Company issued approximately 80,000 and 172,000 restricted shares of Common Stock, respectively, to certain employees. The restricted stock was issued at the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of issuance. The restricted stock may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of and is subject to a risk of forfeiture within the applicable vesting period (3 to 5years).
During 2002 the Company did not repurchase any shares of Common Stock. During 2001, the Company repurchased and retired approximately 772,000 shares of Common Stock at an average price of $43.15 per share.
NOTE 17  Stock Option Plans and Stock Warrants The Company has adopted the 1994 Stock Option Plan of Apartment Investment and Management Company (the "1994 Plan"), the Apartment Investment and Management Company 1996 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the "1996 Plan"), the Apartment Investment and Management Company 1997 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the "1997 Plan") and the Apartment Investment and Management Company Non-Qualified Employee Stock Option Plan (the "Non-Qualified Plan") to attract and retain officers, key employees and independent directors. The 1994 Plan provides for the granting of a maximum of 150,000 options to purchase common shares. The 1996 Plan provides for the granting of a maximum of 500,000 options to purchase common shares. The 1997 Plan provides for the granting of a maximum of 20,000,000 options to purchase common shares. The Non-Qualified Plan provides for the granting of a maximum of 500,000 options to purchase common shares and allows for the granting of non-qualified stock options. The 1994 Plan, the 1996 Plan and the 1997 Plan allow for the grant of incentive and non-qualified stock options, and together with the Non-Qualified Plan, are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The 1994 Plan also provides for a formula grant of the non-qualified stock options to the independent directors to be administered by the Board of Directors to the extent necessary. The exercise price of the options granted may not be less than the fair market value of the common stock at the date of grant. The term of the incentive and non-qualified options is ten years from the date of grant. The options vest over a period of one to five-years from the date of grant. Terms may be modified at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ("APB 25") and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation ("SFAS123"), requires the use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and warrants. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options and warrants equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by SFAS123, which also requires that the information be determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options and warrants granted subsequent to December31, 1994 under the fair value method. The fair value for these options and warrants was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes valuation model with the following assumptions: 2002 2001 2000 Risk free interest rate 4.2 % 4.4 % 6.1 % Expected dividend yield 7.5 % 6.9 % 6.8 % Volatility factor of the expected market price of the Company's Common Stock 0.210 0.193 0.192 Weighted average expected life of options 4.5 years 4.5 years 4.5 years The Black-Scholes valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options and for warrants which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, the valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. The Company's stock options and warrants have F-31 characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and warrants; therefore, changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair values of the options are amortized over the options' vesting period. The Company's pro forma information for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 is as follows (in thousands, except per share data): 2002 2001 2000 Reported net income attributable to common stockholders $ 75,488 $ 17,021 $ 35,995 Less compensation expense (pro forma) 7,587 3,241 4,599 Pro forma net income attributable to common stockholders $ 67,901 $ 13,780 $ 31,396 Basic earnings per common share: Reported $ 0.88 $ 0.23 $ 0.53 Pro forma $ 0.79 $ 0.19 $ 0.46 Diluted earnings per common share: Reported $ 0.87 $ 0.23 $ 0.52 Pro forma $ 0.78 $ 0.19 $ 0.45 The effects of applying SFAS123 in calculating pro forma income attributable to common stockholders and pro forma basic earnings per share may not necessarily be indicative of the effects of applying SFAS123 to future years' earnings.

As a part of the transaction, the Company also sold a warrant to purchase 875,000 shares of Common Stock for $4.15million. On January14, 2002, AIMCO redeemed the ClassB Preferred Units, paid accrued dividends and settled the warrant for a total of 447,991 shares of Common Stock and 444,247 common OP Units.
On December2, 1997, AIMCO issued warrants (the "Oxford Warrants") exercisable to purchase up to an aggregate of 500,000 shares of Common Stock at $41 per share. The Oxford Warrants were issued to affiliates of Oxford Realty Financial Group,Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Oxford"), in connection with the amendment of certain agreements pursuant to which the Company manages properties formerly controlled by Oxford or its affiliates. The Oxford Warrants were amended in connection with the acquisition of the Oxford entities in September2000, are currently exercisable and expire on December31, 2006.
Effective January1, 2003, the Company adopted the accounting provisions of SFAS123 and will transition using the prospective method. Under this method, the Company will now apply the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS123 to all employee awards granted, modified, or settled on or after January1, 2003, which will result in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock option.
The Company also grants restricted stock awards as part of its equity compensation plan. For the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company granted restricted stock awards with weighted average fair values per share of $43.65, $47.82 and $40.14, respectively. These awards are amortized to compensation expense over the applicable vesting period (3 to 5years).
F-33 NOTE 18  Earnings per Share The following table illustrates the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 (in thousands, except per share data): 2002 2001 2000 Numerator: Income from continuing operations $ 175,183 $ 103,113 $ 94,823 Less: Net income attributable to preferred stockholders (93,558 ) (90,331 ) (63,183 ) Numerator for basic and diluted earnings per share  Income from continuing operations $ 81,625 $ 12,782 $ 31,640 Net income $ 169,046 $ 107,352 $ 99,178 Less: Net income attributable to preferred stockholders (93,558 ) (90,331 ) (63,183 ) Numerator for basic and diluted earnings per share  Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 75,488 $ 17,021 $ 35,995 Denominator: Denominator for basic earnings per share  weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding 85,698 72,458 67,572 Effect of dilutive securities: Dilutive potential common shares 1,075 1,190 1,491 Denominator for diluted earnings per share 86,773 73,648 69,063 Earnings per common share: Basic earnings per common share: Income from continuing operations (net of preferred dividends) $ 0.95 $ 0.17 $ 0.47 Discontinued operations (0.07 ) 0.06 0.06 Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 0.88 $ 0.23 $ 0.53 Diluted earnings per common share: Income from continuing operations (net of preferred dividends) $ 0.94 $ 0.17 $ 0.46 Discontinued operations (0.07 ) 0.06 0.06 Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 0.87 $ 0.23 $ 0.52 The ClassB Preferred Stock, the ClassK Preferred Stock, the ClassL Preferred Stock, the ClassM Preferred Stock, the ClassN Preferred Stock, the ClassO Preferred Stock and the ClassP Preferred Stock are convertible into Common Stock (see Note16). The ClassC Cumulative Preferred Stock, the ClassD Cumulative Preferred Stock, the ClassG Cumulative Preferred Stock, the ClassH Cumulative Preferred Stock, the ClassQ Preferred Stock and the ClassR Preferred Stock are not convertible. All of the convertible preferred stock is anti-dilutive on an "as converted" basis, therefore, all of the dividends are deducted to arrive at the numerator and no additional shares are included in the denominator. Vested and unvested stock options, together with shares issued for non-recourse notes receivable, and restricted stock awards totaling approximately 3.6million for the year ended December31, 2002 have been excluded from diluted earnings per share as their effect would be anti-dilutive. For the years ended December31, 2001 and 2000, no material amounts of vested and unvested stock options, non-recourse shares or restricted stock awards were excluded as their effect was dilutive.
NOTE 19  Recent Accounting Developments In July2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.141, Business Combinations ("SFAS141") and Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS142"). SFAS141 requires the Company to reflect intangible assets apart from goodwill and supercedes previous guidance related to business combinations. The requirements of SFAS141 are effective for any business combination accounted for by the purchase method that is completed after June30, 2001. The adoption of SFAS141 did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations taken as a whole. SFAS142 eliminates amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and requires the Company to perform impairment tests at least annually on all goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. The Company adopted the requirements of SFAS142 beginning January1, 2002, and has completed the transitional goodwill impairment test required by SFAS142 and did not identify any impairments.
F-34 The adoption of the non-amortization provision of SFAS142 affected net income and earnings per share for the years ended December31, 2002, and would have affected net income and earnings per share for the years ended December31, 2001 and 2000, as shown below (in thousands, except per share amounts): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Reported income from continuing operations $ 175,183 $ 103,113 $ 105,362 Add back: goodwill amortization  7,899 7,440 Adjusted minority interest in AIMCO Operating Partnership  (1,027 ) (670 ) Adjusted income from continuing operations $ 175,183 $ 109,985 $ 112,132 Reported net income $ 169,046 $ 107,352 $ 99,178 Add back: goodwill amortization  7,899 7,440 Adjusted minority interest in AIMCO Operating Partnership  (1,027 ) (670 ) Adjusted net income $ 169,046 $ 114,224 $ 105,948 Basic earnings per common share: Income from continuing operations (net of preferred dividends) $ 0.95 $ 0.17 $ 0.47 Goodwill amortization  0.11 0.11 Minority interest in AIMCO Operating Partnership  (0.01 ) (0.01 ) Adjusted income from continuing operations $ 0.95 $ 0.27 $ 0.57 Reported net income attributable to common stockholders $ 0.88 $ 0.23 $ 0.53 Goodwill amortization  0.11 0.11 Minority interest in AIMCO Operating Partnership  (0.01 ) (0.01 ) Adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders $ 0.88 $ 0.33 $ 0.63 Diluted earnings per common share: Income from continuing operations (net of preferred dividends) $ 0.94 $ 0.17 $ 0.46 Goodwill amortization  0.11 0.11 Minority interest in AIMCO Operating Partnership  (0.01 ) (0.01 ) Adjusted income from continuing operations $ 0.94 $ 0.27 $ 0.56 Reported net income attributable to common stockholders $ 0.87 $ 0.23 $ 0.52 Goodwill amortization  0.11 0.11 Minority interest in AIMCO Operating Partnership  (0.01 ) (0.01 ) Adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders $ 0.87 $ 0.33 $ 0.62 In April2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.145, Rescission of FASB Statements No.4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No.13, and Technical Corrections ("SFAS145"). SFAS145 rescinds Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.4 ("SFAS 4"), which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item, net of related income tax effect. Historically, the Company has included these costs in interest expense. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.64 amended SFAS 4, and is no longer necessary because SFAS 4 has been rescinded. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.44 and the amended sections of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.13 are not applicable to the Company and therefore have no effect on the Company's financial statements. SFAS145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May15, 2002, with early application encouraged. The adoption of SFAS145 did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as whole because the Company has previously included these costs in interest expense.
In July2002, the FASB issued Statement No.146 "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("SFAS146"). SFAS146 requires that expenses associated with restructuring charges be accrued as liabilities in the period in which the liability is incurred. We are required to adopt SFAS146 on January1, 2003. The Company does not anticipate F-35 that the adoption of SFAS146 will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.
In November2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No.45 "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" ("FIN 45"). FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, at the inception of certain guarantees, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The accounting provisions and new disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are required to be adopted for all guarantees issued or modified on or after January1, 2003. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of FIN 45 will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.
In December2002, the FASB issued Statement No.148 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure" ("SFAS148"). SFAS148 amends SFAS123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to provide transition alternatives for adopting the accounting provisions of SFAS123 and also amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS123. Additionally, SFAS148 requires disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS148 in Note17 of these consolidated financial statements. The transition provisions of SFAS148 will be adopted on January1, 2003 when the Company adopts the accounting provisions of SFAS123. See Note17 for information on the impact the adoption of SFAS148 will have on the Company's consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
In January2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No.46 "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46"). In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a)does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b)has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. A variable interest entity often holds financial assets, including loans or receivables, real estate or other property. A variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in activities on behalf of another company. Until now, a company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests. FIN 46 changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity's activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity's residual returns or both. FIN 46's consolidation requirements apply immediately to variable interest entities created or acquired after January31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June15, 2003. Certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after January31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. The Company has adopted FIN 46 effective January31, 2003. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of FIN 46 will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.
NOTE 20  Dilutive Securities In January1998, the AIMCO Operating Partnership sold an aggregate of 15,000 ClassI High Performance Partnership Units to a joint venture comprised of fourteen members of AIMCO's senior management and to three of AIMCO's independent directors for $2.1million in cash. The value of these units was determined on December31, 2000 and the 15,000 units were adjusted to 2,379,084 units in January2001. The holders of these units receive distributions and allocations of income and loss from the AIMCO Operating Partnership in the same amounts and at the same times as would holders of the same number of common OP Units.
In June2001, AIMCO stockholders approved the sale by the AIMCO Operating Partnership of an aggregate of 15,000 of its ClassII, III, and IV High Performance Partnership Units (the "ClassII Units," "ClassIII Units" and "ClassIV Units," respectively) to three limited liability companies owned by a limited number of AIMCO employees for an aggregate offering price of $4.9million.
The valuation period for the ClassIII Units ended on December31, 2002, with no value added, and therefore the allocable investment made by the holders of $1.793million was lost. The valuation period for the ClassII Units had previously ended on December31, 2001, with no value added, and therefore the allocable investment made by the holders of $1.275million was lost. The valuation period for the ClassIV Units ends December31, 2003.
F-36 On April26, 2002, AIMCO stockholders approved the sale by the AIMCO Operating Partnership of up to 5,000 of its ClassV High Performance Partnership Units (the "ClassV Units," together with the ClassII Units, ClassIII Units and ClassIV Units, the "High Performance Units"), to a limited liability company owned by a limited number of AIMCO employees for an aggregate offering price of up to $1.1million. An aggregate of 4,398 ClassV Units were sold, for an aggregate offering price of $938,000. The ClassV Units have identical characteristics to the ClassIV Units sold in 2001, except for the dilutive impact limit, which was reduced from 1.5% to 1.0%, and a different three-year measurement period. The valuation period of the ClassV Units began on January1, 2002 and will end on December31, 2004.
At December31, 2002, the Company did not meet the required measurement benchmarks for ClassIV Units or ClassV Units, and therefore, the Company has not recorded any value to the High Performance Units in the consolidated financial statements as of December31, 2002, and such High Performance Units have had no dilutive effect. The table below illustrates the calculation of the value of High Performance Units at December31, 2002 (in thousands): Class of High Performance Unit Final Valuation Date AIMCO Total Return (1) Morgan Stanley REIT Index Minimum Return Out- performance Return Average Market Capitalization Out- performance Stockholder Value Added (2) Value of High Performance Units (3) OP Unit Dilution OP Unit Dilution% Class III December 31, 2002 -11.40 % 16.94 % 23.21 % 0.00 % $ 4,063,336 $ 0 $ 0 0 0.00 % Class IV December 31, 2003 -11.40 % 16.94 % 23.21 % 0.00 % $ 4,063,336 $ 0 $ 0 0 0.00 % Class V December 31, 2004 -11.58 % 3.64 % 11.00 % 0.00 % $ 4,269,792 $ 0 $ 0 0 0.00 % (1) Calculated based on a $48.36 starting price for Class III Units and Class IV Units and a $45.19 starting price for Class V Units, dividend reinvestment on the dividend payment date using the closing price for that date, and an ending price based on an average of the volume weighted average trading price for the 20 trading days immediately preceding the end of the period.

AIMCO has additional dilutive securities, which include options, warrants, convertible preferred securities and convertible debt securities. The following table presents the total number of shares of Common Stock that would be outstanding if all dilutive securities were converted or exercised (not all of which are included in the fully diluted share count) as of December31, 2002: Type of Security As of December 31, 2002 Common Stock 93,769,996 Common OP Units and equivalents 12,061,259 Vested options and warrants 4,505,561 Convertible preferred stock 7,621,570 Convertible preferred OP Units 3,409,248 Convertible debt securities 305,783 Total 121,673,417 F-37 NOTE 21  Transactions with Affiliates The Company earns revenue from unconsolidated real estate partnerships in which the Company is the general partner and has a 21% average ownership interest and earns fees from consolidated real estate partnerships. These revenues include property management services, partnership and asset management services, transactional services such as refinancing, construction supervisory and disposition services. Also, the Company is reimbursed for its costs in connection with the management of the unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Fees earned for these services for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $87.2 million, $128.8 million and $137.3 million, respectively, and include fees earned by the previously unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2000. The total accounts receivable due from affiliates was $47.1 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $4.1 million, at December 31, 2002, and $35.3 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $5.6 million at December 31, 2001.
Additionally, the Company earns interest income on notes from unconsolidated and consolidated real estate partnerships, in which the Company is the general partner and holds either par value or discounted notes. Interest income earned on par value notes totaled $26.6 million, $26.0 million, and $25.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Accretion income earned on discounted notes totaled $36.8 million, $9.9 million, and $26.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. See Note 7 for additional information on notes receivable primarily from unconsolidated real estate partnerships.
The accounts receivable and notes receivable from affiliates due from consolidated real estate partnerships are fully eliminated in the consolidated balance sheets. The income from services and interest income earned on notes from consolidated real estate partnerships is eliminated in the consolidated statements of income to the extent of the Company's ownership. Any intercompany profits on income earned from unconsolidated real estate partnerships is eliminated in the consolidated statements of income to the extent of the Company's ownership.
NOTE 22  Employee Benefit Plans The Company offers medical, dental, life and short-term and long-term disability benefits to employees of the Company through insurance coverage of Company-sponsored plans. The medical and dental plans are self-funded and are administered by independent third parties. In addition, the Company also participates in a 401(k) defined-contribution employee savings plan. Employees who have completed six months of service are eligible to participate. The Company matches 50% to 100% of the participant's contributions to the plan up to a maximum of 6% of the participant's prior year compensation. The Company match percentage is based on employee tenure. The expense incurred by the Company totaled approximately $2.6million, $2.8million and $3.7million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

During the quarter ended December31, 2002, the Company recorded in gain (loss) on dispositions of real estate a loss of $38.0million. This $38.0million loss resulted primarily from a change in estimate due to better insight into information related to the finalization of the recording of purchase price accounting to appropriate entities aquired in past acquisitions and the related historical estimation process in determining the carrying value of assets sold. The recognition of this amount in the current period is considered to be a change in estimate associated with the historical estimated gain or loss on the sale of these properties. In the prior quarters, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $10.0million related to this same change in estimate, resulting in a total change in estimate for the year ended December31, 2002 of $28.0million. The recognition of this change in estimate resulted in a decrease in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.28 for the year ended December31, 2002.
During the quarter ended December31, 2001, the Company recorded the following adjustments affecting previous quarters. These adjustments, in total, did not have an overall material impact on net income for any one quarter.
Adjustment Income (Expense) (in thousands) Interest expense $ 10,598 Capitalized costs 4,629 Distributions to minority partners in excess of income (9,207 ) Insurance claim losses (4,016 ) Interest and other income (3,400 ) Depreciation and amortization expense (3,202 ) Health insurance (1,950 ) Other (1,282 ) Net expense (7,830 ) Minority interest share 1,018 Impact on net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2001 $ (6,812 ) F-39 NOTE 24  Industry Segments The Company has two reportable segments: real estate (owning and operating apartments); and investment management business (providing, to third parties and affiliates, services relating to the apartment business). The Company owns and operates apartment communities throughout the United States and Puerto Rico that generate rental and other property related income through the leasing of apartment units to a diverse base of residents. The Company separately evaluates the performance of each of its apartment communities. However, because each of its apartment communities has similar economic characteristics, the apartment communities have been aggregated into a single apartment communities, or real estate, segment. The Company considers disclosure of different components of the multifamily housing business to be useful. All real estate revenues are from external customers and no revenues are generated from transactions with other segments. A significant portion of the revenues earned in the investment management business are from transactions with affiliates in the real estate segment. In 2002, the Company formed Aimco Capital to integrate affordable property operations within its real estate segment, and asset management and transaction activities within its investment management business.
No single resident or related group of residents contributed 10% or more of total revenues during the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 or 2000. The Company also manages apartment properties and provides other services for third parties and affiliates through its investment management business segment. As disclosed, a significant portion of the revenues of the investment management business is from affiliates.
A performance measure the Company uses for each segment is its contribution to free cash flow ("Free Cash Flow" or "FCF"). The Company defines Free Cash Flow as net operating income less the capital spending required to maintain and improve the related assets. Free Cash Flow measures profitability prior to the cost of capital. Other performance measures the Company uses include funds from operations, adjusted funds from operations and earnings before structural depreciation. The Company deducts Capital Replacement spending to arrive at Free Cash Flow and adjusted funds from operations. In addition, beginning in the second quarter of 2002, the Company began deducting Capital Enhancement spending. This additional deduction is reflected on a prospective basis. Certain reclassifications have been made to 2001 and 2000 amounts to conform to the 2002 presentation. These reclassifications primarily represent presentation changes related to discontinued operations resulting from the adoption of SFAS144 in 2002.
The following tables present the contribution (separated between consolidated and unconsolidated activity) to the Company's Free Cash Flow for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, from these segments, and a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to funds from operations, funds from operations less actual spending for Capital Replacements and Capital Enhancements, and net income (in

The Company uses Free Cash Flow, Earnings Before Structural Depreciation, Funds From Operations, and Adjusted Funds From Operations as performance measurement standards. These should not be considered alternatives to net income or net cash flow from operating activities, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), or as an indication of its performance or as a measure of liquidity.
"Free Cash Flow" or "FCF" is defined by the Company as net operating income less the Capital Replacement spending required to maintain, and the Capital Enhancement spending made to improve, the related assets. FCF measures profitability prior to the cost of capital.
"Earnings Before Structural Depreciation" or "EBSD" is defined by the Company as net income (loss), determined in accordance with GAAP, plus "structural depreciation," (i.e., depreciation of buildings and land improvements whose useful lives exceed 20years).
"Funds From Operations" or "FFO" is defined by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items and disposals from discontinued operations, net of related income taxes, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of financing costs), including depreciation for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and discontinued operations. The Company calculates FFO based on the NAREIT definition, as further adjusted for minority interest in the AIMCO Operating Partnership, plus amortization of intangibles, plus distributions to minority partners in excess of income and less dividends on preferred stock. The Company calculates FFO (diluted) by adding back the interest expense and preferred dividends relating to convertible securities whose conversion is dilutive to FFO. The Company's basis for computing FFO may not be comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts.
"Adjusted Funds From Operations" or "AFFO" is defined by the Company as FFO less Capital Replacement spending and, for 2002 and subsequent periods, Capital Enhancement spending. Capital Replacement spending was F-45 equal to $478 per unit for the year ended December31, 2002, $367 per unit for the year ended December31, 2001, and $300 per unit for the year ended December31, 2000. Capital Enhancement spending was equal to $46 per unit for the year ended December31, 2002. In the year ended December31, 2002, $8.0million in Capital Enhancement spending was deducted to arrive at AFFO. In 2001 and 2000 Capital Enhancement spending was not deducted to arrive at AFFO.

F-47 NOTE 25Income Taxes As discussed in Note6, prior to January1, 2001, the taxable REIT subsidiaries were not consolidated and therefore the associated income tax expense and related liabilities were included in the equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries and investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries, respectively.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of the taxable REIT subsidiaries for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company's deferred tax liabilities and assets are as follows (in thousands): December31, 2002 December31, 2001 Deferred tax liabilities: Partnership differences $ 48,773 $ 69,036 Bad debt reserves 6,215 1,526 Depreciation of fixed assets 8,801 9,165 Total deferred tax liabilities $ 63,789 $ 79,727 Deferred tax assets: Net operating and capital loss carryforward $ 16,700 $ 34,813 Receivables 6,264 6,264 Accrued expenses  3,500 Compensation and benefits 78 78 Section 197 intangibles 1,622 2,865 Accrued liabilities 8,080 8,080 Accrued interest expense 1,772 2,941 AMT credits 1,231 1,231 Other 21 23 Total deferred tax assets 35,768 59,795 Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets (8,659 ) (16,416 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 27,109 43,379 Net deferred tax (liabilities) assets $ (36,680 ) $ (36,348 ) Significant components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes are as follows and classified with management and other expenses in the Company's statement of income for 2002 and 2001 (in thousands): Year Ended December31, 2002 Year Ended December31, 2001 Year Ended December31, 2000 Current: Federal $ (302 ) $ 1,177 $ 963 State 1,686 135  Total current 1,384 1,312 963 Deferred: Federal (175 ) (2,978 ) 372 State (1,640 ) (341 ) 44 Total deferred (1,815 ) (3,319 ) 416 $ (431 ) $ (2,007 ) $ 1,379 F-48 Consolidated income (loss) subject to tax is $7,171,000 for 2002, $(4,851,000) for 2001, and $4,694,000 for 2000.

At December31, 2002, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) of approximately $42.3million for income tax purposes that expire in years 2012 to 2021. Subject to some limitations, the NOL carryover may be used to offset all or a portion of taxable income generated by the taxable REIT subsidiaries.
NOTE 26Transfers of Financial Assets In 2001, the Company sold certain tax-exempt bond receivables acquired in connection with its acquisition of OTEF (see Note4) to an unrelated third party at a discount to their face amount and retained a residual interest in the sold bonds. The fair value of the Company's retained residual interests were based on the future cash flows from the bonds. Gain or loss on sale of the tax-exempt bonds depends in part on the previous carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer, allocated between the assets sold and the retained residual interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer. To obtain fair values, quoted market prices are used if available. However, quotes are generally not available for retained residual interests, so the Company generally estimates fair value of the retained residual interests based on the present value of future expected cash flows of the bonds, which are derived from the underlying properties' operations. The fair value of both the retained residual interests and the bonds, based on the underlying properties that secure the bonds, were estimated using managements' best estimates of the key assumptions capitalization rates and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. The total fair value of the retained residual interests did not exceed the face amount of the bonds, less the sales price of the bonds, including any cash gains recognized upon the sale of the bonds.
Key economic assumptions used in measuring the fair value of retained residual interests at the date of the sale were as follows: 2001 Tax-Exempt Bonds Face value of bonds $ 283.9 million Sales price of bonds $ 257.8 million Fair value of retained residual interests $ 19.6 million Capitalization rates on the underlying properties 7.7% - 9.35% Impact on fair value of 10% adverse change in the fair value of the underlying properties None Impact on fair value of 20% adverse change in the fair value of the underlying properties $ 5.8 million decrease In 2001, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $253.3million and recognized gains of $26.1million on the sale and retained residual interests of these tax-exempt bonds. All gains and losses have been realized and were determined on the specific identification method and are reflected in interest and other income.
F-49 In 2002, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $27.3million and recognized gains of $7.7million in connection with the sale of certain assets, as well as additional proceeds received from the refinancing of the tax-exempt bonds of the underlying properties, and as a result the Company's retained residual interests aggregating approximately $27.0million were collected.
NOTE 27Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale In October2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ("SFAS144"). SFAS144 establishes criteria beyond that previously specified in Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of ("SFAS121"), to determine when a long-lived asset is classified as held for sale, and it provides a single accounting model for the disposal of long-lived assets. SFAS144 was effective beginning January1, 2002. Due to the adoption of SFAS144, the Company now reports as discontinued operations real estate assets held for sale (as defined by SFAS144) and real estate assets sold in the current period. All results of these discontinued operations, less applicable income taxes, are included in a separate component of income on the consolidated statements of income under the heading "discontinued operations." This change has resulted in certain reclassifications of 2001 and 2000 financial statement amounts.
The components of income (loss) from operations related to discontinued operations for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 are shown below. These include the results of operations through the date of each respective sale for sold properties and a full period of operations for those assets held for sale for the year ended December31, 2002 and a full period of operations for the years ended December31, 2001 and 2000 (dollars in thousands): 2002 2001 2000 RENTAL PROPERTY OPERATIONS: Rental and other property revenues $ 55,875 $ 73,097 $ 52,448 Property operating expense (26,524 ) (32,117 ) (26,763 ) Income from property operations 29,351 40,980 25,685 Depreciation of rental property (11,296 ) (18,579 ) (11,137 ) Interest expense (10,889 ) (18,353 ) (9,693 ) Interest and other income 121 176 278 Minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships (638 ) 1,357 (778 ) Operating earnings 6,649 5,581 4,355 Loss on dispositions of real estate, net of minority interest (8,958 )   Distributions to minority partners in excess of income (1,321 ) (1,342 )  Income tax arising from disposals (2,507 )   Income (loss) from discontinued operations $ (6,137 ) $ 4,239 $ 4,355 Included in the loss on dispositions of real estate was approximately $3.0million of impairments, or initial write-downs of the assets, that were recorded at the time properties were classified as assets held for sale during 2002. The remainder of the loss on dispositions of real estate of approximately $6.0million, net of minority interest, relates to the subsequent net loss recorded upon sale of the properties.
The Company is currently marketing for sale certain real estate properties that are inconsistent with its long-term investment strategies (as determined by management from time to time). The Company expects that all properties classified as held for sale will sell within one year from the date classified as held for sale. As of December31, 2002, the Company classified as assets held for sale eight properties with an aggregate of 2,214 units and a net book value of $64.5million. Other properties, both consolidated and unconsolidated, are being marketed for sale but are not accounted for as assets held for sale as they do not meet the criteria under SFAS144. In addition, as required by SFAS144, the $222.8 million of assets held for sale at December31, 2001, represent 24 properties with 5,526 units that were classified as assets held for sale during 2002.
F-50 NOTE 28Subsequent Events Dividend Declared On January30, 2003, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.82 per common share for the quarter ended December31, 2002, paid on February18, 2003, to stockholders of record on February11, 2003. The dividend is equivalent to an annualized dividend rate of $3.28 per common share, which remained the same as the previous annual dividend rate.
Amendment of Credit Facility and Term Loan On February14, 2003, the Company and its lenders amended the revolving credit facility to provide for a $100million increase, at the Company's option, in the available commitment to $500million (such commitment in excess of $400million is not available until it has been syndicated), reduced the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio from 1.60:1 to 1.50:1 through the maturity date and extend the maturity date one year to July31, 2005. Upon the effective date of the amendment, the margin on LIBOR-based loans and base rate loans was amended to a range between 2.05% to 2.65% and .55% to 1.15%, respectively, based on the fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, the Company and its lenders amended the Casden Loan with the same reduction in the fixed charge coverage ratio as stated above for the credit facility, through maturity, and to eliminate mandatory prepayments for the remainder of the term using proceeds from equity, sales or refinancing proceeds (except as such proceeds arise from transactions of the properties acquired in the Casden Merger).
Assets Held for Sale Subsequent to December31, 2002, an additional five properties with 1,226 units became classified as assets held for sale. At December31, 2002, these assets had a net book value of $29.0million with related liabilities of $20.6million.
