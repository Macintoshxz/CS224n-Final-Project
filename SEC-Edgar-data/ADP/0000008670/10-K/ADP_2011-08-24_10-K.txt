Leveraging 60 years of experience, ADP  offers a wide range of human resource (HR), payroll, tax and benefits administration solutions from a single source. ADP is also a leading provider of integrated computing solutions to automotive, truck, motorcycle, marine, recreational vehicle and heavy machinery dealers throughout the world.

The following summary describes ADPs activities.
Employer Services Employer Services offers a comprehensive range of HR information, payroll processing, tax and benefits administration solutions and services, including traditional and Web-based outsourcing solutions, that assist employers in the United States, Canada, Europe, South America (primarily Brazil), Australia and Asia to staff, manage, pay and retain their employees. As of June 30, 2010, Employer Services assisted approximately 520,000 employers with approximately 614,000 payrolls. Employer Services markets these solutions and services through its direct marketing salesforce and, on a limited basis, through indirect sales channels, such as marketing relationships with banks and accountants, among others. In fiscal 2010, 80% of Employer Services revenues were from the United States, 13% were from Europe, 5% were from Canada and 2% were from South America (primarily Brazil), Australia and Asia.
United States Employer Services approach to the market is to match clients needs to the solutions and services that will best meet their expectations. To facilitate this approach, in the United States, Employer Services is comprised of the following market-facing groups: Small Business Services (SBS) (serving primarily organizations with fewer than 50 employees); Major Account Services (serving primarily organizations with between 50 and 999 employees); and National Account Services (serving primarily organizations with 1,000 or more employees). In addition, Employer Services Added Value Services division provides services to clients across all three of these groups.
ADP provides payroll services that include the preparation of client employee paychecks, electronic direct deposits and stored value payroll cards, along with employee pay statements, supporting journals, summaries and management reports. ADP also supplies the quarterly and annual social security, medicare and federal, state and local income tax withholding reports required to be filed by employers. ADP enables its largest clients to interface their major enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications with ADPs outsourced payroll services. For those companies that choose to process payroll in-house, ADP delivers stand-alone services such as payroll tax filing, check printing and distribution, year-end tax statements ( i.e.
, Form W-2), wage garnishment services, health and welfare administration and flexible spending account (FSA) administration.
In order to address the growing business process outsourcing (BPO) market for clients seeking human resource information systems and benefit outsourcing solutions, ADP offers its integrated comprehensive outsourcing services (COS) solution that allows larger clients to outsource to ADP HR, payroll, payroll administration, employee service center, benefits administration, and time and labor management functions. For mid-sized clients, ADP Workforce Now Comprehensive Services provides integrated tools and technology to support payroll, a full-featured benefits administration solution, HR guidance and HR administration needs from recruitment to retirement. ADP also offers ADP Resource  , an integrated, flexible HR and payroll service offering for smaller clients that provides a menu of optional services, such as 401(k), FSA and a comprehensive Pay-by-Pay  workers compensation payment program.
2 ADPs Added Value Services division includes the following businesses: Tax and Financial Services, Insurance Services and Tax Credit Services. These businesses primarily support SBS, Major Account Services and/or National Account Services, and their services are sold through those businesses, as well as by dedicated sales teams and via marketing arrangements with alliance partners.
Tax and Financial   Services processes and collects federal, state and local payroll taxes on   behalf of, and from, ADP clients and remits these taxes to the appropriate   taxing authorities. This business provides an electronic interface between ADP   clients and over 7,600 federal, state and local tax agencies in the United   States, from the Internal Revenue Service to local governments. In fiscal   2010, Tax and Financial Services in the United States processed and delivered   approximately 47 million employee year-end tax statements and over 38 million   employer payroll tax returns and deposits, and moved $1.1 trillion in client   funds to taxing authorities and its clients employees via electronic   transfer, direct deposit and ADPCheck. Tax and Financial Services is also   responsible for the efficient movement of information and funds from clients   to third parties through service offerings such as new hire reporting,   TotalPay  payroll check (ADPCheck), full service direct deposit (FSDD), stored value   payroll card (TotalPay  Card), wage   verification services, unemployment claims processing, wage garnishment   processing, sales and use tax services and its new ADP Procure-to-Pay   Solutions SM ,   which automates the P2P supply chain and streamlines order, receipt, invoice   and payment processes.
Insurance Services   provides a comprehensive Pay-by-Pay workers compensation payment program and,   through Automatic Data Processing Insurance Agency, Inc., offers workers   compensation and group health insurance to small and mid-sized   clients.
Tax Credit Services   provides job tax credit services that assist employers in the identification   of, and filing for, federal, state and local tax credits and other incentives   based on geography, demographics and other criteria, and includes negotiation   of incentive packages with applicable governmental agencies.
Employer Services also provides the following solutions and services: Retirement Services   provides recordkeeping and/or related administrative services with respect to   various types of retirement (primarily 401(k) and SIMPLE IRA) plans, deferred   compensation plans and premium only cafeteria plans.
Pre-Employment Services   includes Screening and Selection Services and Applicant Management Services.   Screening and Selection Services provides background checks, reference   verifications and an HR help desk. Applicant Management Services provides   employers with a web-based solution to manage their talent throughout their   lifecycle.
ADPs Benefit Services   provides benefits administration across all market segments, including   management of open enrollment and ongoing enrollment of benefits, and leave of   absence, COBRA and FSA administration.
ADPs Time and Labor   Management Services provides solutions for employers to capture, calculate and   report employee time and attendance.
ADPs Talent Management   solutions include Performance Management, Compensation Management and Learning   Management.
3 In fiscal 2010, ADP made several acquisitions to help expand its client base and reach into adjacent markets, including: DO2 Technologies Inc., a leading provider of electronic-invoicing solutions; OneClick HR plc, a UK provider of human resources solutions offering HR software, training services and outsourced HR solutions; and HRinterax, Inc., an HR content and support services company focused on the small business market. In August 2010, ADP acquired Workscape, Inc., a leading provider of integrated benefits and compensation solutions and services.
International Employer Services has a growing presence outside of the United States, where it offers solutions on the basis of both geographic and specific client business needs. ADP offers in-country best of breed payroll and human resource outsourcing solutions to both small and large clients in over a dozen foreign countries. In each of Canada and Europe, ADP is the leading provider of payroll processing (including full departmental outsourcing) and human resource administration services. Within Europe, Employer Services has business operations supporting its in-country solutions in eight countries: France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It also offers services in Ireland (from the United Kingdom) and in Portugal (from Spain). In South America (primarily Brazil), Australia and Asia (primarily China), ADP provides traditional service bureau payroll and also offers full departmental outsourcing of payroll services. ADP also offers wage and tax collection and remittance services in Canada, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.
In fiscal 2010, ADP continued to expand its GlobalView  offering, making it available in 41 countries. GlobalView is built on the SAP  ERP Human Capital Management and the SAP NetWeaver  platform and offers multinational and global companies an end-to-end outsourcing solution enabling standardized payroll processing and human resource administration. As of the end of fiscal 2010, 96 clients had contracted for GlobalView services, with approximately 714,000 employees being processed. Upon completing the implementation for all these clients, ADP expects to be providing GlobalView services to nearly 1.3 million employees in 41 countries. Further, through its ADP Streamline  offering, ADP also provides a single point of contact for payroll processing and human resource administration services for multinational companies with small and mid-sized operations in 63 countries. At the end of fiscal 2010, ADP Streamline was used by 330 multinational companies with approximately 52,000 employees being processed.
Professional Employer Organization Services In the United States, ADPs TotalSource  , the Companys professional employer organization (PEO) business, provides approximately 5,600 clients with comprehensive employment administration outsourcing solutions through a co-employment relationship, including payroll, payroll tax filing, HR guidance, 401(k) plan administration, benefits administration, compliance services, health and workers compensation coverage and other supplemental benefits for employees. ADPs TotalSource is the largest PEO in the United States based on the number of paid worksite employees. ADPs TotalSource has 47 offices located in 22 states and serves approximately 211,000 worksite employees in all 50 states.
4 Dealer Services Dealer Services provides integrated dealer management systems (such a system is also known in the industry as a DMS) and other business management solutions to automotive, truck, motorcycle, marine, recreational vehicle (RV) and heavy machinery retailers in North America, Europe, Africa and the Asia Pacific region. Approximately 25,000 automotive, truck, motorcycle, marine, RV and heavy machinery retailers in over 90 countries use ADPs DMS products, other software applications, networking solutions, data integration, consulting and/or digital marketing services.
Clients use ADPs DMS solutions to manage core business activities such as accounting, inventory management, factory communications, appointment scheduling, vehicle financing and insurance, sales and service. In addition to its DMS solutions, Dealer Services offers its clients a full suite of additional integrated applications to address each department and functional area of the dealership, including Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications, front-end sales and marketing/advertising solutions, and an IP Telephony phone system fully-integrated into the DMS to help dealerships drive sales processes and business development initiatives. Dealer Services also provides its dealership clients computer hardware, hardware maintenance services, software support, system design and network consulting services.
Dealer Services also designs, establishes and maintains communications networks for its dealership clients that allow interactive communications among multiple site locations as well as links between franchised dealers and their vehicle manufacturer franchisors. These networks are used for activities such as new vehicle ordering and status inquiry, warranty submission and validation, parts and vehicle locating, dealership customer credit application submission and decision-making, vehicle repair estimation and acquisition of vehicle registration and lien holder information.
All of Dealer Services solutions are supported by comprehensive training offerings and business process consulting services. ADPs DMS and other software solutions are available as on-site applications installed at the dealership or as application service provider (ASP) managed services solutions (in which clients outsource their information technology management activities to Dealer Services).
In August 2010, ADP acquired Cobalt, a leading provider of digital marketing solutions for the automotive industry, for approximately $400 million.
Markets and Marketing Methods Employer Services offers services in the United States, Canada, Europe, South America (primarily Brazil), Australia and Asia. PEO Services are offered exclusively in the United States. Dealer Services has offerings in North America, Europe, Africa and the Asia Pacific region. In select emerging markets, Dealer Services uses distributors to sell, implement and support ADPs solutions.
None of ADPs major business groups has a single homogenous client base or market. Employer Services and PEO Services have clients from a large variety of industries and markets. Within this client base are concentrations of clients in specific industries. Dealer Services primarily serves automobile dealers, which in turn may be dependent on a relatively small number of automobile manufacturers, but also serves truck, powersports ( i.e.
, motorcycle, marine and recreational) and heavy machinery dealers, auto repair shops, used car lots, state departments of motor vehicles and manufacturers of automobiles and trucks. Employer Services also sells to automobile dealers. While concentrations of clients exist, no one client or industry group is material to ADPs overall revenues.
5 Historically ADPs businesses have not been overly sensitive to price changes, although in the current economic conditions we have observed, among some clients and groups of clients, an impact on sensitivity to pricing and demand for ADPs services. Employer Services revenues were flat in fiscal 2010. In the United States, revenues from our traditional payroll and payroll tax filing business declined 4% for the full year and beyond payroll revenues grew 6% for the full year. Dealer Services revenues decreased 3% in fiscal 2010 due to dealership consolidations and closings, lower transactional revenue and dealerships reducing services in order to cut their discretionary expenses. PEO Services revenues grew 11% in fiscal 2010 due to a 5% increase in the average number of worksite employees, as well as an increase in benefits costs and state uninsurance rates.
ADP enjoys a leadership position in each of its major service offerings and does not believe any major service or business unit in ADP is subject to unique market risk.
Competition The industries in which ADP operates are highly competitive. ADP knows of no reliable statistics by which it can determine the number of its competitors, but it believes that it is one of the largest providers of business outsourcing solutions in the world. Employer Services and PEO Services compete with other independent business outsourcing companies, companies providing enterprise resource planning services, software companies and financial institutions. Captive in-house functions, whereby a company installs and operates its own business processing systems, are another competitive factor in the industries in which Employer Services and PEO Services operate. Dealer Services competitors include full service DMS providers such as The Reynolds & Reynolds Company, Dealer Services largest DMS competitor in the United States and Canada, and companies providing applications and services that compete with Dealer Services non-DMS applications and services.
Competition in ADPs industries is primarily based on service responsiveness, product quality and price. ADP believes that it is very competitive in each of these areas and that there are no material negative factors impacting ADPs competitive position.
Clients and Client Contracts ADP provides its services to about 550,000 clients. In fiscal 2010, no single client or group of affiliated clients accounted for revenues in excess of 2% of annual consolidated revenues.
Our business is typically characterized by long-term client relationships that result in recurring revenue. ADP is continuously in the process of performing implementation services for new clients. Depending on the service agreement and/or the size of the client, the installation or conversion period for new clients could vary from a short period of time (as little as 24 hours) for an SBS client to a longer period (generally six to twelve months) for a National Account Services or Dealer Services client with multiple deliverables, and in some cases may exceed two years for a large GlobalView client or other large, complicated implementation. Although we monitor sales that have not yet been billed or installed, we do not view this metric as material in light of the recurring nature of our business. This is not a reported number, but it is used by management as a planning tool relating to resources needed to install services, and a means of assessing our performance against the installation timing expectations of our clients.
ADPs average client retention is estimated at just under 10 years in Employer Services, approximately 5 years in PEO Services and 10 or more years in Dealer Services, and has not varied significantly from period to period.
6 ADPs services are provided under written price quotations or service agreements having varying terms and conditions. No one price quotation or service agreement is material to ADP.
Systems Development and Programming During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, ADP invested $614 million, $588 million and $611 million, respectively, from continuing operations, in systems development and programming, migration to new computing technologies and the development of new products and maintenance of our existing technologies, including purchases of new software and software licenses.
Product Development ADP continually upgrades, enhances and expands its existing solutions and services. Generally, no new solution or service has a significant effect on ADPs revenues or negatively impacts its existing solutions and services, and ADPs solutions and services have significant remaining life cycles.
Licenses ADP is the licensee under a number of agreements for computer programs and databases. ADPs business is not dependent upon a single license or group of licenses. Third-party licenses, patents, trademarks and franchises are not material to ADPs business as a whole.
Number of Employees ADP employed approximately 47,000 persons as of June 30, 2010.
Item 1A. Risk Factors Our businesses routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate. Risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business. The following information should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion includes a number of forward-looking statements. You should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in the first paragraph under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, reference in this section to we, ours, us or similar terms means ADP, together with its subsidiaries. The level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time, and any of these risks may have a material effect on our business.
Changes in laws and regulations may decrease our revenues and earnings Portions of ADPs business are subject to governmental regulations. Changes in governmental regulations may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business. For example, a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities or client employees. In addition, changes in taxation requirements in the United States or in other countries could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income.
7 Security and privacy breaches may hurt our business We store electronically personal information about our clients and employees of our clients. In addition, our retirement services systems maintain investor account information for retirement plans. There is no guarantee that the systems and procedures that we maintain to protect against unauthorized access to such information are adequate to protect against all security breaches. Any significant violations of data privacy could result in the loss of business, litigation and regulatory investigations and penalties that could damage our reputation, and the growth of our business could be adversely affected.
Our systems may be subject to disruptions that could adversely affect our business and reputation Many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of complicated transactions. We rely heavily on our payroll, financial, accounting and other data processing systems. If any of these systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation. We have disaster recovery plans in place to protect our businesses against natural disasters, security breaches, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures or similar events. Despite our preparations, our disaster recovery plans may not be successful in preventing the loss of client data, service interruptions, disruptions to our operations, or damage to our important facilities.
If we fail to adapt our technology to meet client needs and preferences, the demand for our services may diminish Our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences. In order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands, we continually upgrade, enhance and expand our existing solutions and services. If we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges, the demand for our services may diminish.
Political and economic factors may adversely affect our business and financial results Trade, monetary and fiscal policies, and political and economic conditions may substantially change, and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility. When there is a slowdown in the economy, employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses. Clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services or renegotiating their contracts with us. In addition, the availability of financing, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our access to short-term debt markets to meet liquidity needs required by our Employer Services business.
We invest our client funds in liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, money market securities and other cash equivalents. Nevertheless, our client fund assets are subject to general market, interest rate, credit and liquidity risks, which individually or in unison may be exacerbated during periods of unusual financial market volatility.
We are dependent upon various large banks to execute Automated Clearing House and wire transfers as part of our client payroll and tax services. While we have contingency plans in place for bank failures, a systemic shut-down of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll and tax services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity.
We derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income from affiliates operating in non-U.S. dollar currency environments and, as a result, we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
8 Change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability The major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have consistently given us their highest long-term debt and commercial paper ratings. Failure to maintain high credit ratings on long-term and short-term debt could increase our cost of borrowing, reduce our ability to obtain intra-day borrowing required by our Employer Services business, and ultimately reduce our client interest revenue.
We may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel Our ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our clients. Competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel, results from our operations may suffer.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
Item 2. Properties ADP owns 41 of its processing/print centers, other operational offices, sales offices and its corporate headquarters complex in Roseland, New Jersey, which aggregate approximately 3,913,066 square feet. None of ADPs owned facilities is subject to any material encumbrances. ADP leases space for some of its processing centers, other operational offices and sales offices. All of these leases, which aggregate approximately 5,657,832 square feet in North America, Europe, South America (primarily Brazil), Asia, Australia and South Africa, expire at various times up to the year 2036. ADP believes its facilities are currently adequate for their intended purposes and are adequately maintained.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various claims and litigation. While the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable, the Company believes it has valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against it and the Company believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS ADP is one of the worlds largest providers of business outsourcing solutions. Leveraging over 60 years of experience, ADP offers a wide range of human resource (HR), payroll, tax and benefits administration solutions from a single source. ADP is also a leading provider of integrated computing solutions to automotive, truck, motorcycle, marine, recreational vehicle (RV) and heavy machinery dealers in North America, Europe, South Africa and the Asia Pacific region. The Companys reportable segments are: Employer Services, PEO Services and Dealer Services. A brief description of each segments operations is provided below.
Employer Services Employer Services offers a comprehensive range of HR information, payroll processing, tax and benefits administration solutions and services, including traditional and Web-based outsourcing solutions, that assist employers in the United States, Canada, Europe, South America (primarily Brazil), Australia and Asia to staff, manage, pay and retain their employees. As of June 30, 2010, Employer Services assisted approximately 520,000 employers with approximately 614,000 payrolls. From time to time, we reevaluate our employer count based upon updated information that helps us associate individual employer accounts with one another. As such, on a comparable basis, as of June 30, 2009, Employer Services assisted approximately 520,000 employers with approximately 619,000 payrolls. Employer Services categorizes its services as payroll and payroll tax, and beyond payroll. The payroll and payroll tax business represents the Companys core payroll processing and payroll tax filing business. The beyond payroll business represents services such as time and labor management, benefits administration, retirement recordkeeping and administration, and HR administration services. Within Employer Services, the Company collects client funds and remits such funds to tax authorities for payroll tax filing and payment services, and to employees of payroll services clients.
PEO Services PEO Services provides approximately 5,600 small and medium sized businesses with comprehensive employment administration outsourcing solutions through a co-employment relationship, including payroll, payroll tax filing, HR guidance, 401(k) plan administration, benefits administration, compliance services, health and workers compensation coverage and other supplemental benefits for employees.

Approximately 25,000 automotive, truck, motorcycle, marine, RV and heavy machinery retailers in over 90 countries use our DMS products, other software applications, networking solutions, data integration, consulting and/or digital marketing services. From time to time, we reevaluate our client count based upon updated information that helps us associate individual client accounts with one another. As such, on a comparable basis, as of June 30, 2009, Dealer Services provided DMS products to 26,000 retailers in over 90 countries.
14 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 (fiscal 2010), we maintained focus on the execution of our five-point strategic growth program, which consists of: Strengthening the core   business; Growing our   differentiated HR Business Process Outsourcing (BPO)   offerings; Focusing on   international expansion; Entering adjacent   markets that leverage the core; and Expanding pretax   margins.
ADPs fiscal 2010 was a challenging year and our results continued to be impacted by the economic downturn, including high unemployment levels, record-low interest rates and volatile financial markets. However, as we look back over fiscal 2010, we were pleased that ADPs financial results were better than we initially anticipated. The economy showed signs of stabilization early on in the fiscal year. Demand for ADPs solutions increased and key business metrics, including Employer Services sales, retention and pays per control, began to improve during the second half of the year.
Consolidated revenues grew 1%, to $8,927.7 million in fiscal 2010, from $8,838.4 million in fiscal 2009, aided by fluctuations in foreign currency rates, which increased revenues $68.2 million. In fiscal 2010, pretax earnings from continuing operations declined 2%, to $1,863.2 million, net earnings from continuing operations declined 9%, to $1,207.3 million, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 8%, to $2.40, from $2.62 in fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 included favorable tax items that reduced the provision for income taxes by $12.2 million and $120.0 million, respectively. Excluding the favorable tax items from both years, net earnings from continuing operations declined 1% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined slightly from $2.38 to $2.37.
Employer Services revenues were flat in fiscal 2010. In the United States, revenues from our traditional payroll and payroll tax filing business declined 4% for the full year and beyond payroll revenues grew 6% for the full year. Pays per control, which represents the number of employees on our clients payrolls as measured on a same-store-sales basis utilizing a subset of approximately 130,000 payrolls of small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions, decreased 3.4% in fiscal 2010, but were slightly positive in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Worldwide client retention increased 0.4 percentage points as compared to the prior year. PEO Services revenues grew 11% in fiscal 2010 due to a 5% increase in the average number of worksite employees, as well as an increase in benefits costs and state unemployment insurance rates. Employer Services and PEO Services worldwide new business sales, which represent annualized recurring revenues anticipated from sales orders to new and existing clients, increased 4%, to just over $1 billion in fiscal 2010. Dealer Services revenues decreased 3% in fiscal 2010 due to continued dealership consolidations and closings, lower transactional revenue and dealerships reducing services in order to cut their discretionary expenses.
Consolidated interest on funds held for clients declined 11%, or $67.0 million, to $542.8 million. The decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 3.6% in fiscal 2010 as compared to 4.0% in fiscal 2009. Average client funds balances increased slightly as a result of wage growth and an increase in state unemployment insurance withholdings offset by the decline in pays per control.
We have a strong business model, which has approximately 90% recurring revenues, excellent margins from the ability to generate consistent, healthy cash flows, strong client retention and low capital expenditure requirements. Additionally, ADP has continued to return excess cash to our shareholders. In the last five fiscal years, we have reduced the Companys common stock outstanding by approximately 15% through share buybacks, partially offset by common stock issued under employee stock-based compensation programs. We have also raised the dividend payout per share for 35 consecutive years.
15 We are especially pleased with the performance of our investment portfolio and the investment choices we made. Our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of sub-prime mortgages, alternative-A mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, asset-backed commercial paper, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment-grade fixed-income securities. We own senior tranches of fixed rate credit card, rate reduction, and auto loan asset-backed securities, secured predominately by prime collateral. All collateral on asset-backed securities is performing as expected. In addition, we own senior debt directly issued by Federal Home Loan Banks, Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). We do not own subordinated debt, preferred stock or common stock of any of these agencies. We do own AAA rated mortgage-backed securities, which represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a group or pool of one or more residential mortgages. These securities are collateralized by the cash flows of 15-year and 30-year residential mortgages and are guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as to the timely payment of principal and interest. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). This investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. In addition, our AAA credit rating has helped us maintain uninterrupted access to the commercial paper market.
Our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at June 30, 2010, with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1,775.5 million. Our net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,682.1 million in fiscal 2010, as compared to $1,562.6 million in fiscal 2009. This increase in cash flows from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 was due to tax refunds received and a reduction in cash bonuses paid, partially offset by an increase in pension plan contributions as compared to the prior year.
In August 2010, we completed the acquisition of two businesses, Cobalt and Workscape, Inc. Cobalt is a leading provider of digital marketing solutions for the automotive industry. It aligns with ADP Dealer Services global layered applications strategy and strongly supports Dealer Services long-term growth strategy. Workscape, Inc. is a leading provider of integrated benefits and compensation solutions and services.

Such increases were partially offset by a decrease in Dealer Services revenues of 3%, or $38.5 million, to $1,229.4 million, and a decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients of $67.0 million. The decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 3.6% in fiscal 2010 as compared to 4.0% in fiscal 2009. Employer Services revenues were flat in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009.
Total Expenses Our total expenses in fiscal 2010 increased $119.4 million, to $7,165.7 million, from $7,046.3 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in our consolidated expenses for fiscal 2010 was due to our increase in revenues, higher pass-through costs associated with our PEO Services business of $113.7 million, an increase of $48.6 million related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, an increase of $14.7 million related to additional domestic service personnel and incremental investments in our products. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in severance expenses of $76.8 million, a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $28.4 million and our costs savings initiatives, which included lower compensation from reduced headcount and a reduction in travel and entertainment expenses.
17 Our total costs of revenues increased $207.0 million to $5,029.7 million in fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009 due to the increase in operating expenses discussed below.
Operating expenses increased $190.2 million, or 5%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, due to an increase in PEO Services pass-through costs that are re-billable, including costs for benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees. These pass-through costs were $988.5 million in fiscal 2010, which included costs for benefits coverage of $811.5 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $176.9 million. These costs were $874.8 million in fiscal 2009, which included costs for benefits coverage of $724.3 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $150.5 million. In addition, operating expenses increased $30.1 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and $14.7 million due to additional service personnel. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.9 million in stock-based compensation expense and our costs savings initiatives, which included lower compensation from reduced headcount and a reduction in travel and entertainment expenses.
Systems development and programming expenses increased $15.6 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, due to incremental investments in our products during fiscal 2010. Additionally, systems development and programming expenses increased by $2.1 million due to expenses of acquired businesses and by $3.6 million due to the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These increases were partially offset by a $5.0 million decline in stock-based compensation expense.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $62.9 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease in expenses was due to a decrease in severance expenses of $76.8 million, a reduction in expenses of $31.1 million related to cost saving initiatives, which included lower compensation from reduced headcount and a reduction in travel and entertainment expenses and a decline of $14.5 million in stock-based compensation expense. In addition, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased due to the $15.5 million charge we recorded during fiscal 2009 to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of an increase in estimated credit losses related to our notes receivable from automotive, truck and powersports dealers. These decreases in expenses were partially offset by an asset impairment charge of $6.8 million, recorded during fiscal 2010 as a result of the announcement by General Motors Corporation (GM) that it will shut down its Saturn division. In addition, there was an increase of $13.7 million due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and an increase of $9.5 million in expenses of acquired businesses.
Interest expense decreased $24.7 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010 and 2009, the Companys average borrowings under the commercial paper program were $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 0.2% and 1.0%, respectively, which resulted in a decrease of $15.8 million in interest expense. In fiscal 2010 and 2009, the Companys average borrowings under the reverse repurchase program were approximately $425.0 million and $425.9 million, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 0.2% and 1.3%, respectively, which resulted in a decrease of $4.6 million in interest expense.
Other Income, net Years ended June 30, 2010 2009 $       Change (Dollars in millions) Interest income on corporate       funds $ (98.8 ) $ (134.2 ) $ (35.4 ) Realized gains on       available-for-sale securities (15.0 ) (11.4 ) 3.6 Realized losses on       available-for-sale securities 13.4 23.8 10.4 Realized (gain) loss on       investment in Reserve Fund (15.2 ) 18.3 33.5 Impairment losses on       available-for-sale securities 14.4 - (14.4 ) Net loss (gain) on sales of       buildings 2.3 (2.2 ) (4.5 ) Other, net (2.3 ) (2.3 ) - Other income, net $ (101.2 ) $ (108.0 ) $ (6.8 ) 18 Other income, net, decreased $6.8 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due to a $35.4 million decrease in interest income on corporate funds, a $14.4 million impairment loss on available-for-sale securities recorded during fiscal 2010 and a $2.3 million net loss on sales of buildings in fiscal 2010 as compared to a $2.2 million net gain on sales of buildings in fiscal 2009. Interest income on corporate funds decreased as a result of lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average daily balances. Average interest rates decreased from 3.6% in fiscal 2009 to 2.6% in fiscal 2010. Average daily balances increased from $3.7 billion in fiscal 2009 to $3.8 billion in fiscal 2010. These decreases in other income were partially offset by a gain on the investment in Reserve Fund of $15.2 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to a loss on the investment in the Reserve Fund of $18.3 million in fiscal 2009, as well as a $14.0 million increase in net realized gains on available-for-sale securities.
Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $36.9 million, or 2%, from $1,900.1 million in fiscal 2009 to $1,863.2 million in fiscal 2010 because the increase in revenues was more than offset by the increase in expenses and decrease in other income, net discussed above. Overall margin decreased 60 basis points in fiscal 2010.
Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 and 2009 was 35.2% and 30.3%, respectively. For fiscal 2010, the effective tax rate includes a reduction in the provision for income taxes of $12.2 million related to the resolution of certain tax matters, which decreased the effective tax rate by 0.7 percentage points. For fiscal 2009, the effective tax rate includes a reduction in the provision for income taxes of $120.0 million related to an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit settlement and the settlement of a state tax matter, which decreased the effective tax rate by 6.3 percentage points.
Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Net earnings from continuing operations decreased $117.8 million to $1,207.3 million in fiscal 2010, from $1,325.1 million in fiscal 2009, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 8%, to $2.40. The decrease in net earnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2010 reflects the decrease in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and the impact of the tax matters discussed above. The decrease in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2010 reflects the decrease in earnings from continuing operations and the impact of the tax matters discussed above partially offset by the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the repurchase of 18.2 million shares in fiscal 2010 and 13.8 million shares in fiscal 2009.
The following table reconciles the Companys results for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 to adjusted results that exclude the impact of favorable tax items. The Company uses certain adjusted results, among other measures, to evaluate the Companys operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods. The Company believes that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Companys management and improves their ability to understand the Companys operating performance. Since adjusted earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted EPS are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), they should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, earnings from continuing operations and diluted EPS from continuing operations, respectively, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

The decrease in net earnings from continuing operations, as adjusted, for fiscal 2010 reflects the decrease in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes. The decrease in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as adjusted, for fiscal 2010 reflects the decrease in net earnings from continuing operations, partially offset by the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the repurchase of approximately 18.2 million shares during fiscal 2010 and the repurchase of 13.8 million shares in fiscal 2009.

Such increases were partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which reduced our revenue by $187.4 million, or 2%, a decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients of $74.7 million and a decrease in Dealer Services revenues of 3%, or $33.9 million. The decrease in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 4.0% in fiscal 2009 as compared to 4.4% in fiscal 2008, and a decrease in our average client funds balances for fiscal 2009 of 3.1%, to $15.2 billion.
Total Expenses Our consolidated expenses decreased 1%, to $7,046.3 million in fiscal 2009, from $7,096.8 million in fiscal 2008. The decrease in our consolidated expenses was due to a decrease of $160.7 million, or 2%, related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of $168.8 million, which was attributable to lower selling expenses and cost saving initiatives that commenced in fiscal 2008 and continued in fiscal 2009. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $188.6 million attributable to the increase in our revenues discussed above. In addition, there was an increase in pass-through costs in our PEO business including costs associated with providing benefits coverage for worksite employees of $102.7 million and costs associated with workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes for worksite employees of $16.8 million.
21 Our total costs of revenues increased $165.5 million, to $4,822.7 million in fiscal 2009, from $4,657.2 million in fiscal 2008, due to an increase in our operating expenses of $188.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in our systems development and programming costs of $22.8 million.
Operating expenses increased $188.6 million, or 5%, in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to the increase in revenues described above, including the increases in PEO Services, which have pass-through costs that are re-billable including costs for benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees. These pass-through costs were $874.8 million in fiscal 2009, which included costs for benefits coverage of $724.3 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $150.5 million. These costs were $755.3 million in fiscal 2008, which included costs for benefits coverage of $621.6 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $133.7 million. The increase in operating expenses is also due to higher expenses in Employer Services of $64.5 million related to increased service costs for investment in client-facing associates. Such increases were partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses of approximately $83.7 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Systems development and programming expenses decreased $22.8 million, or 4%, in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to decreases related to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $15.8 million, a decrease in stock-based compensation expenses of $6.5 million and a decrease in programming expenses related to our systems of $3.9 million. The decrease in programming expenses was a result of a decrease in the average cost per associate as a larger percentage of our associates are located in off-shore and smart-shore locations. In addition, depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $0.3 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to decreases related to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $5.4 million, which were partially offset by increased amortization expenses of $4.7 million resulting from the intangible assets acquired with new businesses and the purchases of software and software licenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $168.8 million, or 7%, in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, which was attributable to decreases related to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $55.5 million, a decrease in selling expenses related to a decline in our new client sales of $45.6 million and a reversal of $23.3 million in expenses due to a favorable ruling related to an international business capital tax. In addition, the decrease is attributable to our cost saving initiatives that commenced in fiscal 2008 and continued in fiscal 2009, which included a reduction in payroll and payroll related expenses of $32.3 million and a decrease in stock-based compensation expenses of $16.3 million. Such decreases were partially offset by an increase in severance charges of $67.6 million and an increase in the provision for our allowance for doubtful accounts of $15.5 million due to losses related to our notes receivable from automotive, truck and powersports dealers.
Interest expense decreased $47.2 million in fiscal 2009 as a result of a decrease of $40.6 million related to our short-term commercial paper program and a decrease of $6.6 million related to our reverse repurchase program. In the aggregate, interest expense decreased by approximately $68.4 million related to decreases in interest rates and increased approximately $21.2 million related to increases in borrowings. In fiscal 2009 and 2008, the Companys average borrowings under the commercial paper program were $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 1.0% and 4.2%, respectively. In fiscal 2009 and 2008, the Companys average borrowings under the reverse repurchase program were approximately $425.9 million and $360.4 million, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 1.3% and 3.4%, respectively.

In the aggregate, interest income on corporate funds decreased by approximately $30.9 million related to decreases in interest rates and increased approximately $15.6 million related to increases in average daily balances. Average interest rates decreased from 4.4% in fiscal 2008 to 3.6% in fiscal 2009. Average daily balances increased from $3.4 billion in fiscal 2008 to $3.7 billion in fiscal 2009.
Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 5%, to $1,900.1 million in fiscal 2009, from $1,803.4 million in fiscal 2008, due to the increase in revenues and the decrease in expenses discussed above. Overall margin increased 80 basis points in fiscal 2009.
Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 was 30.3%, as compared to 35.9% in fiscal 2008. The decrease in the effective tax rate is due to a reduction in the provision for income taxes of $120.0 million related to favorable tax settlements, including an IRS audit settlement and the settlement of a state tax matter. These settlements decreased the effective tax rate by approximately 6.3 percentage points in fiscal 2009. Lastly, during fiscal 2008, there was a reduction in the provision for income taxes of $12.4 million related to the settlement of a state tax matter. This decreased the effective tax rate by approximately 0.7 percentage points in fiscal 2008.
Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Net earnings from continuing operations increased 15%, to $1,325.1 million, in fiscal 2009, from $1,155.7 million in fiscal 2008, and the related diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 20%, to $2.62 in fiscal 2009. The increase in net earnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2009 reflects the increased revenues, lower expenses and lower effective tax rate as described above. The increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2009 reflects the increase in net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer weighted average diluted shares outstanding due to the repurchase of 13.8 million shares in fiscal 2009 and 32.9 million shares in fiscal 2008.

Employer Services Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Revenues Employer Services' revenues increased $3.7 million to $6,442.6 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Revenues from our payroll and tax filing business declined 4% in fiscal 2010, due to a decline in pays per control and a decline in the number of payrolls processed, partially offset by pricing increases. Revenues from our beyond payroll services increased 6% in fiscal 2010, due to an increase in the number of clients utilizing our COBRA and HR Benefits solutions, as well as an increase in revenues related to our Retirement Services business due to an increase in the market value of the assets under management. Pays per control, which represents the number of employees on our clients payrolls as measured on a same-store-sales basis utilizing a subset of approximately 130,000 payrolls of small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions, decreased 3.4% in fiscal 2010. Worldwide client retention improved 40 basis points, to 89.9%, and pricing increases contributed approximately 1% to our revenue growth for fiscal 2010. In addition, interest on client funds recorded within the Employer Services segment increased $2.7 million in fiscal 2010 due to a slight increase in average client fund balances. We credit Employer Services with interest on client funds at a standard rate of 4.5%; therefore, Employer Services results are not influenced by changes in interest rates.
24 Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Employer Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $36.3 million to $1,722.4 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease was due to an increase in expenses of $40.0 million, which was partially offset by the $3.7 million increase in revenues discussed above. The increase in expenses can be attributed to $16.9 million of incremental investments in our products and an increase of $14.7 million related to increased service costs for investment in client-facing associates. These increases in expense were partially offset by lower expenses resulting from our cost savings initiatives, which included headcount reductions at the end of fiscal 2009 and a reduction in travel and entertainment expenses.
Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Revenues Employer Services' revenues increased $211.1 million, or 3%, to $6,438.9 million in fiscal 2009. Revenues from our payroll and payroll tax filing business were flat for fiscal 2009. Our payroll and payroll tax filing revenues were adversely impacted in fiscal 2009 due to the reduced number of payrolls processed, a decline in pays per control and a reduction in the average daily balances held, but these declines were offset by pricing increases. Our worldwide client retention decreased by 1.2 percentage points during fiscal 2009. Lost business due to clients pricing sensitivity and clients going out of business increased during fiscal 2009 as a result of economic pressures. Pays per control, which represents the number of employees on our clients payrolls as measured on a same-store-sales basis utilizing a subset of approximately 137,000 payrolls of small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions, decreased 2.5% in fiscal 2009.

Interest on client funds recorded within the Employer Services segment decreased $25.0 million, or 3.4% in fiscal 2009, as a result of a decrease in average daily balances from $15.5 billion for fiscal 2008 to $15.0 billion for fiscal 2009, related to lower bonuses, lower wage growth, and a decline in pays per control. The impact of pricing increases was an increase of approximately 2% to our revenue for fiscal 2009. Revenues from our beyond payroll services increased 8% in fiscal 2009 due to an increase in our Time and Labor Management and HR Benefits services revenues, due to an increase in the number of clients utilizing these services, partially offset by a decline in our Retirement Services revenues due to a decrease in the market value of the assets under management.
Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Employer Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $152.0 million, or 9%, to $1,758.7 million in fiscal 2009. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal 2009 grew at a faster rate than revenues due to a decrease of $57.7 million related to management incentive compensation expenses, slower growth in selling expenses of $36.2 million as compared to revenues due to a decline in our new client sales and our cost saving initiatives that commenced in fiscal 2008 and continued in fiscal 2009, including headcount reductions and curtailment of non-essential travel and entertainment expenses. These decreases in expenses were offset, in part, by higher expenses of $64.5 million related to increased service costs for investment in client-facing associates.
PEO Services Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Revenues PEO Services revenues increased $131.0 million, or 11%, to $1,316.8 million in fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, due to a 5% increase in the average number of worksite employees. The increase in the average number of worksite employees as compared to fiscal 2009 was due to an increase in the number of clients. Revenues associated with benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees that were billed to our clients increased $113.7 million due to the increase in the average number of worksite employees, as well as increases in health care costs.
Administrative revenues, which represent the fees for our services and are billed based upon a percentage of wages related to worksite employees, increased $11.8 million, or 5%, in fiscal 2010, due to the increase in the number of average worksite employees.
We credit PEO Services with interest on client funds at a standard rate of 4.5%; therefore, PEO Services results are not influenced by changes in interest rates. Interest on client funds recorded within the PEO Services segment increased $0.7 million in fiscal 2010 due to the increase in average client funds balances as a result of increased PEO Services new business and growth in our existing client base.

In addition, earnings before income taxes increased $9.2 million due to the settlement of a state unemployment tax matter. Such increases in earnings before income taxes were offset by price concessions and higher pass-through costs related to state unemployment taxes.
Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Revenues PEO Services revenues increased $125.3 million, or 12%, to $1,185.8 million in fiscal 2009 due to a 10% increase in the average number of worksite employees. The increase in the average number of worksite employees was due to new client sales. Revenues associated with benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees that were billed to our clients increased $119.5 million due to the increase in the average number of worksite employees, as well as increases in health care costs. Administrative revenues, which represent the fees for our services and are billed based upon a percentage of wages related to worksite employees, increased $15.3 million, or 7%, due to the increase in the number of average worksite employees. We credit PEO Services with interest on client funds at a standard rate of 4.5%; therefore, PEO Services results are not influenced by changes in interest rates. Interest on client funds recorded within the PEO Services segment increased $1.5 million in fiscal 2009 due to the increase in the average client funds balances as a result of increased PEO Services new business and growth in our existing client base. The average client funds balances were $0.2 billion in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008.
Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes PEO Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $15.6 million, or 15%, to $117.6 million in fiscal 2009.

Dealer Services Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Revenues Dealer Services' revenues decreased $38.5 million, or 3%, to $1,229.4 million in fiscal 2010. Revenues for our Dealer Services business would have declined approximately 4% for fiscal 2010 without the impact of acquisitions. Revenues declined $112.9 million due to client losses as a result of dealership closings, cancellation of services and continued pressure on dealerships to reduce costs. In addition, revenues decreased $25.1 million due to lower international software license fees and $5.3 million due to lower Credit Check and Computerized Vehicle Registration (CVR) transaction volume. These decreases in revenues were offset by a $90.0 million increase in revenues from new clients and growth in our key products during fiscal 2010. The growth in our key products was driven by increased users for Application Service Provider (ASP) managed services, growth in our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications and new network and hosted IP telephony installations.
26 Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Dealer Services' earnings from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $13.3 million, or 6%, to $201.0 million in fiscal 2010. The decrease was due to the decline in revenues of $38.5 million discussed above, which was partially offset by a decrease in expenses of $25.2 million. The decrease in expenses was due to certain cost saving initiatives, including headcount reductions at the end of fiscal 2009 and a reduction in travel and entertainment expenses, offset by an asset impairment charge of $6.8 million as a result of the announcement by GM that it will shut down its Saturn division.
Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Revenues Dealer Services' revenues decreased $33.9 million, or 3%, to $1,267.9 million in fiscal 2009. Revenues for our Dealer Services business would have declined approximately 4% for fiscal 2009 without the impact of acquisitions. The decrease in revenues was due to client losses and cancellation of services resulting from the consolidation and closing of dealerships and continued pressure on dealerships to reduce costs, all of which resulted in a decrease to revenues of $72.9 million for fiscal 2009. In addition, revenues decreased $23.9 million due to lower Credit Check, Laser Printing, and CVR transaction volume and $9.5 million due to a decrease in revenues from consulting services and forms and supplies. These decreases in revenues were offset by a $67.8 million increase in revenues from new clients and growth in our key products during fiscal 2009. The growth in our key products was driven by increased users for ASP managed services, growth in our CRM applications and new network and hosted IP telephony installations.
Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Dealer Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $5.8 million, or 3%, to $214.3 million in fiscal 2009 due to the decrease of $33.9 million in revenues discussed above, which was partially offset by a decrease in expenses of $28.1 million. The decrease in expenses was due to lower selling expenses of $11.4 million related to a decline in new client sales and a decrease of $13.2 million in expenses due to certain cost saving initiatives, including headcount reductions and curtailment of non-essential travel and entertainment expenses, and a decrease of $7.1 million related to management incentive compensation expenses.
Other The primary components of the Other segment are miscellaneous processing services, such as customer financing transactions, non-recurring gains and losses and certain expenses that have not been charged to the reportable segments, such as stock-based compensation expense. Stock-based compensation expense was $67.6 million, $96.0 million and $123.6 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
27 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At June 30, 2010, cash and marketable securities were $1,775.5 million, stockholders equity was $5,478.9 million and the ratio of long-term debt-to-equity was 0.7%. Working capital before funds held for clients and client funds obligations was $1,568.6 million, as compared to $1,515.5 million at June 30, 2009. This increase is due to cash generated from operations, partially offset by the use of cash to repurchase common stock, the use of cash for dividend payments and the use of cash for acquisitions.
Our principal sources of liquidity for operations are derived from cash generated through operations and through corporate cash and marketable securities on hand. We continued to generate positive cash flows from operations during fiscal 2010, and we held approximately $1.8 billion of cash and marketable securities at June 30, 2010. We also have the ability to generate cash through our financing arrangements under our U.S. short-term commercial paper program and our U.S. and Canadian short-term repurchase agreements to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.
Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,682.1 million in fiscal 2010, as compared to $1,562.6 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities was due to a $158.7 million tax refund received by a Canadian subsidiary of the Company in fiscal 2010, an increase in cash flows due to lower cash bonuses paid to our employees and an increase in cash flows related to collections from our clients. Such increases in net cash flows provided by operating activities were partially offset by an increase in pension plan contributions as compared to fiscal 2009, which decreased cash flows by $106.0 million. Lastly, there was a $77.1 million decrease due to income taxes paid in fiscal 2010 as a result of the agreement reached during fiscal 2009 with the IRS regarding all outstanding audit issues with the IRS for the tax years 1998 through 2006.
Net cash flows used in investing activities were $2,379.5 million in fiscal 2010, as compared to $644.1 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in net cash flows used in investing activities was due to the timing of purchases of and proceeds from the sales or maturities of marketable securities, which resulted in a net decrease to cash flows of $1,023.7 million and the timing of receipts and payments of cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations that resulted in a decrease to cash flows of $907.7 million. Such decreases to cash flows were partially offset by a reclassification, in fiscal 2009, from cash and cash equivalents to short-term marketable securities of $211.1 million related to the Reserve Fund discussed below. The proceeds received related to the Reserve Fund have been included in proceeds from the sales and maturities of corporate and client funds marketable securities.
Net cash flows provided by financing activities were $89.0 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to $468.4 in fiscal 2009. The decrease was due to a $1,460.0 million change in cash due to the repayment in fiscal 2010 of a $730.0 million commercial paper borrowing that was outstanding at June 30, 2009. In addition, there was a $186.0 million decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities due to an increase in cash used for repurchases of common stock. We purchased approximately 18.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $42.02 during fiscal 2010 as compared to purchases of 13.8 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $39.72 during fiscal 2009. Such decreases in cash flows of financing activities were partially offset by the net change in the client funds obligations of $1,135.2 million as a result of timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds obligations and an increase of $158.4 million in the proceeds from stock purchase plan purchases and exercises of stock options.
Our U.S. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained through a short-term commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $6.0 billion in aggregate maturity value of commercial paper. In August 2010, the Company increased the U.S. short-term commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to $6.25 billion in aggregate maturity value. Our commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poors and Prime-1 by Moodys. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. At June 30, 2010, there was no commercial paper outstanding. At June 30, 2009, we had $730.0 million in commercial paper outstanding. Such amount was repaid on July 1, 2009. In fiscal 2010 and 2009, our average borrowings were $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.2% and 1.0%, respectively. The weighted average maturity of our commercial paper was less than two days in both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. Throughout fiscal 2010, we had full access to our U.S. short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.
28 Our U.S. and Canadian short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements. These agreements are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. We have $2 billion available to us on a committed basis under these reverse repurchase agreements. At June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, there were no outstanding obligations under reverse repurchase agreements. In fiscal 2010 and 2009, we had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of $425.0 million and $425.9 million, respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.2% and 1.3%, respectively. We have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.
In June 2010, we entered into a $2.5 billion, 364-day credit agreement with a group of lenders. The 364-day facility replaced our prior $2.25 billion 364-day facility. In addition, we entered into a three-year $1.5 billion credit facility maturing in June 2013 that contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500.0 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The three-year facility replaced our prior $1.5 billion five-year facility, which expired in June 2010. We also have an existing $2.25 billion five-year credit facility that matures in June 2011 that also contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500.0 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The interest rate applicable to committed borrowings is tied to LIBOR, the federal funds effective rate or the prime rate depending on the notification provided by us to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing. We are also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. We had no borrowings through June 30, 2010 under the credit agreements. We believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the credit agreements to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $6.25 billion available to us under the credit agreements.
Our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of sub-prime mortgages, alternative-A mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, asset-backed commercial paper, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment-grade fixed-income securities. We own senior tranches of fixed rate credit card, rate reduction, auto loan and other asset-backed securities, secured predominately by prime collateral. All collateral on asset-backed securities is performing as expected. In addition, we own senior debt directly issued by Federal Home Loan Banks, Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). We do not own subordinated debt, preferred stock or common stock of any of these agencies. We do own AAA rated mortgage-backed securities, which represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a group or pool of one or more residential mortgages. These securities are collateralized by the cash flows of 15-year and 30-year residential mortgages and are guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as to the timely payment of principal and interest. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). This investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations.
Capital expenditures for continuing operations in fiscal 2010 were $90.2 million, as compared to $167.6 million in fiscal 2009 and $186.3 million in fiscal 2008. The capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 related to our data center and other facility improvements to support our operations. We expect capital expenditures in the year ending June 30, 2011 (fiscal 2011) to be between $150 million and $170 million.
29 The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2010: (In millions) Payments due by period Less than 1-3 3-5 More than Contractual       Obligations 1       year years years 5       years Unknown Total Debt Obligations (1) $ 2.8 $ 18.8 $ 3.6 $ 17.4 $ - $ 42.6 Operating Lease and       Software License Obligations     (2) 143.9 169.9 79.0 30.5 - 423.3 Purchase Obligations     (3) 262.6 282.6 164.8 - - 710.0 Obligations related to       Unrecognized - - - - 107.2 107.2 Tax Benefits (4) Other long-term liabilities       reflected on our Consolidated Balance       Sheets: Compensation and Benefits       (5) 53.3 122.7 82.7 166.4 27.3 452.4 Acquisition-related       obligations (6) 7.1 - - - - 7.1 Total $ 469.7 $ 594.0 $ 330.1 $ 214.3 $ 134.5 $ 1,742.6 (1) These amounts represent the principal repayments of our debt and       are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 12 to the       consolidated financial statements for additional information about our       debt and related matters. The estimated interest payments due by       corresponding period above are $1.1 million, $2.2 million, $2.1 million,       and $2.6 million, respectively, which have been excluded.
(2) Included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment       leases and software license agreements. We enter into operating leases in       the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment, as       well as the licensing of software. The majority of our lease agreements       have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Certain facility       and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes       and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price       indices. Our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit       certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease       agreements.
(3) Purchase obligations primarily relate to purchase and maintenance       agreements on our software, equipment and other assets.
(4) We made the determination that net cash payments expected to be       paid within the next 12 months, related to unrecognized tax benefits of       $107.2 million at June 30, 2010, are expected to be zero. We are unable to       make reasonably reliable estimates as to the period beyond the next 12       months in which cash payments related to unrecognized tax benefits are       expected to be paid.
(5) Compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated       with our employee benefit plans and other compensation     arrangements.
(6) Acquisition-related obligations relate to contingent consideration       for business acquisitions for which the amount of contingent consideration       was determinable at the date of acquisition and therefore included on the       Consolidated Balance Sheet as a liability.
In addition to the obligations quantified in the table above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services. As of June 30, 2010, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2011, total $18,136.7 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We had $18,832.6 million of cash and marketable securities that have been impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2010.
The Companys wholly owned subsidiary, ADP Indemnity, Inc., provides workers compensation and employer liability insurance coverage for our PEO worksite employees. We have secured specific per occurrence and aggregate stop loss reinsurance from third-party carriers that cap losses that reach a certain level in each policy year. We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the PEO business. In fiscal 2010 and 2009, the net premium was $67.8 million and $60.8 million, respectively. In fiscal 2010 and 2009, we paid claims of $53.8 million and $43.6 million, respectively. At June 30, 2010, our cash and marketable securities included balances totaling approximately $208.6 million to cover the actuarially estimated cost of workers compensation claims for the policy years that the PEO worksite employees were covered by ADP Indemnity, Inc.
In the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. We do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.
30 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and long-term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees).
Our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities. These assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury and/or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes. All of our short-term and long-term fixed-income securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
Our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals. Consistent with those goals, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income. Client funds assets are invested in liquid, investment-grade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents. At June 30, 2010, approximately 79% of the available-for-sale securities categorized as U.S. Treasury and direct obligations of U.S. government agencies were invested in senior, unsecured, non-callable debt directly issued by the Federal Home Loan Banks, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
We utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). As part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client fund obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. We minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such clients obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the clients funds in advance of the timing of payment of such clients obligation. As a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of client fund assets to satisfy all of our client funds obligations.
There are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client fund assets. Such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations. However, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations. We also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $6 billion commercial paper program (rated A-1+ by Standard and Poors and Prime-1 by Moodys, the highest possible credit rating), our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions and available borrowings under our $6 billion committed revolving credit facilities. However, the availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business. In addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below.
We have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments. The minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate bonds is BBB and for asset-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities is AAA. The maximum maturity at time of purchase for BBB rated securities is 5 years, for single A rated securities is 7 years, and for AA rated and AAA rated securities is 10 years. Commercial paper must be rated A1/P1 and, for time deposits, banks must have a Financial Strength Rating of C or better.
31 Details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows: (Dollars in millions) Years ended June 30, 2010 2009 2008 Average investment balances at       cost: Corporate investments $ 3,839.2 $ 3,744.7 $ 3,387.0 Funds held for     clients 15,194.5 15,162.4 15,654.3 Total $ 19,033.7 $ 18,907.1 $ 19,041.3 Average interest rates earned       exclusive of realized gains/ (losses)       on: Corporate investments 2.6 % 3.6 % 4.4 % Funds held for     clients 3.6 % 4.0 % 4.4 % Total 3.4 % 3.9 % 4.4 % Realized gains on       available-for-sale securities $ 15.0 $ 11.4 $ 10.1 Realized losses on       available-for-sale securities (13.4 ) (23.8 ) (11.4 ) Net realized gains/(losses) on       available-for-sale securities $ 1.6 $ (12.4 ) $ (1.3 ) As of June 30: Net unrealized pre-tax gains       on available-for-sale securities $ 710.9 $ 436.6 $ 142.1 Total available-for-sale       securities at fair value $ 15,517.0 $ 14,730.2 $ 15,066.4 Our laddering strategy exposes us to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested. Factors that influence the earnings impact of the interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments. This mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes. The annualized interest rates earned on our entire portfolio decreased by 50 basis points, from 3.9% for fiscal 2009 to 3.4% for fiscal 2010. A hypothetical change in both short-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $9 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending June 30, 2011. A hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $5 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending June 30, 2011.
We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities. We limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily AAA and AA rated securities, as rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors, and for Canadian securities, Dominion Bond Rating Service. At June 30, 2010, approximately 85% of our available-for-sale securities held an AAA or AA rating. In addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than US and Canadian government or government agency securities.
We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes.
During fiscal 2010, we were exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations on U.S. Dollar denominated short-term intercompany amounts payable by a Canadian subsidiary to a U.S. subsidiary of the Company in the amount of $178.6 million U.S. Dollars. In order to manage the exposure related to the foreign exchange fluctuations between the Canadian Dollar and the U.S. Dollar, the Canadian subsidiary entered into a foreign exchange forward contract, which obligated the Canadian subsidiary to buy $178.6 million U.S. dollars at a rate of 1.15 Canadian Dollars to each U.S. Dollar on December 1, 2009. Upon settlement of such contract on December 1, 2009, an additional foreign exchange forward contract was entered into that obligated the Canadian subsidiary to buy $29.4 million U.S. Dollars at a rate of 1.06 Canadian dollars to each U.S. Dollar on February 26, 2010. The net loss on the foreign exchange forward contracts of $15.8 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010 was recognized in earnings in fiscal 2010 and substantially offset the foreign currency mark-to-market gains on the related short-term intercompany amounts payable. The short-term intercompany amounts payable were fully paid by the Canadian subsidiary to the U.S. subsidiary by February 2010.
32 There were no derivative financial instruments outstanding at June 30, 2010, 2009 or 2008.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2009-13, "Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements." ASU 2009-13 modifies the guidance related to accounting for arrangements with multiple deliverables by providing an alternative when vendor specific objective evidence ("VSOE") or third-party evidence ("TPE") does not exist to determine the selling price of a deliverable. The alternative when VSOE or TPE does not exist is the best estimate of the selling price of the deliverable. Consideration for multiple deliverables is then allocated based upon the relative selling price of the deliverables and revenue is recognized as earned for each deliverable. ASU 2009-13 is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, unless the election is made to adopt ASU 2009-13 retrospectively. In either case, early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2009-13 will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-14, "Certain Revenue Arrangements that Include Software Elements" ("ASU 2009-14"). ASU 2009-14 modifies the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude (a) non-software components of tangible products and (b) software components of tangible products that are sold, licensed, or leased with tangible products when the software components and non-software components of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible product's functionality. ASU 2009-14 is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, unless the election is made to adopt ASU 2009-14 retrospectively. In either case, early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2009-14 will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
Revenue Recognition . Our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services ( e.g.
, Employer Services payroll processing fees) as well as investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds and other Employer Services client-related funds. We enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction ( e.g.
, number of payees or number of payrolls processed). Fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Our service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties. Interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services.
We also recognize revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses (e.g., Dealer Services dealer management systems). For a majority of our software sales arrangements, which provide hardware, software licenses, installation and post-contract customer support, revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term, as vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendor-specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition.
We assess collectability of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customers payment history. We do not believe that a change in our assumptions utilized in the collectability determination would result in a material change to revenues as no single customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues.
33 Goodwill . We account for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in accordance with ASC 350-10, which states that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. We perform this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount. If an indicator of impairment exists based upon comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount, we would then compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment, if any. We determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach, which utilizes a discounted cash flow model. In addition, we use comparative market multiples to corroborate our discounted cash flow results. We had $2,383.3 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2010. Given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated earnings.
Income Taxes.
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns ( e.g.
, realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
There is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Specifically, an entitys tax benefits must be more likely than not of being sustained assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements. If a tax position drops below the more likely than not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes. A change in the assessment of the more likely than not standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. As of June 30, 2010 and 2009, the Companys liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $107.2 million and $92.8 million, respectively.
If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. Based on current estimates, settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to $10.0 million in the next twelve months. We do not expect any cash payments related to unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
Stock-Based Compensation.
We measure stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. The binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Determining these assumptions is subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Automatic Data Processing, Inc.
Roseland, New Jersey We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2010. Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2. These consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

39 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A. Consolidation and Basis of Preparation.
The consolidated financial statements include the financial results of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiaries (the Company or ADP). Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
B. Description of Business.
The Company is a provider of technology-based outsourcing solutions to employers and vehicle retailers and manufacturers. The Company classifies its operations into the following reportable segments: Employer Services, Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services, and Dealer Services. The primary components of the Other segment are miscellaneous processing services, such as customer financing transactions, non-recurring gains and losses and certain expenses that have not been charged to the reportable segments, such as stock-based compensation expense.
C. Revenue Recognition.
Revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services ( e.g., Employer Services payroll processing fees) as well as investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds and other Employer Services client-related funds. The Company enters into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction ( e.g., number of payees or number of payrolls processed). Fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties.
Interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services.
The Company also recognizes revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses (e.g., Dealer Services dealer management systems). For a majority of our software sales arrangements, which provide hardware, software licenses, installation and post-contract customer support, revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term, as vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist.
The Company assesses collectability of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customers payment history.
PEO revenues are reported on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings and are reported net of direct pass-through costs, which are costs billed and incurred for PEO worksite employees, primarily consisting of payroll wages and payroll taxes. Benefits, workers compensation and state unemployment tax fees for PEO worksite employees are included in PEO revenues and the associated costs are included in operating expenses.
D. Cash and Cash Equivalents.
Investment securities with a maturity of ninety days or less at the time of purchase are considered cash equivalents. The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates carrying value.
E. Corporate Investments and Funds Held for Clients.
All of the Companys marketable securities are considered to be available-for-sale and, accordingly, are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities are determined on a specific-identification basis and are included in other income, net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.
If the fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost, the Company assesses whether it intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery. If either of those two conditions were met, the Company would recognize a charge in earnings equal to the entire difference between the securitys amortized cost basis and its fair value. If the Company does not intend to sell a security or it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, the unrealized loss is separated into an amount representing the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other factors, which is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.
40 Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related available-for-sale security as an adjustment to yield using the effective-interest method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
F. Long-term Receivables.
Long-term receivables relate to notes receivable from the sale of computer systems, primarily to automotive, truck and powersports and truck dealers. Unearned income from finance receivables represents the excess of gross receivables over the sales price of the computer systems financed. Unearned income is amortized using the effective-interest method to maintain a constant rate of return over the term of each contract.
The allowance for doubtful accounts on long-term receivables is the Companys best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses related to the Companys existing note receivables.
G. Property, Plant and Equipment.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. The estimated useful lives of assets are primarily as follows: Data processing       equipment 2 to 5 years Buildings 20 to 40 years Furniture and     fixtures 3 to 7   years H. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are instead tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. The Company performs this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount. If an indicator of impairment exists based upon comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount, the Company would then compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment, if any. The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units using the income approach, which utilizes a discounted cash flow model. In addition, the Company uses comparative market multiples to corroborate its discounted cash flow results.
I. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.
J. Foreign Currency Translation.
The net assets of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect for each period, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in the periods. Gains or losses from balance sheet translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Currency transaction gains or losses, which are included in the results of operations, are immaterial for all periods presented.
K. Derivative Financial Instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and are recognized as assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in the fair value of the derivatives recognized in either net earnings from continuing operations or accumulated other comprehensive income, depending on the timing and designated purpose of the derivative.
There were no derivative financial instruments outstanding at June 30, 2010 or June 30, 2009.
41 L. Earnings per Share (EPS).
The calculations of basic and diluted EPS are as follows: Effect of Effect of Effect of Employee Employee Employee Stock Option Stock Purchase Restricted Stock Years ended       June 30, Basic Shares Plan Shares Shares Diluted 2010 Net earnings from continuing       operations $ 1,207.3 $ - $ - $ - $ 1,207.3 Weighted average shares (in       millions) 500.5 2.2 - 1.0 503.7 EPS from       continuing operations $ 2.41 $ 2.40 2009 Net earnings from continuing       operations $ 1,325.1 $ - $ - $ - $ 1,325.1 Weighted average shares (in       millions) 503.2 1.2 - 1.4 505.8 EPS from       continuing operations $ 2.63 $ 2.62 2008 Net earnings from continuing       operations $ 1,155.7 $ - $ - $ - $ 1,155.7 Weighted average shares (in       millions) 521.5 4.3 0.3 1.1 527.2 EPS from       continuing operations $ 2.22 $ 2.19 Options to purchase 14.0 million, 32.9 million, and 12.6 million shares of common stock for the year ended June 30, 2010 (fiscal 2010), the year ended June 30, 2009 (fiscal 2009) and the year ended June 30, 2008 (fiscal 2008), respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their exercise prices exceeded the average market price of outstanding common shares for the respective fiscal year.
M. Stock-Based Compensation.
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense in net earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant. The Company determines the fair value of stock options issued using a binomial option-pricing model. The binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of the Companys stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of a stock option grant is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
N. Internal Use Software.
Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a three- to five-year period on a straight-line basis. For software developed or obtained for internal use, the Company capitalizes costs. The Companys policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. In addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. The Company also expenses internal costs related to minor upgrades and enhancements, as it is impractical to separate these costs from normal maintenance activities.
O. Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed.
The Company capitalizes certain costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed. The Companys policy provides for the capitalization of all software production costs upon reaching technological feasibility for a specific product. Technological feasibility is attained when software products have a completed working model whose consistency with the overall product design has been confirmed by testing. Costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. The establishment of technological feasibility requires judgment by management and in many instances is only attained a short time prior to the general release of the software. Upon the general release of the software product to customers, capitalization ceases and such costs are amortized over a three-year period on a straight-line basis. Maintenance-related costs are expensed as incurred.
P. Income Taxes.
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. The Company is subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities.
42 There is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Specifically, it clarifies that an entitys tax benefits must be more likely than not of being sustained, assuming that these positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements. If a tax position drops below the more likely than not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes. As of June 30, 2010 and 2009, the Companys liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $107.2 million and $92.8 million, respectively.
If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. Based on current estimates, settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to $10.0 million. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
Q. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.
In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2009-13, Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. ASU 2009-13 modifies the guidance related to accounting for arrangements with multiple deliverables by providing an alternative when vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) or third-party evidence (TPE) does not exist to determine the selling price of a deliverable. The alternative when VSOE or TPE does not exist is the best estimate of the selling price of the deliverable. Consideration for multiple deliverables is then allocated based upon the relative selling price of the deliverables and revenue is recognized as earned for each deliverable. ASU 2009-13 is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, unless the election is made to adopt ASU 2009-13 retrospectively. In either case, early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2009-13 will not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-14, Certain Revenue Arrangements that Include Software Elements (ASU 2009-14). ASU 2009-14 modifies the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude (a) non-software components of tangible products and (b) software components of tangible products that are sold, licensed, or leased with tangible products when the software components and non-software components of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible products functionality. ASU 2009-14 is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, unless the election is made to adopt ASU 2009-14 retrospectively. In either case, early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2009-14 will not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations were recorded on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the respective acquisition dates based upon their estimated fair values at such dates. The results of operations of businesses acquired by the Company have been included in the Statements of Consolidated Earnings since their respective dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill. In certain circumstances, the allocations of the excess purchase price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions. Accordingly, the allocations are subject to revision when the Company receives final information, including appraisals and other analyses, which typically occurs within one year from the date of acquisition.

48 Approximately 85% of the available-for-sale securities held an AAA or AA rating at June 30, 2010, as rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors and, for Canadian securities, Dominion Bond Rating Service. All available-for-sale securities were rated as investment grade at June 30, 2010.
The amount of collected but not yet remitted funds for the Companys payroll and payroll tax filing and other services varies significantly during the fiscal year, and averaged approximately $15,194.5 million, $15,162.4 million and $15,654.3 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
The unrealized losses and fair values of available-for-sale securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for a period of less than and greater than 12 months as of June 30, 2010 are as follows: Unrealized Unrealized losses Fair market losses Fair market Total gross less than value less than greater than value greater unrealized Total fair 12       months 12       months 12       months than 12 months losses market value U.S. Treasury and direct       obligations of U.S. government     agencies $ - $ 28.0 $ (0.2 ) $ 6.5 $ (0.2 ) $ 34.5 Corporate bonds (9.0 ) 210.5 - - (9.0 ) 210.5 Asset backed     securities - 2.4 - - - 2.4 Other securities (1.0 ) 22.7 - - (1.0 ) 22.7 $ (10.0 ) $ 263.6 $ (0.2 ) $ 6.5 $ (10.2 ) $ 270.1 Expected maturities of available-for-sale securities at June 30, 2010 are as follows: Maturity Dates: Due in one year or     less $ 2,796.6 Due after one year up to two       years 3,268.0 Due after two years up to       three years 3,346.7 Due after three years up to       four years 1,795.9 Due after four years 4,309.8 Total available-for-sale       securities $ 15,517.0 The Company had an investment in a money market fund called the Reserve Fund. During the quarter ended September 30, 2008, the net asset value of the Reserve Fund decreased below $1 per share as a result of the full write-off of the Reserve Funds holdings in debt securities issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc., which filed for bankruptcy protection on September 15, 2008. In fiscal 2009, the Company reclassified $211.1 million of its investment from cash and cash equivalents to short-term marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet due to the fact that these assets no longer met the definition of a cash equivalent. Additionally, the Company reflected the impact of such reclassification on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows for fiscal 2009 as reclassification from cash equivalents to short-term marketable securities. During fiscal 2009, the Company recorded an $18.3 million loss to other income, net, on the Statement of Consolidated Earnings to recognize its pro-rata share of the estimated losses of the Reserve Fund. During fiscal 2010, the Company had received distributions in excess of what was previously recognized in short-term marketable securities, net of previously recognized losses, in the amount of $15.2 million. As such, in fiscal 2010, the Company recorded a gain of $15.2 million to other income, net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.
At September 30, 2009 and June 30, 2010, the Company concluded that it had the intent to sell certain securities for which unrealized losses of $5.3 million and $9.1 million, respectively, were previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As such, the Company realized impairment losses of $14.4 million in other income, net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings in fiscal 2010.
49 For the securities in an unrealized loss position of $10.2 million at June 30, 2010, the Company concluded that it did not have the intent to sell such securities and that it was not more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell such securities before recovery. At June 30, 2010, the Company evaluated the unrealized losses of $10.2 million related to the debt securities in an unrealized loss position, for which the Company did not have the intent to sell such securities and that it was not more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell such securities before recovery, in order to determine whether such losses were due to credit losses. The securities with unrealized losses of $10.2 million were primarily comprised of corporate bonds. The Company evaluated such securities utilizing a variety of quantitative and qualitative factors including whether the Company expects to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the security, information about current and past events of the issuer, and the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost basis. At June 30, 2010, the Company concluded that unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities held at June 30, 2010 were not credit losses and were attributable to other factors, including changes in interest rates. As a result, the Company concluded that the $10.2 million in unrealized losses on such securities should be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2010.
NOTE 6. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS On July 1, 2008, the Company adopted ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures for assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. On July 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC 820-10 for non-financial assets that are recognized or disclosed on a non-recurring basis. The guidance in ASC 820-10 clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the disclosures on fair value measurements. ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. ASC 820-10 establishes market or observable inputs as the preferred source of fair value, followed by assumptions based on hypothetical transactions in the absence of market inputs.
In January 2010, the Company adopted ASU 2010-6. The guidance in ASU 2010-6 amends the disclosure requirements in ASC 820.10 and requires new disclosures regarding transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 asset categories as well as more detailed information for the Level 3 reconciliation of activity, if required. Since we adopted ASC 820.10, we have not had any transfers in or out of Level 1 or Level 2, nor have we had any Level 3 assets or liabilities. ASU 2010-6 also clarifies existing disclosure requirements regarding the level of disaggregation expected, valuation techniques and inputs to fair value measurements.
The valuation techniques required by ASC 820-10 are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest priority.
Level 1 Fair value is determined based       upon closing prices for identical instruments that are traded on active       exchanges.
Level 2 Fair value is determined based       upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted       prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not       active; or model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose       significant value drivers are observable.
Level 3 Fair value is determined based       upon significant inputs to the valuation model that are       unobservable.
Available-for-sale securities included in Level 1 are valued using closing prices for identical instruments that are traded on active exchanges. Available-for-sale securities included in Level 2 are valued utilizing inputs obtained from an independent pricing service. To determine the fair value of our Level 2 investments, a variety of inputs are utilized, including benchmark yields, reported trades, non-binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, new issue data, and monthly payment information. Over 99% of our Level 2 investments are valued utilizing inputs obtained from a pricing service. The Company reviews the values generated by the independent pricing service for reasonableness by comparing the valuations received from the independent pricing service to valuations from at least one other observable source. The Company has not adjusted the prices obtained from the independent pricing service. The Company has no available-for-sale securities included in Level 3.
50 The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the classification of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy. In certain instances, the inputs used to measure fair value may meet the definition of more than one level of the fair value hierarchy. The significant input with the lowest level priority is used to determine the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy.
The following table presents the Companys assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2010. Included in the table are available-for-sale securities within corporate investments of $132.2 million and funds held for clients of $15,384.8 million. Refer to Note 5 for additional disclosure in relation to corporate investments and funds held for clients.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET Changes in goodwill for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 are as follows : Employer PEO Dealer Services Services Services Total Balance as of June 30,       2008 $ 1,615.7 $ 4.8 $ 806.2 $ 2,426.7 Additions and other       adjustments, net 4.5 - 67.0 71.5 Currency translation       adjustments (53.2 ) - (69.5 ) (122.7 ) Balance as of June 30,       2009 $ 1,567.0 $ 4.8 $ 803.7 $ 2,375.5 Additions and other       adjustments, net 80.6 - 1.4 82.0 Adjustments for discontinued       operations - - (15.0 ) (15.0 ) Currency translation       adjustments (36.3 ) - (22.9 ) (59.2 ) Balance as of June 30,       2010 $ 1,611.3 $ 4.8 $ 767.2 $ 2,383.3 In fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company performed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill and determined that there was no impairment.
52 Components of intangible assets are as follows: June 30, 2010 2009 Intangibles: Software and software       licenses $ 1,160.0 $ 1,085.0 Customer contracts and       lists 640.3 621.9 Other intangibles 209.5 197.3 2,009.8 1,904.2 Less accumulated       amortization: Software and software       licenses (946.0 ) (858.5 ) Customer contracts and       lists (375.6 ) (328.6 ) Other intangibles (145.8 ) (138.4 ) (1,467.4 ) (1,325.5 ) Intangible assets,     net $ 542.4 $ 578.7 Other intangibles consist primarily of purchased rights, covenants, patents and trademarks (acquired directly or through acquisitions). All of the intangible assets have finite lives and, as such, are subject to amortization. The weighted average remaining useful life of the intangible assets is 6 years (3 years for software and software licenses, 8 years for customer contracts and lists, and 7 years for other intangibles). Amortization of intangible assets was $156.6 million, $151.9 million and $152.0 million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Estimated amortization expenses of the Companys existing intangible assets for the next five fiscal years are as follows: Twelve months ending June 30,       2011 $ 157.2 Twelve months ending June 30,       2012 $ 126.5 Twelve months ending June 30,       2013 $ 65.5 Twelve months ending June 30,       2014 $ 50.6 Twelve months ending June 30,       2015 $ 39.2 The Company has not incurred significant costs to renew or extend the term of acquired intangible assets during fiscal 2010.
NOTE 11. SHORT-TERM FINANCING In June 2010, the Company entered into a $2.5 billion, 364-day credit agreement with a group of lenders. The 364-day facility replaced the Companys prior $2.25 billion 364-day facility. In addition, the Company entered into a three-year $1.5 billion credit facility maturing in June 2013 that contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500.0 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The three-year facility replaced our prior $1.5 billion five-year facility, which expired in June 2010. The Company also has an existing $2.25 billion five-year credit facility that matures in June 2011 that also contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500.0 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The interest rate applicable to the committed borrowings is tied to LIBOR, the federal funds effective rate or the prime rate depending on the notification provided by the Company to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing. The Company is also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and to provide funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. The Company had no borrowings through June 30, 2010 under the credit agreements.
The Companys U.S. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained through a short-term commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $6.0 billion in aggregate maturity value of commercial paper. In August 2010, the Company increased the U.S. short-term commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to $6.25 billion in aggregate maturity value. The Companys commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poors and Prime-1 by Moodys. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. At June 30, 2010, the Company had no commercial paper outstanding. At June 30, 2009, the Company had $0.7 billion in commercial paper outstanding. Such amount was repaid on July 1, 2009. In fiscal 2010 and 2009, the Companys average borrowings were $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.2% and 1.0%, respectively. The weighted average maturity of the Companys commercial paper in fiscal 2010 and 2009 was less than two days for both fiscal years.
53 The Companys U.S. and Canadian short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements. These agreements are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. The Company has $2 billion available to it on a committed basis under these reverse repurchase agreements. At June 30, 2010 and 2009, there were no outstanding obligations under reverse repurchase agreements. In fiscal 2010 and 2009, the Company had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of $425.0 million and $425.9 million, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 0.2% and 1.3%, respectively.
NOTE 12. DEBT Components of long-term debt are as follows: June 30, 2010 2009 Industrial revenue     bonds (with variable interest rates       from 0.4% to 1.1%) $ 25.4 $ 26.5 Secured financing 17.2 19.0 Other - - 42.6 45.5 Less: current portion (2.8 ) (2.8 ) $ 39.8 $ 42.7 During fiscal 2008, the Company entered into a secured financing agreement, whereby the Company borrowed $21.1 million from a third party in exchange for a security interest in a single clients unbilled accounts receivable, which is billable over a ten-year period. The Company will continue to collect amounts due from the client as they are billed. The security interest in the receivables retained by the third party is without recourse against the Company in the event that the client does not make the appropriate payments to the Company. As of June 30, 2010, the Company has recorded approximately $2.8 million within accrued expenses and other current liabilities and approximately $14.4 million within long-term debt on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the secured financing arrangement.
The fair value of the industrial revenue bonds and other debt, included above, approximates carrying value.
Long-term debt repayments at June 30, 2010 are due as follows: 2012 $ 1.7 2013 17.1 2014 1.8 2015 1.8 2016 1.8 Thereafter 15.6 $ 39.8 Cash payments relating to interest on long-term debt and the short-term financing arrangements described in Note 11 were approximately $8.9 million, $40.1 million, and $82.1 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
NOTE 13. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company uses derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes.
54 During fiscal 2010, the Company was exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations on U.S. Dollar denominated short-term intercompany amounts payable by a Canadian subsidiary to a U.S. subsidiary of the Company in the amount of $178.6 million U.S. Dollars. In order to manage the exposure related to the foreign exchange fluctuations between the Canadian Dollar and the U.S. Dollar, the Canadian subsidiary entered into a foreign exchange forward contract, which obligated the Canadian subsidiary to buy $178.6 million U.S. dollars at a rate of 1.15 Canadian Dollars to each U.S. Dollar on December 1, 2009. Upon settlement of such contract on December 1, 2009, an additional foreign exchange forward contract was entered into that obligated the Canadian subsidiary to buy $29.4 million U.S. Dollars at a rate of 1.06 Canadian dollars to each U.S. Dollar on February 26, 2010. The net loss on the foreign exchange forward contracts of $15.8 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010 was recognized in earnings in fiscal 2010 and substantially offset the foreign currency mark-to-market gains and losses on the related short-term intercompany amounts payable. The short-term intercompany amounts payable were fully paid by the Canadian subsidiary to the U.S. subsidiary by February 2010.
There were no derivative financial instruments outstanding at June 30, 2010, 2009 or 2008.
NOTE 14. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS A. Stock Plans.
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense in net earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation consists of the following: Stock Options.
Stock options are granted to   employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Companys   common stock on the dates of grant. Stock options are issued under a grade   vesting schedule. Options granted prior to July 1, 2008 generally vest ratably   over five years and have a term of 10 years. Options granted after July 1, 2008   generally vest ratably over four years and have a term of 10 years.   Compensation expense for stock options is recognized over the requisite   service period for each separately vesting portion of the stock option   award.
Employee Stock Purchase   Plan.
Prior to January 1,   2009, the Company offered an employee stock purchase plan that allowed   eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price equal to 85%   of the market value for the common stock at the date the purchase price for   the offering was determined. No further compensation expense related to this   stock purchase plan was recorded after completion of the vesting period of the   final offering under such plan on December 31, 2009.
Subsequent to June 30, 2009, the Company offers an employee stock purchase   plan that allows eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock at a   price equal to 95% of the market value for the Companys common stock on the   last day of the offering period. This plan has been deemed non-compensatory   and therefore, no compensation expense has been recorded.
Restricted Stock.
Time-Based Restricted   Stock.
The   Company has issued time-based restricted stock to certain key employees. These   shares are restricted as to transfer and in certain circumstances must be   returned to the Company at the original purchase price. The Company records   stock compensation expense relating to the issuance of restricted stock based   on market prices on the date of grant on a straight-line basis over the period   in which the transfer restrictions exist, which is up to five years from the   date of grant.
Performance-Based   Restricted Stock.
The   performance-based restricted stock programs have either a one-year or two-year   performance period, and a subsequent six-month service period. Under these   programs, the Company   communicates target awards to employees at the beginning of a performance   period and, as such, dividends are not paid in respect of the target awards   during the performance period. After the performance period, if the   performance targets are achieved, associates are eligible to receive dividends   on any shares awarded under the program. The performance target is based on   EPS growth over the performance period, with possible payouts ranging from 0%   to 125% of the target awards. Stock-based compensation expense is measured   based upon the fair value of the award on the grant date. Compensation expense   is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting terms of approximately   18 months and 30 months, for the one-year and two-year plans, respectively,   based upon the probability the performance target will be met.
55 The Company currently utilizes treasury stock to satisfy stock option exercises, issuances under the Companys employee stock purchase plan and restricted stock awards. Stock-based compensation expense of $67.6 million, $96.0 million and $123.6 million was recognized in earnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as well as related tax benefits of $22.3 million, $27.6 million and $37.0 million, respectively.
Years ended June 30, 2010 2009 2008 Operating expenses $ 11.7 $ 20.6 $ 25.4 Selling, general and       administrative expenses 45.9 60.4 76.7 System development and       programming costs 10.0 15.0 21.5 Total pretax stock-based       compensation expense $ 67.6 $ 96.0 $ 123.6 As of June 30, 2010, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options and restricted stock awards amounted to $14.4 million and $37.6 million, respectively, which will both be amortized over the weighted average remaining requisite service periods of 1.6 years.
In fiscal 2010, the following activity occurred under our existing plans: Stock Options: Number of Options Weighted Average     Price (in thousands) (in dollars) Years ended June 30, 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Options outstanding, beginning of year 45,320 49,127 53,786 $ 41 $ 41 $ 40 Options granted 1,265 1,390 2,047 $ 40 $ 39 $ 41 Options exercised (6,154 ) (2,502 ) (5,068 ) $ 37 $ 36 $ 34 Options canceled (5,431 ) (2,695 ) (1,638 ) $ 44 $ 41 $ 43 Options outstanding, end of       year 35,000 45,320 49,127 $ 41 $ 41 $ 41 Options exercisable, end of       year 29,781 37,318 36,653 $ 41 $ 41 $ 41 Shares available for future       grants, end of year 28,270 24,104 22,799 Shares reserved for issuance       under stock option plans, end of       year 63,270 69,424 71,926 Performance-Based Restricted Stock: Number of Shares (in thousands) Years ended June 30, 2010 2009 2008 Restricted shares       outstanding, beginning of year 2,632 2,928 1,711 Restricted shares       granted 1,129 1,850 1,487 Restricted shares     vested (1,327 ) (1,988 ) (122 ) Restricted shares forfeited       (a) (1,322 ) (158 ) (148 ) Restricted shares outstanding,       end of year 1,112 2,632 2,928 (a) Shares       forfeited for the year ended June 30, 2010 includes 1.1 million shares       that were forfeited in fiscal 2010 due to performance targets not being       met.
56 The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding and exercisable as of June 30, 2010 was $52.9 million and $50.2 million, respectively, and the aggregate intrinsic value for stock options exercised in fiscal 2010 was $29.1 million.
Summarized information about stock options outstanding as of June 30, 2010 is as follows: Outstanding Exercisable Weighted Weighted Exercise Number Remaining Average Number Remaining Average Price of Options Life Price of Options Life Price Range (in       thousands) (in       years) (in       dollars) (in       thousands) (in       years) (in       dollars) Under $25 - - $ - - - $ - $25 to $35 2,370 2.6 $ 31 2,370 2.6 $ 31 $35 to $45 26,130 4.6 $ 40 21,232 3.9 $ 40 $45 to $55 6,500 1.4 $ 50 6,179 1.1 $ 50 35,000 3.9 $ 41 29,781 3.3 $ 41 In fiscal 2010, the Company issued 1.4 million shares in connection with the final compensatory employee stock purchase plan offering that vested on December 31, 2009.
The fair value of each stock option issued prior to January 1, 2005 was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For stock options issued on or after January 1, 2005, the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option pricing model. The binomial model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of the Companys stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grant is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
The fair value for stock options granted was estimated at the date of grant with the following assumptions: Years ended June 30, 2010 2009 2008 Risk-free interest     rate 2.3% - 2.6% 1.8% - 3.1% 2.8% - 4.6% Dividend yield 3.2% - 3.4% 2.6% - 3.5% 1.7% - 2.7% Weighted average volatility       factor 25.9% - 30.4% 25.3% - 31.3% 22.8% - 25.6% Weighted average expected life       (in years) 5.0 - 5.1 5.0 5.0 The weighted average fair values of stock plan issuances were as follows (in dollars): Years ended June 30, 2010 2009 2008 Stock options $ 7.05 $ 7.54 $ 8.31 Stock purchase plan $ - $ - $ 11.99 Performance-based restricted       stock $ 41.95 $ 39.04 $ 44.61 B. Pension Plans.
The Company has a defined benefit cash balance pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees, under which employees are credited with a percentage of base pay plus interest. The plan interest credit rate will vary from year-to-year based on the ten-year U.S. Treasury rate. Employees are fully vested on completion of three years of service. The Company's policy is to make contributions within the range determined by generally accepted actuarial principles. In addition, the Company has various retirement plans for its non-U.S. employees and maintains a Supplemental Officers Retirement Plan (SORP). The SORP is a defined benefit plan pursuant to which the Company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key officers upon retirement based upon the officers years of service and compensation.
57 A June 30 measurement date was used in determining the Companys benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets.
ASC 715-10 requires a company to (a) recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plans overfunded status or a liability for a plans underfunded status, (b) measure a plans assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employers fiscal year, and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit plan in the year in which the changes occur in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
The Companys pension plans funded status as of June 30, 2010 and 2009 is as follows : June 30, 2010 2009 Change in plan     assets: Fair value of plan assets at       beginning of year $ 787.0 $ 952.2 Actual return on plan       assets 117.6 (144.3 ) Employer     contributions 112.3 6.3 Benefits paid (35.2 ) (27.2 ) Fair value of plan assets at       end of year $ 981.7 $ 787.0 Change in benefit       obligation: Benefit obligation at       beginning of year $ 894.9 $ 842.8 Service cost 47.6 46.2 Interest cost 59.1 56.7 Actuarial and other       gains 121.5 (23.6 ) Benefits paid (35.2 ) (27.2 ) Projected benefit obligation       at end of year $ 1,087.9 $ 894.9 Funded status - plan assets       less benefit obligations $ (106.2 ) $ (107.9 ) The amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2010 and 2009 consisted of: June 30, 2010 2009 Noncurrent assets $ - $ 1.0 Current liabilities (3.9 ) (4.4 ) Noncurrent     liabilities (102.3 ) (104.5 ) Net amount recognized $ (106.2 ) $ (107.9 ) The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $1,078.5 million and $887.4 million at June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
The Companys pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of June 30, 2010 and 2009 had the following projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets: June 30, 2010 2009 Projected benefit       obligation $ 1,054.4 $ 870.8 Accumulated benefit       obligation $ 1,048.3 $ 865.7 Fair value of plan       assets $ 951.0 $ 762.0 58 The components of net pension expense were as follows: Years ended June 30, 2010 2009 2008 Service cost - benefits       earned during the period $ 47.6 $ 46.2 $ 46.1 Interest cost on projected       benefits 59.1 56.7 50.7 Expected return on plan       assets (76.5 ) (70.3 ) (67.2 ) Net amortization and       deferral 4.5 1.2 10.4 $ 34.7 $ 33.8 $ 40.0 The net actuarial and other loss, transition obligation and prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost are $410.0 million, $1.1 million and $7.6 million, respectively, at June 30, 2010. The estimated net actuarial and other loss, transition obligation and prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $19.4 million, $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively, at June 30, 2010.
Assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of benefit obligations were: Years ended June 30, 2010 2009 Discount rate 5.25% 6.80% Increase in compensation       levels 5.50% 5.50% Assumptions used to determine the net pension expense generally were: Years ended June 30, 2010 2009 2008 Discount rate 6.80% 6.95% 6.25% Expected long-term rate of       return on assets 7.25% 7.25% 7.25% Increase in compensation       levels 5.50% 5.50% 5.50% The discount rate is based upon published rates for high-quality fixed-income investments that produce cash flows that approximate the timing and amount of expected future benefit payments.
The long-term expected rate of return on assets assumption is 7.25%. This percentage has been determined based on historical and expected future rates of return on plan assets considering the target asset mix and the long-term investment strategy.
Plan Assets The Companys pension plans asset allocations at June 30, 2010 and 2009 by asset category were as follows: 2010 2009 United States Fixed Income       Securities 37% 37% United States Equity       Securities 42% 47% International Securities 21% 16% Total 100% 100% The Companys pension plans asset investment strategy is designed to ensure prudent management of assets, consistent with long-term return objectives and the prompt fulfillment of all pension plan obligations. The investment strategy and asset mix were developed in coordination with an asset liability study conducted by external consultants to maximize the funded ratio with the least amount of volatility.
59 The pension plans assets are currently invested in various asset classes with differing expected rates of return, correlations and volatilities, including large capitalization and small capitalization U.S. equities, international equities, and U.S. fixed income securities and cash.
The target asset allocation ranges are as follows: United States Fixed Income       Securities 35  45% United States Equity       Securities 37  50% International Equity       Securities 12  20% The pension plans fixed income portfolio is designed to match the duration and liquidity characteristics of the pension plans liabilities. In addition, the pension plans invest only in investment-grade debt securities to ensure preservation of capital. The pension plans equity portfolios are subject to diversification guidelines to reduce the impact of losses in single investments. Investment managers are prohibited from buying or selling commodities and from the short selling of securities.
None of the pension plans assets are directly invested in the Companys stock, although the pension plans may hold a minimal amount of Company stock to the extent of the Companys participation in the S&P 500 Index.
Plan investments included in Level 1 are valued using closing prices for identical instruments that are traded on active exchanges. Plan investments included in Level 2 are valued utilizing inputs obtained from an independent pricing service, which are reviewed by the Company for reasonableness. To determine the fair value of our Level 2 plan assets, a variety of inputs are utilized, including benchmark yields, reported trades, non-binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, new issue data, and monthly payment information. The Plan has no Level 3 investments at June 30, 2010.
The following table presents the investments of the pension plans measured at fair value at June 30, 2010: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Comingled trusts $ - $ 357.1 $ - $ 357.1 U.S. Government       securities - 191.3 - 191.3 Mutual funds 252.1 - - 252.1 Corporate and municipal       bonds - 160.1 - 160.1 Mortgage-backed security       bonds - 0.7 - 0.7 Total pension assets $ 252.1 $ 709.2 $ - $ 961.3 In addition to the investments of the pension plans of $961.3 million in the above table, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of the pension plans of $20.4 million as of June 30, 2010.
Contributions During July 2010, the Company contributed $150.0 million to the pension plans. In addition to this contribution, the Company expects to contribute approximately $7.6 million to the pension plans during fiscal 2011.
Estimated Future Benefit Payments The benefits expected to be paid in each year from fiscal 2011 to 2015 are $55.0 million, $55.5 million, $62.2 million, $67.7 million and $75.3 million, respectively. The aggregate benefits expected to be paid in the five fiscal years from 2016 to 2020 are $509.1 million. The expected benefits to be paid are based on the same assumptions used to measure the Companys pension plans benefit obligation at June 30, 2010 and includes estimated future employee service.
C. Retirement and Savings Plan.
The Company has a 401(k) retirement and savings plan, which allows eligible employees to contribute up to 35% of their compensation annually and allows highly compensated employees to contribute up to 10% of their compensation annually. The Company matches a portion of employee contributions, which amounted to approximately $55.8 million, $52.1 million, and $49.0 million for calendar years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

There are $84.5 million and $44.1 million of long-term deferred tax assets included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There are $48.1 million and $23.0 million of current deferred tax liabilities included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
62 Income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in an aggregate amount of approximately $938.7 million as of June 30, 2010, as the Company considers such earnings to be permanently reinvested outside of the United States. The additional U.S. income tax that would arise on repatriation of the remaining undistributed earnings could be offset, in part, by foreign tax credits on such repatriation. However, it is impractical to estimate the amount of net income and, as a result, the amount of withholding tax that might be payable.
The Company has estimated foreign net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $107.2 million as of June 30, 2010, of which $26.2 million expires in 2011 through 2030 and $81.0 million has an indefinite utilization period. In addition, the Company has estimated Federal net operating loss carry-forwards of acquired companies of approximately $17.0 million as of June 30, 2010, which expire in 2011 through 2027. There is an annual limitation pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 382 on the utilization of the Federal net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $8.8 million per year. The Company has estimated state net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $213.9 million as of June 30, 2010, which expire in 2011 through 2029.
The Company has recorded valuation allowances of $61.9 million and $51.7 million at June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, to reflect the estimated amount of domestic and foreign deferred tax assets that may not be realized. A portion of the valuation allowance in the amount of approximately $2.9 million at June 30, 2009 relates to net deferred tax assets, which were recorded in purchase accounting as a reduction to goodwill. A portion of the valuation allowance in the amount of $4.3 million at June 30, 2010 relates to net deferred tax assets, which were recorded to our provision for income taxes on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.
Income tax payments were approximately $693.4 million, $719.1 million, and $755.7 million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
As of June 30, 2010 and 2009, the Companys liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $107.2 million and $92.8 million, respectively. The amount that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate is $52.8 million and $42.0 million, respectively. The remainder, if recognized, would principally affect deferred taxes.
63 A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: Unrecognized tax benefits at       July 1, 2007 $ 350.2 Additions for tax positions of       the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 23.6 Reductions for tax positions       of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 - Additions for tax positions of       periods prior to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 43.2 Reductions for tax positions       of periods prior to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 (11.5 ) Settlements with tax       authorities (1.1 ) Expiration of the statute of       limitations (4.0 ) Impact of foreign exchange       rate fluctuations 3.8 Unrecognized tax benefits at       June 30, 2008 $ 404.2 Unrecognized tax benefits at       July 1, 2008 $ 404.2 Additions for tax positions of       the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 19.0 Reductions for tax positions       of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 (6.4 ) Additions for tax positions of       periods prior to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 111.4 Reductions for tax positions       of periods prior to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 (207.7 ) Settlements with tax       authorities (216.9 ) Expiration of the statute of       limitations (3.5 ) Impact of foreign exchange       rate fluctuations (7.3 ) Unrecognized tax benefits at       June 30, 2009 $ 92.8 Unrecognized tax benefits at       July 1, 2009 $ 92.8 Additions for tax positions of       the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 13.3 Reductions for tax positions       of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 (2.1 ) Additions for tax positions of       periods prior to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 29.6 Reductions for tax positions       of periods prior to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 (1.0 ) Settlements with tax       authorities (5.0 ) Expiration of the statute of       limitations (20.3 ) Impact of foreign exchange       rate fluctuations (0.1 ) Unrecognized tax benefits at       June 30, 2010 $ 107.2 Interest expense and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions have been recorded in the provision for income taxes on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded interest expense of $4.0 million, $15.5 million and $18.4 million, respectively. At June 30, 2010, the Company had accrued interest of $15.3 million recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $0.2 million was recorded within income taxes payable, and the remainder was recorded within other liabilities. At June 30, 2009, the Company had accrued interest of $29.4 million recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was recorded within other liabilities. At June 30, 2010, the Company had accrued penalties of $1.1 million recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was recorded within other liabilities. At June 30, 2009, the Company had accrued penalties of $0.5 million recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was recorded within other liabilities.
The Company is routinely examined by the IRS and tax authorities in foreign countries in which it conducts business, as well as tax authorities in states in which it has significant business operations, such as California, Illinois, Minnesota and New Jersey. The tax years currently under examination vary by jurisdiction. Such examinations currently in progress are as follows: Taxing       Jurisdiction Fiscal Years       under Examination U.S. (IRS) 2009  2010 California 2004 - 2005 Illinois 2004 - 2005 Minnesota 1998 - 2004 New Jersey 2002 - 2006 Province of Alberta 2007 64 Canada has substantially completed its joint audit with the Province of Ontario for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005 through June 30, 2007.
The Company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments resulting from examinations in each of the jurisdictions. The resolution of tax matters is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although a resolution could have a material impact on the Companys Statements of Consolidated Earnings for a particular future period and on the Companys effective tax rate.
If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. Based on current estimates, settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to $10.0 million in the next twelve months. We do not expect any cash payments related to unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
In January 2010, the Company reached an agreement with the IRS regarding all outstanding tax audit issues in dispute for the tax years 2007 and 2008, which did not have a material impact to the effective tax rate.
In June 2009, the Company reached an agreement with the IRS regarding all outstanding tax audit issues with the IRS in dispute for the tax years 1998 through 2006. As a result, the Company owed the IRS and other tax jurisdictions $217.5 million, which was satisfied by applying $113.2 million of funds on deposit and making cash payments of $103.0 million in fiscal 2010. The impact of this agreement was offset by a receivable of $168.1 million from the IRS and other tax jurisdictions, of which $152.3 million was received in fiscal 2010. The remaining balances are expected to be settled in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2009, the Company had previously recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $317.6 million and recorded a benefit to the provision for income taxes of $99.7 million. Additionally, in fiscal 2009, the Company included a cumulative adjustment between domestic and foreign earnings as a result of the audit settlement described above and a related agreement with a foreign tax authority, and as a result, included a foreign tax benefit of $119.7 million in its income tax provision.
In April 2009, the Company settled a state tax matter, for which the Company had previously recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $14.2 million and a related deferred tax asset of $5.1 million. Accordingly, the Company recorded a reduction in the provision for income taxes of $9.2 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 related to the reversal of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and the related deferred tax asset. In addition, the Company received a tax credit of $11.1 million related to the same matter, which further reduced the provision for income taxes during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, the Company recorded a reduction in the provision for income taxes of $12.4 million, which was primarily related to the settlement of a state tax matter, for which the Company had previously recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $7.9 million and a related deferred tax asset of $2.9 million.
During fiscal 2008, the Company recorded a tax-basis adjustment to capital in excess of par value on the Statements of Consolidated Stockholders Equity, which was related to a business that the Company acquired in May 1999 that was accounted for by the Company as a pooling of interests.
65 NOTE 16. CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company has obligations under various facilities and equipment leases and software license agreements. Total expense under these agreements was approximately $175.4 million, $194.2 million, and $170.4 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, with minimum commitments at June 30, 2010 as follows: Years ending June   30, 2011 $ 143.9 2012 101.6 2013 68.3 2014 45.7 2015 33.3 Thereafter 30.5 $ 423.3 In addition to fixed rentals, certain leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices.
As of June 30, 2010, the Company has purchase commitments of approximately $ 710.0 million relating to software and equipment purchases and maintenance contracts, of which $ 262.6 million relates to the fiscal year ending June 30, 2011, $ 158.3 million relates to the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012 and the remaining $ 289.1 million relates to fiscal years ending June 30, 2013 through fiscal 2015.
The Company is subject to various claims and litigation in the normal course of business. The Company does not believe that the resolution of these matters will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
It is not the Companys business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. However, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company uses derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. In the normal course of business, the Company also enters into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Companys services and products. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.
NOTE 17. ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Comprehensive income is a measure of income that includes both net earnings and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) results from items deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in stockholders equity. Other comprehensive income (loss) was $53.5 million, $(120.2) million, and $309.6 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The accumulated balances reported in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for each component of other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows: June 30, 2010 2009 2008 Currency translation       adjustments $ 16.4 $ 92.5 $ 284.6 Unrealized net gain on       available-for-sale securities, net of     tax 457.8 282.4 91.3 Pension liability adjustment,       net of tax (264.7 ) (218.9 ) (99.7 ) Accumulated other       comprehensive income $ 209.5 $ 156.0 $ 276.2 66 NOTE 18. FINANCIAL DATA BY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA Based upon similar economic characteristics and operational characteristics, the Companys strategic business units have been aggregated into the following three reportable segments: Employer Services, PEO Services and Dealer Services. The primary components of the Other segment are miscellaneous processing services, such as customer financing transactions, non-recurring gains and losses and certain expenses that have not been charged to the reportable segments, such as stock-based compensation expense. Certain revenues and expenses are charged to the reportable segments at a standard rate for management reasons. Other costs are recorded based on management responsibility. The fiscal 2009 and 2008 reportable segments revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes have been adjusted to reflect updated fiscal 2010 budgeted foreign exchange rates. In addition, there is a reconciling item for the difference between actual interest income earned on invested funds held for clients and interest credited to Employer Services and PEO Services at a standard rate of 4.5%. The reportable segments results also include an internal cost of capital charge related to the funding of acquisitions and other investments. All of these adjustments/charges are reconciling items to our reportable segments revenues and/or earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and results in the elimination of these adjustments/charges in consolidation. Reportable segments assets include funds held for clients, but exclude corporate cash, corporate marketable securities and goodwill.

Controls and Procedures Attached as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K are certifications of ADPs Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which are required by Rule 13a-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). This Controls and Procedures section should be read in conjunction with the report of Deloitte & Touche LLP that appears on page 70 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
Managements Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company carried out an evaluation (the evaluation), under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2010 in ensuring that (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (ii) such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms.
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting It is the responsibility of Automatic Data Processing, Inc.s (ADP) management to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to ADPs management and board of directors regarding the preparation of reliable financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
ADPs internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of ADP; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of ADP are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of ADP; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of ADPs assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements of ADP.
69 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Management has performed an assessment of the effectiveness of ADPs internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2010 based upon criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management determined that ADPs internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2010.
Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of ADP included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the operating effectiveness of ADPs internal control over financial reporting. The Deloitte & Touche LLP attestation report is set forth below.

Reidy Chief Financial     Officer Roseland, New Jersey August 25 , 2010 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in ADPs internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, ADPs internal control over financial reporting.
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Automatic Data Processing, Inc.
Roseland, New Jersey We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
70 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended June 30, 2010 of the Company and our report dated August 25, 2010, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule.
