ADP is also a leading provider of integrated computing solutions to auto, truck, motorcycle, marine, recreational vehicle, and heavy equipment retailers and manufacturers throughout the world.

The Companys Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, all amendments to those reports, and the Proxy Statement for its Annual Meeting of Stockholders are made available, free of charge, on its website at www.adp.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports have been filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and are also available at the SECs internet site at www.sec.gov.
Segments of Business The Companys reportable segments are: Employer Services, Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services, and Dealer Services. For financial information by segment and by geographic area, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A brief description of each reportable segments operations is provided below.
Employer Services Employer Services offers a comprehensive range of HR information, payroll processing, time and labor management, and tax and benefits administration solutions and services, including traditional and Web-based outsourcing solutions, that assist employers in the United States, Canada, Europe, South America (primarily Brazil), Australia and Asia to recruit, staff, manage, pay and retain their employees. As of June 30, 2012, Employer Services assisted approximately 564,000 employers with approximately 652,000 payrolls. Employer Services markets these solutions and services through its direct marketing salesforce and, on a limited basis, through indirect sales channels, such as marketing relationships with banks and accountants, among others. In fiscal 2012, 78% of Employer Services revenues were from the United States, 14% were from Europe, 5% were from Canada, and 3% were from South America (primarily Brazil), Australia, and Asia.
United States Employer Services approach to the market is to match clients needs to the solutions and services that will best meet their expectations. To facilitate this approach, in the United States, Employer Services is comprised of the following market-facing groups: Small Business Services (SBS) (serving primarily organizations with fewer than 50 employees); Major Account Services (serving primarily organizations with between 50 and 999 employees); and National Account Services (serving primarily organizations with 1,000 or more employees).
3 ADP provides payroll services that include the preparation of client employee paychecks, electronic direct deposits, and stored value payroll cards, along with employee pay statements, supporting journals, summaries, and management reports. ADP also supplies the quarterly and annual social security, Medicare, and federal, state and local income tax withholding reports required to be filed by employers. ADP enables its largest clients to interface their major enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications with ADPs outsourced payroll services. For those companies that choose to process payroll in-house, ADP delivers stand-alone services such as payroll tax filing, check printing and distribution, year-end tax statements ( i.e.
, Form W-2), and wage garnishment services. Other stand-alone services delivered by ADP include Retirement Services, Talent Solutions, Benefit Services, and Time and Labor Management Services. In addition, our ADP Mobile Solutions application gives our clients employees access to their vital HR, payroll, time, and benefits information via multiple smartphone platforms.
In order to address the growing business process outsourcing (BPO) market for clients seeking human resource information systems and benefit outsourcing solutions, ADP offers its integrated comprehensive outsourcing services (COS) solution that allows larger clients to outsource to ADP their HR, payroll, payroll administration, employee service center, benefits administration, and time and labor management functions. In fiscal 2012, ADP broadened its BPO offerings with the addition of recruitment process outsourcing services for large clients. For mid-sized clients, ADP Workforce Now  Comprehensive Services provides integrated tools and technology to support payroll, a full-featured benefits administration solution, HR services and administration needs from recruitment to retirement. ADP also offers ADP Resource  , an integrated, flexible HR and payroll service offering for smaller clients that provides a menu of optional services, such as 401(k), FSA, and a comprehensive Pay-by-Pay  workers compensation payment program.
ADPs Added Value Services division includes the following businesses: Compliance and Payment Solutions (CAPS) (formerly known as Tax and Financial Services), Insurance Services, and Tax Credit Services. These businesses primarily support SBS, Major Account Services and/or National Account Services, and their services are sold through those businesses, as well as by dedicated sales teams and via marketing arrangements with alliance partners.
CAPS offers a host of full outsourcing services,   including payroll tax, garnishment processing, payment processing, unemployment compensation management, and sales and   use tax filing. CAPS also offers wage   verification services through a resale arrangement with a third party.   In addition, CAPS offers software-as-a-service   solutions including sales, use, and value-added tax calculation processing and automated accounts payable processing. As   part of CAPS payroll tax services, CAPS   collects and processes federal, state, and local payroll taxes on behalf of,   and from, ADP clients and remits these taxes to   the appropriate taxing authorities. This business provides an electronic interface between ADP clients and over 7,000   federal, state, and local tax agencies in the   United States, from the Internal Revenue Service to local governments. In   fiscal 2012, CAPS in the United States   processed and delivered approximately 48 million employee year-end tax statements and over 40 million employer payroll   tax returns and deposits, and moved $1.3   trillion in client funds to taxing authorities and its clients employees via   electronic transfer, direct deposit, and   ADPCheck TM . CAPS is also responsible for the efficient   movement of information and funds from clients   to third parties through service offerings such as new hire reporting, payroll check (ADPCheck), full service direct   deposit (FSDD), and stored value payroll card   (ALINE Card by ADP SM ).
Insurance Services provides a comprehensive   Pay-by-Pay workers compensation payment program and, through Automatic Data Processing Insurance Agency, Inc.,   offers workers compensation and group health insurance to small and mid-sized   clients through a variety of insurance carriers.
4 Tax Credit Services provides job tax credit   services that assist employers in the identification of, and filing for, federal, state, and local tax credits and   other incentives based on geography, demographics, and other criteria and includes negotiation of incentive   packages with applicable governmental   agencies.
Employer Services also provides the following solutions and services: Retirement Services provides recordkeeping and/or   related administrative services to primarily small and mid-sized clients with respect to various types of retirement   (primarily 401(k) and SIMPLE IRA) plans,   deferred compensation plans, and premium only cafeteria   plans.
Talent Solutions includes Screening and Selection   Services, Applicant Management Services, I-9 Services, and Talent Management solutions. Screening and Selection   Services provides background checks, reference   verifications and an HR help desk. Applicant Management Services provides employers with a Web-based solution to   manage their talent throughout the hiring   process. I-9 Services provides electronic processing, storing and tracking of   employment eligibility verification forms   ( i.e., Form I-9). Talent Management solutions, which ADP provides both through its own services and through resale   arrangements with third parties, include Compensation Management, Performance Management, Learning Management,   and Succession Planning.
Benefit Services provides benefits administration   across all market segments, including management of open enrollment and ongoing enrollment of benefits, and   leave of absence, COBRA, Dependent Care,   Commuter, Health Reimbursement Arrangements, Health Savings Accounts, and FSA administration.
Time and Labor Management Services provides   solutions for employers to capture, calculate, and report employee time and attendance.
ADP also provides cloud-based medical practice management services through AdvancedMD  . These services include practice management software, electronic health records solutions, and comprehensive outsourced medical billing services.
ADP made several acquisitions in fiscal 2012, including RightThing, LLC, a provider of recruitment process outsourcing and recruitment training, W. Ray Wallace & Associates, Inc., a provider of tax credit services, Asparity Decisions Solutions, Inc., a supplier of employee benefits decision support tools, SHPS Human Resource Solutions, Inc., a provider of benefits outsourcing solutions, including eligibility and enrollment, health spending accounts, COBRA administration, absence management, benefits advocacy and print and fulfillment, and PhyLogic Healthcare, a provider of comprehensive outsourced medical billing services.
International Employer Services has a growing presence outside of the United States, where it offers solutions on the basis of both geographic and specific client business needs. ADPs GlobalView  offering is available in 41 countries. GlobalView is built on the SAP  ERP Human Capital Management and the SAP NetWeaver  platform and offers multinational and global companies an end-to-end outsourcing solution enabling standardized payroll processing and human resource administration. As of the end of fiscal 2012, 121 clients had contracted for GlobalView services, with approximately 1.1 million employees being processed. Upon completing the implementation for all these clients, ADP expects to be providing GlobalView services to over 2 million employees.
5 ADP also offers in-country best of breed payroll and human resource outsourcing solutions to both small and large clients in over a dozen foreign countries. In each of Canada and Europe, ADP is the leading provider of payroll processing (including full departmental outsourcing) and human resource administration services. Within Europe, Employer Services has business operations supporting its in-country solutions in eight countries: France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. It also offers services in Ireland (from the United Kingdom) and in Portugal (from Spain). In South America (primarily Brazil), Australia, and Asia (primarily China), ADP provides traditional service bureau payroll services, and also offers full departmental outsourcing of payroll services. ADP also offers wage and tax collection and remittance services in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and France.
Through its ADP Streamline  offering, which is available in 73 countries (40 of which are countries in which ADP also offers its GlobalView services), ADP also offers a single point of contact for global payroll processing and human resource administration services for multinational companies with small and mid-sized operations. At the end of fiscal 2012, ADP Streamline was used by 495 multinational companies with approximately 211,000 employees being processed.
In fiscal 2012, ADP continued to expand its best of breed offering through the acquisition of Ma Foi Consulting Solutions Limited, a provider of managed payroll services and social benefits administration services in India.
Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services In the United States, ADP TotalSource  , the Companys PEO business, provides approximately 6,500 clients with comprehensive employment administration outsourcing solutions through a co-employment relationship pursuant to which the employees who work at a clients location (worksite employees) are co-employed by us and the client. These comprehensive solutions include payroll, payroll tax filing, HR guidance, 401(k) plan administration, benefits administration, compliance services, health and workers compensation coverage, and other supplemental benefits for employees. ADP TotalSource is the largest PEO in the United States based on the number of worksite employees. ADP TotalSource has 49 offices located in 23 states and serves approximately 268,000 worksite employees in all 50 states.
Dealer Services Dealer Services provides integrated dealer management systems (such a system is also known in the industry as a DMS), digital marketing solutions (including website, sales leads, email, search, display, and social media marketing services), and other business management solutions to auto, truck, motorcycle, marine, recreational vehicle (RV), and heavy equipment retailers and manufacturers in North America, Europe, South Africa, the Middle East, and the Asia Pacific region. Over 26,000 auto, truck, motorcycle, marine, RV, and heavy equipment retailers and manufacturers in nearly 100 countries use ADPs DMS products, digital marketing solutions, other software applications, networking solutions, data integration, and/or consulting services.
Clients use ADPs DMS solutions to manage core business activities such as accounting, inventory management, factory communications, appointment scheduling, vehicle financing and insurance, sales, and service. In addition to its DMS solutions, Dealer Services offers its clients a full suite of additional integrated applications to address each department and functional area of the dealership, including customer relationship management (CRM) applications, front-end sales and marketing/advertising solutions, and an IP Telephony phone system fully-integrated into the DMS to help dealerships drive sales processes and business development initiatives. Dealer Services also provides its dealership clients computer hardware, hardware maintenance services, software support, system design, and network consulting services.
6 Dealer Services also designs, establishes, and maintains communications networks for its dealership clients that allow interactive communications among multiple site locations as well as links between franchised dealers and their vehicle manufacturer franchisors. These networks are used for activities such as new vehicle ordering and status inquiry, warranty submission and validation, parts and vehicle location, dealership customer credit application submission and decision-making, vehicle repair estimation, and acquisition of vehicle registration and lien holder information.
Dealer Services also provides digital marketing solutions via The Cobalt Group (Cobalt), which ADP acquired in 2010. Cobalts digital marketing solutions and services include websites, sales leads, email, search, display, and social media marketing and management services. These solutions are sold both as retail network marketing platforms in conjunction with the manufacturers of ten leading automotive brands, as well as directly to auto dealerships and regional dealer associations. Cobalt  provides marketing solutions and services to nearly half of the auto dealerships in the United States, as well as to auto dealers in Canada and Mexico.
Dealer Services offers comprehensive training and business process consulting services for many of its business solutions. ADPs DMS and other software solutions are available as on-site applications installed at the dealership or as application service provider (ASP) managed services solutions (in which clients outsource their information technology management activities to Dealer Services).
Markets and Marketing Methods Employer Services offers services in the United States, Canada, Europe, South America (primarily Brazil), Australia, and Asia. PEO Services offers services exclusively in the United States. Dealer Services has offerings in North America, Europe, South Africa, the Middle East and the Asia Pacific region. In select emerging markets, Dealer Services uses distributors to sell, implement and support ADPs solutions.
None of ADPs major business groups has a single homogenous client base or market. Employer Services and PEO Services have clients from a large variety of industries and markets. Within this client base are concentrations of clients in specific industries. Dealer Services primarily serves automobile dealers, which in turn may be dependent on a relatively small number of auto manufacturers, but also serves truck, powersports ( i.e.
, motorcycle, marine and recreational) and heavy equipment dealers, auto repair shops, used car lots, state departments of motor vehicles, and manufacturers of automobiles and trucks. Employer Services also offers services to auto dealers. While concentrations of clients exist, no one client or industry group is material to ADPs overall revenues.
Historically, ADPs businesses have not been overly sensitive to price changes, although in the current economic conditions we have observed, among some clients and groups of clients, an impact on sensitivity to pricing and demand for ADPs services. ADP enjoys a leadership position in each of its major service offerings and does not believe any major service or major business unit of ADP is subject to unique market risk.
Competition The industries in which ADP operates are highly competitive. ADP knows of no reliable statistics by which it can determine the number of its competitors, but it believes that it is one of the largest providers of business outsourcing solutions in the world. Employer Services and PEO Services compete with other independent business outsourcing companies, companies providing enterprise resource planning services, software companies and financial institutions. Captive in-house functions, whereby a company installs and operates its own business processing systems, are another competitive factor in the industries in which Employer Services and PEO Services operate. Dealer Services competitors include full service DMS providers such as The Reynolds & Reynolds Company (Dealer Services largest DMS competitor in the United States and Canada), DealerTrack, Inc., and companies providing applications and services that compete with Dealer Services non-DMS applications and services, such as Auto Trader Group, Inc. and Dealer.com, Inc.
7 Competition in ADPs industries is primarily based on service responsiveness, product quality, and price. ADP believes that it is very competitive in each of these areas and that there are no material negative factors impacting ADPs competitive position.
Clients and Client Contracts ADP provides its services to approximately 600,000 clients. In fiscal 2012, no single client or group of affiliated clients accounted for revenues in excess of 2% of annual consolidated revenues.
Our business is typically characterized by long-term client relationships that result in recurring revenue. ADP is continuously in the process of performing implementation services for new clients. Depending on the service agreement and/or the size of the client, the installation or conversion period for new clients could vary from a short period of time for an SBS client (as little as 24 hours) to a longer period for a National Account Services or Dealer Services client with multiple deliverables (generally six to twelve months), and in some cases may exceed two years for a large GlobalView client or other large, complicated implementation. Although we monitor sales that have not yet been billed or installed, we do not view this metric as material in light of the recurring nature of our business. This is not a reported number, but it is used by management as a planning tool relating to resources needed to install services, and a means of assessing our performance against the installation timing expectations of our clients.
ADPs average client retention is estimated at approximately 11 years in Employer Services, approximately 6 years in PEO Services, and 10 or more years in Dealer Services, and has not varied significantly from period to period.
ADPs services are provided under written price quotations or service agreements having varying terms and conditions. No one price quotation or service agreement is material to ADP.
Systems Development and Programming During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012, 2011, and 2010, ADP invested $706 million, $674 million, and $614 million, respectively, from continuing operations, in systems development and programming, migration to new computing technologies and the development of new products and maintenance of our existing technologies, including purchases of new software and software licenses.
Product Development ADP continually upgrades, enhances, and expands its existing solutions and services. Generally, no new solution or service has a significant effect on ADPs revenues or negatively impacts its existing solutions and services, and ADPs solutions and services have significant remaining life cycles.
Licenses ADP is the licensee under a number of agreements for computer programs and databases. ADPs business is not dependent upon a single license or group of licenses. Third-party licenses, patents, trademarks, and franchises are not material to ADPs business as a whole.
8 Number of Employees ADP employed approximately 57,000 persons as of June 30, 2012.
Item 1A. Risk Factors Our businesses routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate. Risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business. The following information should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion includes a number of forward-looking statements. You should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in the first paragraph under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, reference in this section to we, our, us or similar terms means ADP, together with its subsidiaries. The level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time, and any of these risks may have a material effect on our business.
Changes in laws and regulations may decrease our revenues and earnings Portions of ADPs business are subject to governmental regulations. Changes in laws or governmental regulations may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business. For example, a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities or client employees. Changes in taxation requirements in the United States or in other countries could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income. Changes in laws that govern the co-employment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our PEO business.
Cybersecurity and privacy breaches may hurt our business, damage our reputation, increase our costs, and cause losses Our systems and networks store personal information about our clients and employees of our clients. In addition, our retirement services systems maintain investor account information for retirement plans. We have security systems and information technology infrastructure in place designed to protect against unauthorized access to such information. However, there is still a risk that the security systems and infrastructure that we maintain may not be successful in protecting against all security breaches and cyber attacks. Third parties, including vendors that provide services for our operations, could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure. Any significant violations of data privacy could result in the loss of business, litigation, regulatory investigations, and penalties that could damage our reputation and adversely affect the growth of our business.
Our systems may be subject to disruptions that could adversely affect our business and reputation Many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of complicated transactions. We rely heavily on our payroll, financial, accounting, and other data processing systems. If any of these systems fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention, or damage to our reputation. We have disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events including natural disasters, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures, or similar events. Despite our preparations, our plans may not be successful in preventing the loss of client data, service interruptions, disruptions to our operations, or damage to our important facilities.
9 If we fail to adapt our technology to meet client needs and preferences, the demand for our services may diminish Our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences. In order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands, we continually upgrade, enhance, and expand our existing solutions and services. If we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges, the demand for our services may diminish.
Political and economic factors may adversely affect our business and financial results Trade, monetary and fiscal policies, and political and economic conditions may substantially change, and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility. When there is a slowdown in the economy, employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses. Clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services or renegotiating their contracts with us. In addition, a reduction in availability of financing during such conditions, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our access to short-term debt markets to meet liquidity needs required by our Employer Services business.
We invest our client funds in liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, money market securities, and other cash equivalents. Nevertheless, our client fund assets are subject to general market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks. These risks may be exacerbated, individually or in unison, during periods of unusual financial market volatility.
We are dependent upon various large banks to execute Automated Clearing House and wire transfers as part of our client payroll and tax services. While we have contingency plans in place for bank failures, a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll and tax services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity.
We derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income outside of the United States and, as a result, we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability The major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have consistently given us their highest long-term debt and commercial paper ratings. Failure to maintain high credit ratings on long-term and short-term debt could increase our cost of borrowing, reduce our ability to obtain intra-day borrowing required by our Employer Services business, and ultimately reduce our client interest revenue.
We may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel Our ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our clients. Competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and, if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel, results of our operations may suffer.

Item 2. Properties ADP owns 13 of its processing/print centers, and 24 other operational offices, sales offices, and its corporate headquarters in Roseland, New Jersey, which aggregate approximately 3,739,235 square feet. None of ADPs owned facilities is subject to any material encumbrances. ADP leases space for some of its processing centers, other operational offices, and sales offices. All of these leases, which aggregate approximately 6,677,356 square feet in North America, Europe, South America (primarily Brazil), Asia, Australia and Africa, expire at various times up to the year 2036. ADP believes its facilities are currently adequate for their intended purposes and are adequately maintained.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings In the normal course of business, ADP is subject to various claims and litigation. While the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable, ADP believes that it has valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against it and that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
11 Part II Item 5. Market for the Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market for the Registrants Common Equity The principal market for the Companys common stock (symbol: ADP) is the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following table reconciles results within our Selected Financial Data for the years ended June 30, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, and 2008 to adjusted results that exclude a gain on the sale of assets related to rights and obligations to resell a third-party expense management platform and certain favorable tax items. We use certain adjusted results, among other measures, to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by us and improves our ability to understand our operating performance. Since adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), they should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, net earnings from continuing operations and diluted EPS from continuing operations, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Return on equity from continuing operations has been calculated as net earnings from continuing operations divided by average total stockholders equity. Our fiscal 2012 ROE includes the impact from the sale of assets related to rights and obligations to resell a third-party expense management platform which increased return on equity by 0.6%.

The Companys reportable segments are: Employer Services, Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services, and Dealer Services. A brief description of each segments operations is provided below.
Employer Services Employer Services offers a comprehensive range of HR information, payroll processing, time and labor management, and tax and benefits administration solutions and services, including traditional and Web-based outsourcing solutions, that assist employers in the United States, Canada, Europe, South America (primarily Brazil), Australia, and Asia to recruit, staff, manage, pay and retain their employees.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW For more than 60 years, ADP has served as a trusted human resources, payroll, benefits, and integrated computing solutions partner to employers and automotive dealerships around the world. Our mission is to power organizations with insightful solutions that drive business success by delivering the best solutions to all of our markets ahead of the competition on a consistent basis. ADPs strengths have traditionally been in three core areas: a broad suite of products that deliver relief from administrative burdens; a strong service orientation; and strong sales and distribution.
We have redefined our strategic pillars to align them with our goals which are predicated on driving innovation, service excellence and building talent. Our strategic pillars are to: Grow our integrated suite of cloud based Human Capital Management (HCM),   benefits, and payroll solutions to serve the US market; Invest to grow and scale our market leading HR Business Process   Outsourcing solutions by leveraging our platforms and processes; Leverage our global presence to offer clients HCM, benefits, and payroll   solutions where they do business; and Grow and deepen our solutions offering to ensure our key adjacencies are   market leaders.
We believe the strategic pillars outlined above will help us build on our core competencies and develop new ones as we continue to focus on delivering stellar service to our clients, creating an environment that fosters innovation, positioning ADP as the global HCM market leader, and enhancing long-term total shareholder return.
During the year ended June 30, 2012 (fiscal 2012), we achieved solid results that reflect the strength and resilience of our underlying business model despite the challenges posed by the current economic environment. Our focus on product innovation and our investment in sales associate headcount has led to growth in new business sales and solid revenue retention across our business segments. We are pleased with the current performance of our strategic acquisitions together with the continued strength in our same-store-sales growth. However, we continue to be impacted by the decline in high-margin client interest revenues as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by an increase in our average client funds balance. We expect the lower interest rates to continue to impact us during the year ending June 30, 2013 (fiscal 2013).
18 Consolidated revenues in fiscal 2012 increased 8%, to $10,665.2 million, as compared to $9,879.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2011 (fiscal 2011). Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 10%, to $2,122.1 million, as compared to $1,932.7 million in fiscal 2011 and net earnings from continuing operations increased 11%, to $1,388.5 million, as compared to $1,254.2 million in fiscal 2011. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 12%, to $2.82 in fiscal 2012, from $2.52 per share in fiscal 2011, on fewer shares outstanding. Our results for the year included a gain on the sale of assets related to rights and obligations to resell a third-party expense management platform of $66.0 million, or $41.2 million after tax, which contributed to increasing our diluted EPS from continuing operations 3%, or $0.08 per share.
Each of our business segments has continued to demonstrate core strength. Employer Services revenues increased 7% to $7,567.7 million, PEO Services revenues increased 15% to $1,771.4 million, and Dealer Services revenues increased 10% to $1,683.7 million in fiscal 2012. Our Employer Services pays per control metric, which represents the number of employees on our clients' payrolls as measured on a same-store-sales basis utilizing a representative subset of payrolls ranging from small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions, increased 3.0% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2012. Our worldwide client revenue retention rate remained strong throughout the year ending at 91%.
Employer Services and PEO Services new business sales, which represent annualized recurring revenues anticipated from sales orders to new and existing clients, grew 13% worldwide, to over $1.2 billion in fiscal 2012. Dealer Services new business sales showed strength as we continued to experience the effects of a stronger automotive industry and increased penetration of applications within our base.
Consolidated interest on funds held for clients decreased approximately 9%, or $46.8 million, to $493.3 million from $540.1 million in fiscal 2011. The decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 2.8% in fiscal 2012 as compared to 3.2% in fiscal 2011, partially offset by growth in average client funds balances of 6% due to our positive Employer Services metrics.
The safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification of our clients funds are the foremost objectives of our investment strategy. We continue to promote this strategy by investing in a prudent and conservative manner in accordance with our investment guidelines with a predominant focus on AAA/AA securities. We do not hold direct investments in sovereign debt issued by Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, or Spain. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). This investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations.
19 Our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at June 30, 2012, with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1,665.4 million. Our net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,910.2 million in fiscal 2012, as compared to $1,705.8 million in fiscal 2011. This increase in cash flows from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 was due to higher net earnings, lower pension plan contributions, and a favorable change in the net components of working capital, partially offset by a variance in the timing of tax-related net cash payments. The increase in cash provided by investing activities of $10,584.2 million is due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations, the amount of cash used for business combinations and cash receipts related to the sale of property, plant and equipment and other assets. The increase in cash used in financing activities of $10,293.1 million is primarily due to the timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds, as compared to the prior year.
We have a strong business model with a high percentage of recurring revenues, excellent margins, the ability to generate consistent, healthy cash flows, strong client retention, and low capital expenditure requirements. We continue to enhance value to our shareholders, and in fiscal 2012 returned excess cash of $739.7 million through dividends and $741.3 million through our share buyback program, while also investing $265.7 million in new acquisitions. In the last five fiscal years, we have reduced the Companys common stock outstanding by approximately 10% through share buybacks, net of the effect of common stock issued under employee stock-based compensation programs. We have also raised the dividend payout per share for 37 consecutive years.
20 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Years ended June 30, 2012 2011 $ Change %       Change Total revenues $ 10,665.2 $ 9,879.5 $ 785.7 8 % Costs of revenues: Operating expenses 5,380.1 4,900.9 479.2 10 % Systems development       and programming costs 599.9 577.2 22.7 4 % Depreciation and amortization 260.0 253.4 6.6 3 % Total costs of revenues 6,240.0 5,731.5 508.5 9 % Selling, general and administrative       expenses 2,466.2 2,323.3 142.9 6 % Interest expense 7.7 8.6 (0.9 ) (10 %) Total expenses 8,713.9 8,063.4 650.5 8 % Other income, net (170.8 ) (116.6 ) 54.2 46 % Earnings from continuing operations before       income taxes $ 2,122.1 $ 1,932.7 $ 189.4 10 % Margin 19.9 % 19.6 % Provision for income taxes $ 733.6 $ 678.5 $ 55.1 8 % Effective tax rate 34.6 % 35.1 % Net earnings from continuing       operations $ 1,388.5 $ 1,254.2 $ 134.3 11 % Diluted earnings per share from continuing       operations $ 2.82 $ 2.52 $ 0.30 12 % Total Revenues Our total revenues increased $785.7 million, or 8%, to $10,665.2 million in fiscal 2012, from $9,879.5 million in fiscal 2011, due to an increase in revenues in Employer Services of 7%, or $524.8 million, to $7,567.7 million, PEO Services of 15%, or $227.5 million, to $1,771.4 million, and Dealer Services of 10%, or $147.7 million, to $1,683.7 million. Total revenues would have increased approximately 6% without the impact of recently completed acquisitions and the impact to revenues pertaining to the sale of assets related to rights and obligations to resell a third-party expense management platform. There was no impact to total revenue growth rates as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Total revenues for fiscal 2012 include interest on funds held for clients of $493.3 million, as compared to $540.1 million in fiscal 2011. The decrease in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 2.8% during fiscal 2012 as compared to 3.2% for fiscal 2011, partially offset by an increase in our average client funds balance of 6%, to $17.9 billion in fiscal 2012.
Total Expenses Our total expenses increased $650.5 million, or 8%, to $8,713.9 million in fiscal 2012, from $8,063.4 million in fiscal 2011. The increase in our consolidated expenses was due to an increase in operating expenses of $479.2 million, an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $142.9 million and an increase in systems development and programming costs of $22.7 million. Total expenses would have increased approximately 6% without the impact of recently completed acquisitions.
21 Our total costs of revenues increased 9%, to $6,240.0 million in fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011 due to an increase in operating expenses of $479.2 million and an increase in systems development and programming costs of $22.7 million.
Operating expenses increased $479.2 million, or 10%, in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 due to the increase in revenues described above, including the increases in PEO Services, which has pass-through costs that are re-billable and which includes costs for benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees. These pass-through costs were $1,363.6 million in fiscal 2012, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,060.3 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $303.3 million. These pass-through costs were $1,182.2 million in fiscal 2011, which included costs for benefits coverage of $937.8 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $244.4 million. The increase in operating expenses is also due to operating expenses related to businesses acquired of $132.1 million, and higher labor-related expenses in Employer Services of $38.5 million. Additionally, operating expenses decreased $5.4 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Systems development and programming costs increased $22.7 million, or 4%, in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, due to businesses acquired of $16.1 million, partially offset by a higher proportion of capitalizable efforts directed at feature and functionality product enhancements in the period. Additionally, systems, development and programming costs decreased $1.3 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $142.9 million, or 6%, in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The increase in expenses was related to severance expenses of $51.2 million resulting from cost reduction initiatives focused on the realization of synergies in certain international businesses as we adjust our cost structure in light of the softer European economic environment, an increase in selling expenses of $55.5 million resulting from increases in sales force headcount coupled with an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of acquired businesses of $36.7 million. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $9.0 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Other Income, net Years ended June 30, 2012 2011 $ Change (Dollars in millions) Interest income on       corporate funds $ (85.2 ) $ (88.8 ) $ (3.6 ) Realized gains on available-for-sale       securities (32.1 ) (38.0 ) (5.9 ) Realized losses on       available-for-sale securities 7.7 3.6 (4.1 ) Realized gains on investment in Reserve       Fund - (0.9 ) (0.9 ) Impairment losses on       available-for-sale securities 5.8 - (5.8 ) Impairment losses on assets held for       sale 2.2 11.7 9.5 Gain on sale of       assets (66.0 ) - 66.0 Net gains on sales of buildings - (1.8 ) (1.8 ) Other, net (3.2 ) (2.4 ) 0.8 Other income, net $ (170.8 ) $ (116.6 ) $ 54.2 Other income, net, increased $54.2 million in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. This increase was due to a gain of $66.0 million pertaining to the sale of assets related to rights and obligations to resell a third-party expense management platform during fiscal 2012. This increase was partially offset by the net activity related to our available-for-sale securities, including realized gains, realized losses and impairment losses, which together resulted in a decrease in other income, net of $15.8 million, and a decrease in interest income on corporate funds of $3.6 million during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The decrease in interest income on corporate funds resulted from lower average interest rates from 2.6% for fiscal 2011 to 2.1% for fiscal 2012, partially offset by increasing average daily corporate funds, which increased from $3.5 billion for fiscal 2011 to $4.0 billion for fiscal 2012. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed the sale of two buildings previously classified as assets held for sale for their combined carrying value of $6.9 million, net of selling costs. We had previously recorded impairment charges related to these two buildings of $2.2 million and $11.7 million during fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively.
22 Earnings from continuing operations before Income Taxes Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $189.4 million, or 10%, from $1,932.7 million in fiscal 2011 to $2,122.1 million in fiscal 2012 due to the increase in revenues and the gain on sale of assets, partially offset by the increase in expenses discussed above. Overall margin increased approximately 30 basis points in fiscal 2012 with approximately 60 basis points of the margin contribution related to the gain on the sale of assets and approximately 40 basis points of margin decline attributable to acquisitions.
Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rates in fiscal 2012 and 2011 were 34.6% and 35.1%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year is the result of the final resolution of certain tax matters, the expiration of certain statutes of limitation, and the availability of foreign tax credits, partially offset by an unfavorable mix of earnings between jurisdictions.
Net Earnings from continuing operations and Diluted Earnings per Share from continuing operations Net earnings from continuing operations increased $134.3 million, or 11%, from $1,254.2 million in fiscal 2011 to $1,388.5 million in fiscal 2012 and includes an after-tax gain on sale of assets of $41.2 million. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 12%, to $2.82 compared from $2.52 in fiscal 2011. The increase in diluted earnings per share reflects the increase in net earnings and the impact of fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of approximately 14.6 million shares during fiscal 2012 and the repurchase of 14.2 million shares in fiscal 2011.
The following table reconciles our results for fiscal 2012 to adjusted results that exclude the sale of assets related to rights and obligations to resell a third-party expense management platform. We use certain adjusted results, among other measures, to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by us and improves our ability to understand our operating performance. Since adjusted earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, earnings from continuing operations, and diluted EPS from continuing operations and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.
Although we have presented our results for fiscal 2012 adjusted to exclude the gain on the sale of assets discussed above, we do not expect this sale of assets to have a material impact on the results of our future operations.

The increase in diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for fiscal 2012 reflects the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the repurchase of approximately 14.6 million shares during fiscal 2012 and the repurchase of 14.2 million shares in fiscal 2011.
24 Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Years ended June       30, 2011 2010 $ Change %   Change Total revenues $ 9,879.5 $ 8,927.7 $ 951.8 11 % Costs of revenues: Operating expenses 4,900.9 4,277.2 623.7 15 % Systems development and       programming costs 577.2 513.9 63.3 12 % Depreciation and       amortization 253.4 238.6 14.8 6 % Total costs of revenues 5,731.5 5,029.7 701.8 14 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,323.3 2,127.4 195.9 9 % Interest expense 8.6 8.6 - - Total expenses 8,063.4 7,165.7 897.7 13 % Other income, net (116.6 ) (101.2 ) 15.4 15 % Earnings from continuing operations before       income taxes $ 1,932.7 $ 1,863.2 $ 69.5 4 % Margin 19.6 % 20.9 % Provision for income taxes $ 678.5 $ 655.9 $ 22.6 3 % Effective tax rate 35.1 % 35.2 % Net earnings from continuing       operations $ 1,254.2 $ 1,207.3 $ 46.9 4 % Diluted earnings per share from continuing       operations $ 2.52 $ 2.40 $ 0.12 5 % Total Revenues Our total revenues increased 11% to $9,879.5 million in fiscal 2011, from $8,927.7 million in fiscal 2010, due to an increase in revenues in Employer Services of 8%, or $507.8 million, to $7,042.9 million, PEO Services of 17%, or $227.1 million, to $1,543.9 million, and Dealer Services of 23%, or $287.9 million, to $1,536.0 million. Total revenue would have increased approximately 6% without the impact of acquisitions. There was no impact to total revenue growth rates as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Total revenues for fiscal 2011 include interest on funds held for clients of $540.1 million, as compared to $542.8 million in fiscal 2010. The decrease in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 3.2% during fiscal 2011 as compared to 3.6% for fiscal 2010, partially offset by an increase in our average client funds balance of 11%, to $16.9 billion in fiscal 2011.
Total Expenses Our total expenses in fiscal 2011 increased $897.7 million, to $8,063.4 million, from $7,165.7 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in our consolidated expenses was due to an increase in operating expenses of $623.7 million, an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $195.9 million and an increase in systems development and programming costs of $63.3 million.
Our total costs of revenues increased 14%, to $5,731.5 million in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010 due to an increase in operating expenses of $623.7 million and an increase in systems development and programming costs of $63.3 million.
25 Operating expenses increased $623.7 million, or 15%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to the increase in revenues described above, including the increases in PEO Services, which has pass-through costs that are re-billable and which includes costs for benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees. These pass-through costs were $1,182.2 million in fiscal 2011, which included costs for benefits coverage of $937.8 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $244.4 million. These pass-through costs were $988.5 million in fiscal 2010, which included costs for benefits coverage of $811.5 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $176.9 million. The increase in operating expenses is also due to operating expenses related to businesses acquired of $230.6 million, and higher expenses in Employer Services of $47.4 million related to increased service costs for investment in client-facing associates. Additionally, operating expenses increased due to the settlement of a PEO Services state unemployment matter that reduced operating expenses $9.2 million in fiscal 2010. Lastly, operating expenses increased $5.6 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Systems development and programming costs increased $63.3 million, or 12%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, due to expenses of acquired businesses of $42.2 million and higher development expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $195.9 million, or 9%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase in expenses was due to higher selling expenses of $75.6 million resulting from increases in headcount over prior year levels coupled with an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of acquired businesses of $96.1 million, an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $5.9 million, and an increase in technology related security expenses of $8.1 million. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $5.6 million due to changes in foreign currency rates.

This increase was mainly due to an increase in realized gains on available-for-sale securities of $23.0 million, and a decrease in realized losses on available-for-sale securities of $9.8 million, which together increased other income, net, $32.8 million. Such amounts were offset in fiscal 2011 by an $11.7 million impairment loss on assets held for sale and a $10.0 million decrease in interest income on corporate funds resulting from flat average interest rates at 2.6%, as compared to the prior year, coupled with declining average daily corporate funds, which decreased from $3.8 billion in fiscal 2010 to $3.5 billion in fiscal 2011.
Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $69.5 million, or 4%, from $1,863.2 million in fiscal 2010 to $1,932.7 million in fiscal 2011 due to the increase in revenues partially offset by the increase in expenses discussed above. Overall margin decreased approximately 130 basis points in fiscal 2011 with approximately 90 basis points of the margin decline attributable to acquisitions.
26 Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rates in fiscal 2011 and 2010 were 35.1% and 35.2%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 is due to the resolution of certain tax matters in fiscal 2010 that resulted in a decrease to the effective tax rate of 0.7 percentage points for that period, offset by a decrease in federal and state income tax expense and a favorable mix of earnings in foreign jurisdictions in fiscal 2011.
Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Net earnings from continuing operations increased $46.9 million to $1,254.2 million in fiscal 2011, from $1,207.3 million in fiscal 2010, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 5%, to $2.52. The increase in net earnings in fiscal 2011 reflects the increase in earnings before income taxes and the impact of the tax matters discussed above. The increase in diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2011 reflects the increase in earnings and the impact of the tax matters discussed above coupled with the effects of fewer shares outstanding.
The following table reconciles our results for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 to adjusted results that exclude the impact of certain favorable tax items. We use certain adjusted results, among other measures, to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by us and improves our ability to understand our operating performance. Since adjusted earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, earnings from continuing operations and diluted EPS from continuing operations, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

This adjustment is made for management purposes so that the reportable segments revenues are presented on a consistent basis without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This adjustment is a reconciling item to revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and is eliminated in consolidation.
Certain revenues and expenses are charged to the reportable segments at a standard rate for management reasons. Other costs are charged to the reportable segments based on managements responsibility for the applicable costs. The primary components of the Other segment are the results of operations of ADP Indemnity (a wholly-owned captive insurance company that provides workers compensation and employers liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services worksite employees), non-recurring gains and losses, miscellaneous processing services, such as customer financing transactions, and certain expenses that have not been charged to the reportable segments, such as stock-based compensation expense.
In addition, the reconciling items include an adjustment for the difference between actual interest income earned on invested funds held for clients and interest credited to Employer Services and PEO Services at a standard rate of 4.5%. This allocation is made for management reasons so that the reportable segments results are presented on a consistent basis without the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. This allocation is a reconciling item to our reportable segments revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and is eliminated in consolidation.
29 Finally, the reportable segments results also include a cost of capital charge related to the funding of acquisitions and other investments. This charge is a reconciling item to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and is eliminated in consolidation.
Employer Services Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Revenues Employer Services' revenues increased $524.8 million, or 7%, to $7,567.7 million in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Revenues for our Employer Services business would have increased approximately 6% without the impact of acquisitions and revenues pertaining to the sale of assets related to rights and obligations to resell a third-party expense management platform. Revenues increased due to new business started during the year from new business sales growth, an increase in the number of employees on our clients payrolls, and the impact of price increases. Our worldwide client revenue retention rate for fiscal 2012 decreased slightly as compared to our rate for fiscal 2011. Pays per control, which represents the number of employees on our clients payrolls as measured on a same-store-sales basis utilizing a representative subset of payrolls ranging from small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions, increased 3.0% for fiscal 2012.
Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Employer Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $115.8 million, or 6%, to $1,972.3 million in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The increase was due to the increase in revenues of $524.8 million discussed above, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses of $409.0 million. In addition to an increase in expenses related to increased revenues, expenses increased for fiscal 2012 due to increases in sales headcount and labor-related costs over the same period prior year levels coupled with the effects of acquisitions. Overall margin decreased approximately 30 basis points from 26.4% to 26.1% for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, with approximately 80 basis points of margin decline attributable to acquisitions.
Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Revenues Employer Services' revenues increased $507.8 million, or 8%, to $7,042.9 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Revenues for our Employer Services business would have increased approximately 6% without the impact of acquisitions. Revenues increased due to new business started during the year from new business sales growth, an increase in the number of employees on our clients payrolls, and higher average client funds balances. Our worldwide client revenue retention rate increased 120 basis points in fiscal 2011 to 91.1% as compared to our rate for fiscal 2010 and our pays per control increased 2.4% in fiscal 2011 as compared to our rate for fiscal 2010.
Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Employer Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $115.1 million to $1,856.5 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was due to the increase in revenues of $507.8 million discussed above, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses of $392.7 million. In addition to an increase in expenses related to increased revenues, expenses increased in fiscal 2011 due to increases in sales and service headcount over fiscal 2010 levels coupled with the effects of acquisitions. Overall margin decreased approximately 20 basis points from 26.6% to 26.4% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, with approximately 110 basis points of margin decline attributable to acquisitions.
30 PEO Services Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Revenues PEO Services' revenues increased $227.5 million, or 15%, to $1,771.4 million in fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011. Such revenues include pass-through costs of $1,363.6 million for fiscal 2012 and $1,182.2 million for fiscal 2011 associated with benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage, and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees. The increase in revenues was due to a 12% increase in the average number of worksite employees, resulting from an increase in the number of new clients and growth in our existing clients.
Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes PEO Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $32.9 million, or 24%, to $170.2 million for fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011 due to growth in earnings related to the increase in the average number of worksite employees.

Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes PEO Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $10.1 million, or 8%, to $137.3 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to growth in earnings related to the increase in the number of average worksite employees. The increase was partially offset by the settlement of a state unemployment tax matter, which increased earnings before income taxes $9.2 million in fiscal 2010. Overall margin decreased to 8.9% in fiscal 2011 from 9.7% in fiscal 2010 due to a 70 basis point decline pertaining to the settlement of a fiscal 2010 state unemployment tax matter.
Dealer Services Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Revenues Dealer Services' revenues increased $147.7 million, or 10%, to $1,683.7 million for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Revenues for our Dealer Services business would have increased approximately 6% for fiscal 2012 without the impact of acquisitions. Revenues without acquisitions increased $90.9 million due to new clients, improved client retention, and growth in our key products during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011. The growth in our key products included increased users of our dealership front office solutions (including our customer relationship management ("CRM") applications and services), growth in our "Drive" dealer management system ("DMS") solution and hosted IP telephony services, and an increase in credit report and vehicle registration transaction revenues and increased activity in our digital marketing solutions and data services businesses.
31 Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Dealer Services' earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $43.8 million, or 19%, to $277.1 million fiscal 2012, as compared to the fiscal 2011. The increase was due to the increase in revenues of $147.7 million discussed above and was partially offset by higher operating expenses related to implementing and servicing new clients and products. Overall margin increased approximately 130 basis points from 15.2% to 16.5% for fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011 which includes approximately 20 basis points of margin decrease related to acquisitions. In addition, overall margin increased approximately 50 basis points due to acquisition-related costs incurred during fiscal 2011 related to our acquisition of Cobalt in the prior year.
Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Revenues Dealer Services' revenues increased $287.9 million, or 23%, to $1,536.0 million in fiscal 2011. Revenues for our Dealer Services business would have increased approximately 3% for fiscal 2011 without the impact of acquisitions, which increased revenues $250.7 million. Revenues increased $37.8 million due to new clients, improved client retention, and growth in our key products. The growth in our key products was driven by increased users of application service provider (ASP) managed services, CRM solutions and growth in hosted IP telephony as well as an increase in transaction revenues due to higher credit report checks and vehicle registrations.
Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Dealer Services' earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $29.2 million, or 14%, to $233.3 million in fiscal 2011. The increase was due to the increase in revenues of $287.9 million discussed above and was partially offset by higher operating expenses related to implementing and servicing new clients and products. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes also increased due to an asset impairment charge of $6.8 million recorded in fiscal 2010 resulting from the announcement by GM that it would shut down its Saturn division. Overall margin decreased from 16.4% to 15.2% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, which includes approximately 240 basis points of margin decline related to acquisitions, partially offset by the prior year effects of the Saturn impairment charge.
Other The primary components of the Other segment are the results of operations of ADP Indemnity, non-recurring gains and losses, miscellaneous processing services, such as customer financing transactions, and certain expenses that have not been charged to the reportable segments, such as stock-based compensation expense.
Stock-based compensation expense was $78.7 million, $76.3 million, and $67.6 million in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
ADP Indemnity provides workers compensation and employers liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services worksite employees up to a $1 million per occurrence retention. PEO Services has secured specific per occurrence and aggregate stop loss insurance from a wholly-owned and regulated insurance carrier of AIG that covers all losses in excess of the $1 million per occurrence retention and also any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level in each policy year. We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the PEO Services business. Premiums are charged to PEO Services to cover the claims expected to be incurred by the PEO Services worksite employees. Changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are recognized by ADP Indemnity.
Our net (gains) and losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities, including impairment losses, were $(18.6) million, $(34.4) million and $12.8 million in each of fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
32 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At June 30, 2012, cash and marketable securities were $1,665.4 million, stockholders equity was $6,114.0 million, and the ratio of long-term debt-to-equity was 0.3%. Working capital before funds held for clients and client funds obligations was $1,233.3 million, as compared to $1,252.2 million at June 30, 2011. The change in working capital compared to the prior fiscal year 2011 resulted from an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, an increase in accrued payroll and payroll related expenses, and an increase in income taxes payable, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents.
Our principal sources of liquidity for operations are derived from cash generated through operations and through corporate cash and marketable securities on hand. We continued to generate positive cash flows from operations during fiscal 2012, and we held approximately $1.7 billion of cash and marketable securities at June 30, 2012. We also have the ability to generate cash through our financing arrangements under our U.S. short-term commercial paper program and our U.S. and Canadian short-term reverse repurchase agreements to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Of the cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held at June 30, 2012, approximately $0.5 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries, if repatriated to the U.S., would generally be subject to foreign withholding and U.S. income taxes, adjusted for foreign tax credits. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our United States operations.
Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,910.2 million for fiscal 2012, as compared to $1,705.8 million for fiscal 2011. The increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities was due to higher net earnings, lower pension plan contributions of $66.5 million and a favorable change in the net components of working capital, partially offset by a variance in the timing of tax-related net cash payments of $162.7 million.
Net cash flows provided by investing activities were $3,243.6 million for fiscal 2012, as compared to net cash flows used in investing activities of $7,340.6 million fiscal 2011. The net increase in cash provided by investing activities was due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations of $9,692.1 million, a decrease of $510.3 million related to cash used for business acquisitions, and an increase of $58.5 million in cash receipts related to the sale of property, plant and equipment and other assets.
Net cash flows used in financing activities were $4,953.9 million for fiscal 2012 as compared to net cash flows provided by financing activities of $5,339.2 million for fiscal 2011. The increase in cash used was due to the net change in client funds obligations of $10,017.5 million as a result of the timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds and lower proceeds received from our stock purchase plan and the exercises of stock options. We purchased approximately 14.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $51.26 during fiscal 2012 compared to purchases of 14.2 million shares at an average price per share of $51.52 fiscal 2011. From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs. The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.
Our U.S. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained through a short-term commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $6.75 billion in aggregate maturity value of commercial paper. Our commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poors and Prime-1 by Moodys. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. For fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, the Companys average borrowings were $2.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. The weighted average maturity of the Companys commercial paper approximated two days in both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011. We have successfully borrowed through the use of our commercial paper program on an as needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. At June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2011 we had no outstanding obligations under our short-term commercial paper program.
33 Our U.S. and Canadian short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. We have $3.0 billion available to us on a committed basis under these reverse repurchase agreements. We believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the committed reverse repurchase agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $3.0 billion available to us under the committed reverse repurchase agreements. In fiscal 2012 and 2011, we had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of $297.7 million and $505.2 million, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively. We have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. At June 30, 2012 and 2011 we had no outstanding obligations under reverse repurchase agreements.
We have a $2.0 billion, 364-day credit agreement with a group of lenders that matures in June 2013. In addition, we have a four-year $3.25 billion credit facility maturing in June 2015 that contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500.0 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. We also have a $1.5 billion five-year credit facility that matures in June 2017 that also contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500.0 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The interest rate applicable to committed borrowings is tied to LIBOR, the federal funds effective rate, or the prime rate depending on the notification provided by the Company to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing. The Company is also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. We had no borrowings through June 30, 2012 under the credit agreements. We believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $6.75 billion available to us under the revolving credit agreements.
Our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of subprime mortgages, alternative-A mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or sub-prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, asset-backed commercial paper, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment grade fixed-income securities. Furthermore, we do not hold direct investments in sovereign debt issued by Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, or Spain. We own AAA rated senior tranches of fixed rate credit card, rate reduction and auto loan receivables, secured predominately by prime collateral. All collateral on asset-backed securities is performing as expected. In addition, we own senior debt directly issued by Federal Home Loan Banks, Federal Farm Credit Banks, Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae"), and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac"). We do not own subordinated debt, preferred stock or common stock of any of these agencies. We do own mortgage-backed securities, which represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a group or pool of one or more residential mortgages. These securities are collateralized by the cash flows of 15-year and 30-year residential mortgages and are guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as to the timely payment of principal and interest. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). This investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations.
34 Capital expenditures for continuing operations in fiscal 2012 were $146.2 million, as compared to $184.8 million in fiscal 2011 and $90.2 million in fiscal 2010. The capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 related to our data center and other facility improvements were made to support our operations. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 to be between $160 million and $180 million.
The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2012: (In millions) Payments due by period Less than 1-3 3-5 More than Contractual Obligations 1 year years years 5 years Unknown Total Debt Obligations     (1) $ 17.5 $ 4.6 $ 5.1 $ 7.8 $ - $ 35.0 Operating Lease and       Software License Obligations       (2) $ 173.7 $ 217.9 $ 70.4 $ 26.6 $ - $ 488.6 Purchase Obligations       (3) $ 350.5 $ 264.0 $ 183.4 $ - $ - $ 797.9 Obligations related to       Unrecognized $ 7.0 $ - $ - $ - $ 77.7 $ 84.7 Tax Benefits     (4) Other long-term       liabilities reflected on our Consolidated       Balance Sheets: Compensation and Benefits       (5) $ 78.7 $ 153.1 $ 94.1 $ 216.2 $ 33.6 $ 575.7 Acquisition-related       obligations (6) $ 14.8 $ 13.5 $ - $ - $ - $ 28.3 Total $ 642.2 $ 653.1 $ 353.0 $ 250.6 $ 111.3 $ 2,010.2 (1) These amounts represent the       principal repayments of our debt and are included on our Consolidated       Balance Sheets. The estimated interest payments due by corresponding       period above are $0.8 million, $1.5 million, $1.3 million, and $0.3       million, respectively, which have been excluded.
(2) Included in these amounts are       various facilities and equipment leases and software license agreements.       We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating       to facilities and equipment, as well as the licensing of software. The       majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the       passage of time. Certain facility and equipment leases require payment of       maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based       on future adjustments in price indices. Our future operating lease       obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into       additional operating lease agreements.
(3) Purchase obligations primarily       relate to purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment       and other assets.
(4) We made the determination that       net cash payments expected to be paid within the next 12 months, related       to unrecognized tax benefits of $84.7 million at June 30, 2012, are       expected to be up to $7 million. We are unable to make reasonably reliable       estimates as to the period beyond the next 12 months in which cash       payments related to unrecognized tax benefits are expected to be       paid.
(5) Compensation and benefits       primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans       and other compensation arrangements.
(6) Acquisition-related obligations       relate to contingent consideration for business acquisitions for which the       amount of contingent consideration was determinable at the date of       acquisition and therefore included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a       liability.
In addition to the obligations quantified in the table above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services. As of June 30, 2012, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2013, total $20,856.2 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We had $21,539.1 million of cash and marketable securities that have been impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2012.
35 ADP Indemnity provides workers compensation and employers liability deductible reimbursement protection for PEO Services worksite employees up to a $1 million per occurrence retention. PEO Services has secured specific per occurrence and aggregate stop loss insurance from a select wholly-owned and regulated insurance carrier of AIG that covers all losses in excess of the $1 million per occurrence retention and also any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level in each policy year. We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the PEO business. Premiums are charged to the PEO to cover the PEO Services worksite employee expected claim expenses. Changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are recognized by ADP Indemnity, Inc. At June 30, 2012, ADP Indemnitys total assets were $320.9 million to satisfy the actuarially estimated cost of workers compensation claims of $239.1 million for the policy years since July 1, 2003. In fiscal 2012 and 2011, ADP Indemnity paid claims of $64.1 million and $63.3 million, respectively. Should AIG and its wholly-owned insurance company be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations, ADP would become responsible for satisfying the worksite employee workers compensation obligations.
In the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. We do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and long-term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees).
Our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities. These assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury and/or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes. All of our short-term and long-term fixed-income securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
Our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals. Consistent with those goals, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income. Client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents. At June 30, 2012, approximately 92% of the available-for-sale securities categorized as U.S. Treasury and direct obligations of U.S. government agencies were invested in senior, unsecured, non-callable debt directly issued by the Federal Home Loan Banks, Federal Farm Credit Banks, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
We utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). As part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. We minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such clients obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the clients funds in advance of the timing of payment of such clients obligation. As a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations.
36 There are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets. Such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations. However, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations. We also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $6.75 billion commercial paper program (rated A-1+ by Standard and Poors and Prime-1 (P1) by Moodys, the highest possible credit rating), our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions ($3.0 billion of which is available on a committed basis) and available borrowings under our $6.75 billion committed revolving credit facilities. However, the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business. In addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below.
We have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments. The minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate and Canadian provincial bonds is BBB, for asset-backed securities is AAA, and for municipal bonds is A. The maximum maturity at time of purchase for BBB rated securities is 5 years, for single A rated securities is 7 years, and for AA rated and AAA rated securities is 10 years. Commercial paper and time deposits must be rated A1/P1.
Details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows: (Dollars in millions) Years ended June 30, 2012 2011 2010 Average investment       balances at cost: Corporate investments $ 4,024.6 $ 3,467.6 $ 3,839.2 Funds held for       clients 17,898.2 16,865.4 15,194.5 Total $ 21,922.8 $ 20,333.0 $ 19,033.7 Average interest rates       earned exclusive of realized gains/(losses)       on: Corporate investments 2.1 % 2.6 % 2.6 % Funds held for       clients 2.8 % 3.2 % 3.6 % Total 2.6 % 3.1 % 3.4 % Realized gains on       available-for-sale securities $ 32.1 $ 38.0 $ 15.0 Realized losses on available-for-sale       securities (7.7 ) (3.6 ) (13.4 ) Net realized gains on       available-for-sale securities $ 24.4 $ 34.4 $ 1.6 Impairment losses on available-for-sale securities $ (5.8 ) $ - $ (14.4 ) As of June 30: Net unrealized pre-tax gains on       available-for-sale securities $ 710.5 $ 570.9 $ 710.9 Total available-for-sale       securities at fair value $ 18,093.4 $ 16,927.5 $ 15,517.0 We are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested. Factors that influence the earnings impact of the interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments. This mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes. The annualized interest rates earned on our entire portfolio decreased 50 basis points, from 3.1% for fiscal 2011 to 2.6% for fiscal 2012. A hypothetical change in both short-term interest rates ( e.g ., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $10 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending June 30, 2013. A hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $5 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending June 30, 2013.
37 We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities. We limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily AAA and AA rated securities, as rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors, and for Canadian securities, Dominion Bond Rating Service. At June 30, 2012, approximately 84% of our available-for-sale securities held an AAA or AA rating. In addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than U.S. and Canadian government or government agency securities (and securities carrying their guarantee).
We operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes.
During fiscal 2010, we were exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations on U.S. Dollar denominated short-term intercompany amounts payable by a Canadian subsidiary to a U.S. subsidiary of the Company in the amount of $178.6 million U.S. Dollars. In order to manage the exposure related to the foreign exchange fluctuations between the Canadian Dollar and the U.S. Dollar, the Canadian subsidiary entered into a foreign exchange forward contract, which obligated the Canadian subsidiary to buy $178.6 million U.S. dollars at a rate of 1.15 Canadian Dollars to each U.S. Dollar on December 1, 2009. Upon settlement of such contract on December 1, 2009, an additional foreign exchange forward contract was entered into that obligated the Canadian subsidiary to buy $29.4 million U.S. Dollars at a rate of 1.06 Canadian dollars to each U.S. Dollar on February 26, 2010. The net loss on the foreign exchange forward contracts of $15.8 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010 was recognized in earnings in fiscal 2010 and substantially offset the foreign currency mark-to-market gains on the related short-term intercompany amounts payable. The short-term intercompany amounts payable were fully paid by the Canadian subsidiary to the U.S. subsidiary by February 2010.
There were no derivative financial instruments outstanding at June 30, 2012, 2011, or 2010.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In January 2012, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2011-03, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Reconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase Agreements. ASU 2011-03 revises the criteria for assessing effective control for repurchase agreements and other agreements that both entitle and obligate a transferor to repurchase or redeem financial assets before their maturity. The determination of whether the transfer of a financial asset subject to a repurchase agreement is a sale is based, in part, on whether the entity maintains effective control over the financial asset. ASU 2011-03 removes from the assessment of effective control: the criterion requiring the transferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial asset on substantially the agreed terms, even in the event of default by the transferee, and the related requirement to demonstrate that the transferor possesses adequate collateral to fund substantially all the cost of purchasing replacement financial assets. The adoption of ASU 2011-03 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
38 In January 2012, we adopted ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. ASU 2011-04 requires expansion of the disclosures required for Level 3 measurements of fair value and provides updates to the existing measurement guidance. The adoption of ASU 2011-04 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income. ASU 2011-05 requires entities to present net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income. ASU 2011-05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011-05 will not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. ASU 2011-08 amends the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350-20 on testing goodwill for impairment. ASU 2011-08 permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value based upon the qualitative assessment, it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test. ASU 2011-08 does not change how goodwill is calculated or assigned to reporting units, nor does it revise the requirement to test goodwill annually for impairment. ASU 2011-08 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011-08 will not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
Revenue Recognition . Our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services ( e.g.
, Employer Services payroll processing fees) as well as investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds and other Employer Services client-related funds. We enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction ( e.g.
, number of payees or number of payrolls processed). Fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Our service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties. Interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services.
We also recognize revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses (e.g., Dealer Services dealer management systems). For a majority of our software sales arrangements, which provide hardware, software licenses, installation, and post-contract customer support, revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term, as vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendor-specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition.
39 We assess collectability of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customers payment history. We do not believe that a change in our assumptions utilized in the collectability determination would result in a material change to revenues as no single customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues.
Goodwill . We account for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in accordance with ASC 350-10, which states that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. We perform this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount. If an indicator of impairment exists based upon comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount, we would then compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment, if any. We determine the fair value of our reporting units using an equal weighted blended approach, which combines the income approach, which is the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital; and the market approach, which is based on using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business. We had $3,155.3 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2012. Based on the fair value analysis completed in the fourth quarter of 2012, management concluded that fair value exceeded carrying value for all reporting units. In completing the annual impairment test for fiscal 2012, we evaluated the reasonableness of differences noted between the fair value and carrying value of each reporting unit. Given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated earnings if we are unable to generate the anticipated revenue growth, synergies and/or cost savings associated with our acquisitions.
Income Taxes.
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns ( e.g.
, realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
There is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Specifically, the likelihood of an entitys tax benefits being sustained must be more likely than not assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements. If a tax position drops below the more likely than not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes. A change in the assessment of the more likely than not standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. As of June 30, 2012 and 2011, the Companys liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $84.7 million and $105.7 million, respectively.
If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. Based on current estimates, settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to $10 million in the next twelve months. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
40 Stock-Based Compensation.
We measure stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. The binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Determining these assumptions is subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Automatic Data Processing, Inc.
Roseland, New Jersey We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2012. Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2. These consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

45 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A. Basis of Preparation.
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and its subsidiaries (ADP or the Company) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses and accumulated other comprehensive income that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
B. Description of Business.
The Company is a provider of technology-based outsourcing solutions to employers and vehicle retailers and manufacturers. The Company classifies its operations into the following reportable segments: Employer Services, Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services, and Dealer Services. The primary components of the Other segment are the results of operations of ADP Indemnity (a wholly-owned captive insurance company that provides workers compensation and employers liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services worksite employees), non-recurring gains and losses, miscellaneous processing services, such as customer financing transactions, and certain expenses that have not been charged to the reportable segments, such as stock-based compensation expense.
C. Revenue Recognition.
Revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services ( e.g., Employer Services payroll processing fees) as well as investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds and other Employer Services client-related funds. The Company enters into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction ( e.g., number of payees or number of payrolls processed). Fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties.
Interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services.
The Company also recognizes revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses (e.g., Dealer Services dealer management systems). For a majority of our software sales arrangements, which provide hardware, software licenses, installation, and post-contract customer support, revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term, as vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist.
The Company assesses the collectability of revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customers payment history.
PEO revenues are reported on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings and are reported net of direct pass-through costs, which are costs billed and incurred for PEO Services worksite employees, primarily consisting of payroll wages and payroll taxes. Benefits, workers compensation and state unemployment tax fees for worksite employees are included in PEO revenues and the associated costs are included in operating expenses.
46 D. Cash and Cash Equivalents.
Investment securities with a maturity of ninety days or less at the time of purchase are considered cash equivalents. The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates carrying value.
E. Corporate Investments and Funds Held for Clients.
All of the Companys marketable securities are considered to be available-for-sale and, accordingly, are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities are determined on a specific-identification basis and are included in other income, net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.
If the fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost, the Company assesses whether it intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery. If either of those two conditions were met, the Company would recognize a charge in earnings equal to the entire difference between the securitys amortized cost basis and its fair value. If the Company does not intend to sell a security or it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, the unrealized loss is separated into an amount representing the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other factors, which is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related available-for-sale security as an adjustment to yield using the effective-interest method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
F. Long-term Receivables.
Long-term receivables relate to notes receivable from the sale of computer systems, primarily to auto, truck, motorcycle, marine, recreational vehicle and heavy equipment retailers and manufacturers. Unearned income from finance receivables represents the excess of gross receivables over the sales price of the computer systems financed. Unearned income is amortized using the effective-interest method to maintain a constant rate of return over the term of each contract.
The allowance for doubtful accounts on long-term receivables is the Companys best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses related to the Companys existing note receivables.
G. Property, Plant and Equipment.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. The estimated useful lives of assets are primarily as follows: Data processing equipment 2 to 5 years Buildings 20 to 40 years Furniture and fixtures 3 to 7 years H. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are instead tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. The Company performs this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount. If an indicator of impairment exists based upon comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount, the Company would then compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment, if any. The Company determines the estimated fair value of its reporting units using an equal weighted blended approach, which combines the income approach, which is the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital; and the market approach, which is based on using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business.
47 I. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.
J. Foreign Currency Translation.
The net assets of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect for each period, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in the periods. Gains or losses from balance sheet translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Currency transaction gains or losses, which are included in the results of operations, are immaterial for all periods presented.
K. Derivative Financial Instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and are recognized as assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in the fair value of the derivatives recognized in either net earnings from continuing operations or accumulated other comprehensive income, depending on the timing and designated purpose of the derivative.
There were no derivative financial instruments outstanding at June 30, 2012 or June 30, 2011.
L. Earnings per Share (EPS).
The calculations of basic and diluted EPS are as follows: Effect of Effect of Employee Employee Stock Option Restricted Stock Years ended June 30, Basic Shares Shares Diluted 2012 Net earnings from continuing       operations $ 1,388.5 $ 1,388.5 Weighted average shares       (in millions) 487.3 3.8 1.1 492.2 EPS       from continuing operations $ 2.85 $ 2.82 2011 Net earnings from continuing       operations $ 1,254.2 $ 1,254.2 Weighted average shares       (in millions) 493.5 3.8 1.0 498.3 EPS       from continuing operations $ 2.54 $ 2.52 2010 Net earnings from continuing       operations $ 1,207.3 $ 1,207.3 Weighted average shares       (in millions) 500.5 2.2 1.0 503.7 EPS       from continuing operations $ 2.41 $ 2.40 Options to purchase 0.9 million, 0.9 million, and 14.0 million shares of common stock for the year ended June 30, 2012, (fiscal 2012), the year ended June 30, 2011, (fiscal 2011), and the year ended June 30, 2010 (fiscal 2010), respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their exercise prices exceeded the average market price of outstanding common shares for the respective fiscal year.
M. Stock-Based Compensation.
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense in net earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant. The Company determines the fair value of stock options issued using a binomial option-pricing model. The binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of the Companys stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of a stock option grant is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
48 N. Internal Use Software.
Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a three- to five-year period on a straight-line basis. For software developed or obtained for internal use, the Company capitalizes costs. The Companys policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. In addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. The Company also expenses internal costs related to minor upgrades and enhancements, as it is impractical to separate these costs from normal maintenance activities.
O. Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed.
The Company capitalizes certain costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed. The Companys policy provides for the capitalization of all software production costs upon reaching technological feasibility for a specific product. Technological feasibility is attained when software products have a completed working model whose consistency with the overall product design has been confirmed by testing. Costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. The establishment of technological feasibility requires judgment by management and in many instances is only attained a short time prior to the general release of the software. Upon the general release of the software product to customers, capitalization ceases and such costs are amortized over a three-year period on a straight-line basis. Maintenance-related costs are expensed as incurred.
P. Income Taxes.
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. The Company is subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities.
There is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Specifically, the likelihood of an entitys tax benefits being sustained must be more likely than not, assuming that these positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements. If a tax position drops below the more likely than not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes. As of June 30, 2012 and 2011, the Companys liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $84.7 million, and $105.7 million respectively.
If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. Based on current estimates, settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to $10.0 million. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
49 Q. Workers Compensation Costs.
The Company employs a third party actuary to assist in determining the estimated claim liability related to workers compensation and employers liability coverage for PEO Services worksite employees. In estimating ultimate loss rates, we utilize historical loss experience, exposure data, and actuarial judgment, together with a range of inputs which are primarily based upon the worksite employees job responsibilities, their location, the historical frequency and severity of workers compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. For each reporting period, changes in the actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers compensation claims cost estimates. The Company has secured specific per occurrence insurance that caps the exposure for each claim at $1 million per occurrence, and has also secured aggregate stop loss insurance that caps aggregate losses at a certain level in each policy year.
R. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.
In January 2012, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2011-03, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Reconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase Agreements. ASU 2011-03 revises the criteria for assessing effective control for repurchase agreements and other agreements that both entitle and obligate a transferor to repurchase or redeem financial assets before their maturity. The determination of whether the transfer of a financial asset subject to a repurchase agreement is a sale is based, in part, on whether the entity maintains effective control over the financial asset. ASU 2011-03 removes from the assessment of effective control: the criterion requiring the transferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial asset on substantially the agreed terms, even in the event of default by the transferee, and the related requirement to demonstrate that the transferor possesses adequate collateral to fund substantially all the cost of purchasing replacement financial assets. The adoption of ASU 2011-03 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
In January 2012, the Company adopted ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. ASU 2011-04 requires expansion of the disclosures required for Level 3 measurements of fair value and provides updates to the existing measurement guidance. The adoption of ASU 2011-04 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income. ASU 2011-05 requires entities to present net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income. ASU 2011-05 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011-05 will not have an impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. ASU 2011-08 amends the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350-20 on testing goodwill for impairment. ASU 2011-08 permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value based upon the qualitative assessment, it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test. ASU 2011-08 does not change how goodwill is calculated or assigned to reporting units, nor does it revise the requirement to test goodwill annually for impairment. ASU 2011-08 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011-08 will not have an impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
50 NOTE 2. OTHER INCOME, NET Other income, net consists of the following: Years ended June 30, 2012 2011 2010 Interest income on       corporate funds $ (85.2 ) $ (88.8 ) $ (98.8 ) Realized gains on available-for-sale       securities (32.1 ) (38.0 ) (15.0 ) Realized losses on       available-for-sale securities 7.7 3.6 13.4 Realized gains on investment in       Reserve Fund - (0.9 ) (15.2 ) Impairment losses on       available-for-sale securities 5.8 - 14.4 Impairment losses on assets held for       sale 2.2 11.7 - Gain on sale of       assets (66.0 ) - - Net (gains) losses on sales of       buildings - (1.8 ) 2.3 Other, net (3.2 ) (2.4 ) (2.3 ) Other income, net $ (170.8 ) $ (116.6 ) $ (101.2 ) Proceeds from sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities were $3,962.2 million, $3,305.1 million, and $3,406.9 million for fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
During fiscal 2012, the Company sold assets related to rights and obligations to resell a third party expense management platform and, as a result, recorded a gain of $66.0 million in other income, net, on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.
During fiscal 2011 and 2010, the Company received distributions from the Reserve Fund in excess of what was previously recorded in short-term marketable securities and, as such, recorded gains of $0.9 million and $15.2 million, respectively, to other income, net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.
In fiscal 2012 and 2010, the Company concluded it had the intent to sell certain securities for which unrealized losses of $5.8 million and $14.4 million, respectively, were previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As such, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $5.8 million and $14.4 million in other income, net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings during fiscal 2012 and 2010. As of June 30, 2012, all such securities had been sold.
In fiscal 2012, the Company completed the sale of two buildings for their combined carrying value of $6.9 million, net of selling costs. The Company had previously classified these assets as assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognized impairment losses within other income, net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings of $2.2 million and $11.7 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. During fiscal years 2011 and 2010, the Company sold buildings that were previously classified as assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and, as a result, recorded net gains/(losses) of $1.8 million and ($2.3) million, respectively, in other income, net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.
The Company had an outsourcing agreement with Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (Broadridge) pursuant to which the Company provided data center outsourcing services, which principally consisted of information technology services and service delivery network services. As a result of this agreement, the Company recognized income of $112.0 million, $113.0 million and $104.8 million in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, which was offset by expenses associated with providing such services of $109.8 million, $110.8 million and $102.6 million, respectively, both of which were recorded in other income, net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings. The Company had a receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets from Broadridge for the services under this agreement of $7.6 million and $9.5 million on June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In fiscal 2010, Broadridge notified the Company that it would not extend the outsourcing agreement beyond its current expiration date of June 30, 2012. The expiration of the outsourcing agreement did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations.
51 NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations were recorded on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the respective acquisition dates based upon their estimated fair values at such dates. The results of operations of businesses acquired by the Company have been included in the Statements of Consolidated Earnings since their respective dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill. In certain circumstances, the allocations of the excess purchase price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions and subject to revision when the Company receives final information, including appraisals and other analyses. Accordingly, the measurement period for such purchase price allocations will end when the information, or the facts and circumstances, becomes available, but will not exceed twelve months.
The Company acquired seven businesses in fiscal 2012 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $301.0 million, net of cash acquired. In addition to the cash consideration related to acquisitions closed during fiscal 2012, the Company accrued certain liabilities, which represent the estimated fair value of contingent consideration (earn-out) expected to be payable in the event that certain specific performance metrics are achieved over the earn-out period. At June 30, 2012, the Company had not yet finalized the purchase price allocation for these seven acquisitions. These acquisitions resulted in approximately $182.4 million of goodwill. Intangible assets acquired, which total approximately $90.0 million for these seven acquisitions, included customer contracts and lists, software and trademarks that are being amortized over a weighted average life of approximately 11 years.
On August 16, 2010, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Cobalt, a leading provider of digital marketing solutions for the auto industry that aligns with Dealer Services global layered applications strategy and strongly supports Dealer Services long-term growth strategy, for approximately $405.4 million in cash, net of cash acquired.
The final purchase price allocation for Cobalt was as follows: Accounts receivable, net $ 42.5 Goodwill 293.5 Identifiable intangible assets 111.6 Other assets 37.5 Total assets acquired $ 485.1 Total liabilities acquired $ 58.0 The Company determined the purchase price allocations for this acquisition based on estimates of the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, utilizing recognized valuation techniques, including the income and market approaches. Goodwill for Cobalt, which is not deductible for tax purposes, resulted from the expected impact to Dealer Services long-term growth strategy. Intangible assets for Cobalt, which totaled $111.6 million, included customer contracts and lists, software and trademarks that are being amortized over a weighted average life of approximately 11 years. There is no contingent consideration relating to the Cobalt acquisition.
52 In addition to Cobalt discussed above, the Company acquired eight businesses in fiscal 2011 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $370.7 million, net of cash acquired. These acquisitions resulted in approximately $250.2 million of goodwill. Intangible assets acquired, which totaled approximately $134.8 million for these eight acquisitions, included customer contracts and lists, software and trademarks that are being amortized over a weighted average life of approximately 9 years. The Company finalized the purchase price allocation for these eight acquisitions during fiscal 2012 and adjusted the preliminary values allocated to certain assets and liabilities in order to reflect final information received.
The Company acquired five businesses in fiscal 2010 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $101.0 million, net of cash acquired. The purchase price for these acquisitions includes $3.7 million in accrued contingent payments expected to be paid in future periods. These acquisitions resulted in approximately $80.8 million of goodwill. Intangible assets acquired, which totaled approximately $33.5 million, consist of software, customer contracts and lists and trademarks that are being amortized over a weighted average life of 7 years. The Company finalized the purchase price allocation for these five acquisitions during fiscal 2011 and adjusted the preliminary values allocated to certain assets and liabilities in order to reflect final information received.
In addition, the Company made contingent payments relating to previously consummated acquisitions of $2.8 million, $0.8 million and, $2.6 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010 respectively.
The acquisitions discussed above for fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010 were not material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows.
53 NOTE 4. DIVESTITURES On March 24, 2010, the Company completed its sale of the non-core Commercial Systems business (the Commercial business) for approximately $21.6 million in cash. The Commercial business was previously reported in the Dealer Services segment. In connection with the disposal of this business, the Company has classified the results of this business as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Additionally, in fiscal 2010, the Company reported a gain of $5.6 million, or $1.0 million after taxes, within earnings from discontinued operations on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.
During fiscal 2010, the Company recorded net charges of $0.5 million within earnings from discontinued operations related to a change in estimated taxes on the divestitures of businesses of $0.8 million, partially offset by a change in professional fees incurred in connection with the divestitures of businesses of $0.3 million.
There were no revenues and earnings from discontinued operations during fiscal 2012 and 2011. The following table summarizes the revenues and expenses from discontinued operations as reported for the period indicated: Year ended June 30, 2010 Revenues $ 17.2 Earnings from discontinued       operations before income taxes 5.2 Provision for income taxes 1.6 Net earnings from       discontinued operations before gain on disposal of       discontinued operations 3.6 Gain on disposal of       discontinued operations, net of provision for income       taxes of $5.4 0.5 Net earnings from       discontinued operations $ 4.1 There were no assets or liabilities of discontinued operations as of June 30, 2012, 2011, or 2010.

The unrealized losses and fair values of available-for-sale securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for a period of less than and greater than 12 months as of June 30, 2012 are as follows: Unrealized Unrealized losses Fair market losses Fair market Total gross less than value less than greater than value greater unrealized Total fair 12 months 12 months 12 months than 12 months losses market value U.S. Treasury and direct       obligations of U.S. government       agencies $ (0.1 ) $ 43.6 $ - $ - $ (0.1 ) $ 43.6 Corporate bonds (1.1 ) 234.8 (0.4 ) 20.2 (1.5 ) 255.0 Canadian provincial       bonds (0.3 ) 58.5 - - (0.3 ) 58.5 Asset-backed securities - 13.6 - - - 13.6 Municipal bonds (0.1 ) 22.8 - - (0.1 ) 22.8 Canadian government obligations       and Canadian government agency obligations (0.6 ) 209.4 - - (0.6 ) 209.4 Other securities (0.1 ) 26.3 - - (0.1 ) 26.3 $ (2.3 ) $ 609.0 $ (0.4 ) $ 20.2 $ (2.7 ) $ 629.2 57 The unrealized losses and fair values of available-for-sale securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for a period of less than and greater than 12 months as of June 30, 2011 are as follows: Unrealized Unrealized losses Fair market losses Fair market Total gross less than value less than greater than value greater unrealized Total fair 12 months 12 months 12 months than 12 months losses market value U.S. Treasury and direct       obligations of U.S. government       agencies $ (12.1 ) $ 1,049.0 $ - $ - $ (12.1 ) $ 1,049.0 Corporate bonds (16.9 ) 945.2 - - (16.9 ) 945.2 Canadian provincial       bonds (0.8 ) 88.5 - - (0.8 ) 88.5 Asset-backed securities - 0.5 - - - 0.5 Municipal bonds (0.6 ) 35.0 - - (0.6 ) 35.0 Canadian government obligations       and Canadian government agency obligations (1.3 ) 227.7 - - (1.3 ) 227.7 Other securities (2.9 ) 171.1 - - (2.9 ) 171.1 $ (34.6 ) $ 2,517.0 $ - $ - $ (34.6 ) $ 2,517.0 Expected maturities of available-for-sale securities at June 30, 2012 are as follows: Maturity Dates: Due in one year or less $ 2,984.5 Due after one year       up to two years 1,617.1 Due after two years up to three years 3,435.2 Due after three       years up to four years 4,054.4 Due after four years 6,002.2 Total available-for-sale       securities $ 18,093.4 For the securities in an unrealized loss position of $2.7 million at June 30, 2012, the Company concluded that it did not have the intent to sell such securities and that it was not more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell such securities before recovery. The securities with unrealized losses of $2.7 million were primarily comprised of corporate bonds and Canadian government obligations and Canadian government agency obligations. In order to determine whether such losses were due to credit losses, the Company evaluated such securities utilizing a variety of quantitative and qualitative factors including whether the Company expects to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the security, information about current and past events of the issuer, and the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost basis. At June 30, 2012, the Company concluded that unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities held at June 30, 2012 were not credit losses and were attributable to changes in interest rates. As a result, the Company concluded that the $2.7 million in unrealized losses on such securities should be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2012.
58 NOTE 6. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is based upon the Companys principal or most advantageous market for a specific asset or liability.
U.S. GAAP provides for a three-level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value, defined as follows: Level       1 Fair value       is determined based upon quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities       that are traded in active markets.
Level       2 Fair value       is determined based upon inputs other than quoted prices included in Level       1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or       indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability,       including: quoted       prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted       prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are       not active; inputs other       than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability;       or inputs that       are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by       correlation or other means.
Level       3 Fair value       is determined based upon inputs that are unobservable and reflect the       Companys own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants       would use in pricing the asset or liability based upon the best       information available in the circumstances (e.g., internally derived       assumptions surrounding the timing and amount of expected cash       flows).
Available-for-sale securities included in Level 1 are valued using closing prices for identical instruments that are traded on active exchanges. Over 99% of the Companys available-for-sale securities included in Level 2 are valued utilizing inputs obtained from an independent pricing service. To determine the fair value of the Companys Level 2 investments, a variety of inputs are utilized, including benchmark yields, reported trades, non-binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, new issue data, and monthly payment information. The Company reviews the values generated by the independent pricing service for reasonableness by comparing the valuations received from the independent pricing service to valuations from at least one other observable source. The Company has not adjusted the prices obtained from the independent pricing service. The Company has no available-for-sale securities included in Level 3.
The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the classification of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy. In certain instances, the inputs used to measure fair value may meet the definition of more than one level of the fair value hierarchy. The significant input with the lowest level priority is used to determine the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy.

RECEIVABLES Accounts receivable, net, includes the Companys trade receivables, which are recorded based upon the amount the Company expects to receive from its clients, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Companys receivables also include notes receivable for the financing of the sale of computer systems, primarily from auto, truck, motorcycle, marine, recreational vehicle and heavy equipment retailers and manufacturers. Notes receivable are recorded based upon the amount the Company expects to receive from its clients, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and unearned income. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company's best estimate of probable credit losses related to trade receivables and notes receivable based upon the aging of the receivables, historical collection data, internal assessments of credit quality and the economic conditions in the automobile industry, as well as in the economy as a whole. The Company charges off uncollectable amounts against the reserve in the period in which it determines they are uncollectable. Unearned income on notes receivable is amortized using the effective interest method.
60 The Companys receivables, whose carrying value approximates fair value, are as follows: June 30, 2012 June 30, 2011 Current Long-term Current Long-term Trade receivables $ 1,363.7 $ - $ 1,333.2 $ - Notes       receivable 89.1 145.5 90.5 146.4 Less: Allowance for doubtful       accounts - trade receivables (41.1 ) - (44.8 ) - Allowance for doubtful       accounts - notes receivable (5.4 ) (8.8 ) (5.7 ) (9.4 ) Unearned income-notes       receivable (7.0 ) (6.9 ) (8.4 ) (8.3 ) Total $ 1,399.3 $ 129.8 $ 1,364.8 $ 128.7 Long-term receivables at June 30, 2012 mature as follows: 2014 $ 66.0 2015 $ 43.5 2016 $ 26.1 2017 $ 9.9 $ 145.5 The Company determines the allowance for doubtful accounts related to notes receivable based upon a specific reserve for known collection issues, as well as a non-specific reserve based upon aging, both of which are based upon history of such losses and current economic conditions. Based upon the Companys methodology, the notes receivable balances with specific and non-specific reserves and the specific and non-specific reserves associated with those balances are as follows: June 30, 2012 Notes Receivable Reserve Current Long-term Current Long-term Specific Reserve $ 0.4 $ 0.6 $ 0.4 $ 0.6 Non-specific       Reserve 88.7 144.9 5.0 8.2 Total $ 89.1 $ 145.5 $ 5.4 $ 8.8 June 30, 2011 Notes Receivable Reserve Current Long-term Current Long-term Specific Reserve $ 0.6 $ 0.9 $ 0.6 $ 0.9 Non-specific       Reserve 89.9 145.5 5.1 8.5 Total $ 90.5 $ 146.4 $ 5.7 $ 9.4 61 The rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts related to notes receivable is as follows: Current Long-term Balance at June 30, 2010 $ 9.4 $ 16.1 Incremental       provision 1.8 3.0 Recoveries (3.7 ) (6.8 ) Chargeoffs (1.8 ) (2.9 ) Balance at June 30, 2011 $ 5.7 $ 9.4 Incremental       provision 1.7 2.1 Recoveries (1.1 ) (1.5 ) Chargeoffs (0.9 ) (1.2 ) Balance at June 30, 2012 $ 5.4 $ 8.8 The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of notes receivable was approximately 6% as of June 30, 2012 and 6% as of June 30, 2011.
Notes receivable aged over 30 days past due are considered delinquent. Notes receivable aged over 60 days past due and notes receivable with known collection issues are placed on non-accrual status. Interest revenue is not recognized on notes receivable while on non-accrual status. Cash payments received on non-accrual receivables are applied towards the principal. When notes receivable on non-accrual status are again less than 60 days past due, recognition of interest revenue for notes receivable is resumed. At June 30, 2012, the Company had $0.4 million in notes receivable on non-accrual status, including $0.1 million of notes receivable aged over 60 days past due. At June 30, 2011, the Company had $2.2 million in notes receivable on non-accrual status, including $0.1 million of notes receivable aged over 60 days past due. During fiscal 2012 and 2011, the charge-offs as a percentage of notes receivable were 0.9% and 1.9% respectively.
On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates the credit quality of its financing receivables, utilizing aging of receivables, collection experience and charge-offs. In addition, the Company evaluates economic conditions in the auto industry and specific dealership matters, such as bankruptcy. As events related to a specific client dictate, the credit quality of a client is reevaluated.
The aging of the notes receivable past due at June 30, 2012 is as follows: Over       30 days to 60 days Over 60 days Notes Receivables $ 0.7 $ 0.1 At June 30, 2012, approximately 100% of notes receivable are current.
The aging of the notes receivable past due at June 30, 2011 is as follows: Over       30 days to 60 days Over 60 days Notes Receivables $ 1.2 $ 0.1 At June 30, 2011, approximately 99% of notes receivable are current.
62 NOTE 8. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment at cost and accumulated depreciation at June 30, 2012 and 2011 are as follows: June     30, 2012 2011 Property, plant and equipment: Land and buildings $ 710.4 $ 698.4 Data processing       equipment 815.4 791.0 Furniture, leaseholds and       other 431.6 462.3 1,957.4 1,951.7 Less: accumulated depreciation (1,251.1 ) (1,235.5 ) Property, plant and equipment, net $ 706.3 $ 716.2 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment was $146.9 million, $146.3 million, and $152.6 million for fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
NOTE 9. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE In fiscal 2012, the Company reclassified assets related to two buildings as assets held for sale which were previously reported in property, plant and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In fiscal 2011, the Company reclassified an additional two buildings as assets held for sale that were previously reported in property, plant and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These two buildings were subsequently sold during fiscal 2012. At June 30, 2010, the Company had $11.8 million classified as assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets relating to two buildings that were subsequently sold during fiscal 2011.
NOTE 10. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET Changes in goodwill for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 are as follows: Employer PEO Dealer Services Services Services Total Balance as of June 30, 2010 $ 1,611.3 $ 4.8 $ 767.2 $ 2,383.3 Additions and       other adjustments, net 251.3 - 332.9 584.2 Currency translation adjustments 72.4 - 33.7 106.1 Balance as of       June 30, 2011 $ 1,935.0 $ 4.8 $ 1,133.8 $ 3,073.6 Additions and other adjustments, net 106.8 - 56.2 163.0 Currency       translation adjustments (60.9 ) - (20.4 ) (81.3 ) Balance as of June 30, 2012 $ 1,980.9 $ 4.8 $ 1,169.6 $ 3,155.3 In fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, the Company performed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill and determined that there was no impairment.
63 Components of intangible assets are as follows: June     30, 2012 2011 Intangibles: Software and software       licenses $ 1,423.7 $ 1,322.4 Customer contracts and       lists 863.1 821.0 Other intangibles 241.9 238.3 2,528.7 2,381.7 Less accumulated amortization: Software and software       licenses (1,153.0 ) (1,062.1 ) Customer contracts and       lists (492.2 ) (443.7 ) Other intangibles (172.3 ) (160.2 ) (1,817.5 ) (1,666.0 ) Intangible assets, net $ 711.2 $ 715.7 Other intangibles consist primarily of purchased rights, covenants, patents and trademarks (acquired directly or through acquisitions). All of the intangible assets have finite lives and, as such, are subject to amortization. The weighted average remaining useful life of the intangible assets is 8 years (4 years for software and software licenses, 10 years for customer contracts and lists, and 8 years for other intangibles). Amortization of intangible assets was $176.4 million, $171.9 million, and $156.6 million for fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
Estimated amortization expenses of the Companys existing intangible assets for the next five fiscal years are as follows: Amount Twelve months ending June 30, 2013 $ 159.4 Twelve months       ending June 30, 2014 $ 129.9 Twelve months ending June 30, 2015 $ 99.3 Twelve months       ending June 30, 2016 $ 70.2 Twelve months ending June 30, 2017 $ 61.2 The Company has not incurred significant costs to renew or extend the term of acquired intangible assets during fiscal 2012.
NOTE 11. SHORT-TERM FINANCING The Company has a $2.0 billion, 364-day credit agreement with a group of lenders that matures in June 2013. In addition, the Company has a four-year $3.25 billion credit facility maturing in June 2015 that contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500.0 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The Company also has a $1.5 billion five-year credit facility that matures in June 2017 that also contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500.0 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The interest rate applicable to committed borrowings is tied to LIBOR, the federal funds effective rate or the prime rate depending on the notification provided by the Company to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing. The Company is also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. The Company had no borrowings through June 30, 2012 under the credit agreements.
The Companys U.S. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained through a short-term commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $6.75 billion in aggregate maturity value of commercial paper. The Companys commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poors and Prime-1 by Moodys. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities.
Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. At June 30, 2012 and 2011, the Company had no commercial paper outstanding. In fiscal 2012 and 2011, the Companys average borrowings were $2.3 billion and $1.6 billion, at weighted average interest rates of 0.1% and 0.2%. The weighted average maturity of the Companys commercial paper in fiscal 2012 and 2011 was approximately two days for both fiscal years.
64 The Companys U.S. and Canadian short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements. These agreements are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. The Company has $3.0 billion available to it on a committed basis under these reverse repurchase agreements. At June 30, 2012 and 2011, there were no outstanding obligations under reverse repurchase agreements. In fiscal 2012 and 2011, the Company had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of $297.7 million and $505.2 million, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively.
NOTE 12. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company uses derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes.
During fiscal 2010, the Company was exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations on U.S. Dollar denominated short-term intercompany amounts payable by a Canadian subsidiary to a U.S. subsidiary of the Company in the amount of $178.6 million U.S. Dollars. In order to manage the exposure related to the foreign exchange fluctuations between the Canadian Dollar and the U.S. Dollar, the Canadian subsidiary entered into a foreign exchange forward contract, which obligated the Canadian subsidiary to buy $178.6 million U.S. dollars at a rate of 1.15 Canadian Dollars to each U.S. Dollar on December 1, 2009. Upon settlement of such contract on December 1, 2009, an additional foreign exchange forward contract was entered into that obligated the Canadian subsidiary to buy $29.4 million U.S. Dollars at a rate of 1.06 Canadian dollars to each U.S. Dollar on February 26, 2010. The net loss on the foreign exchange forward contracts of $15.8 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010 was recognized in earnings in fiscal 2010 and substantially offset the foreign currency mark-to-market gains and losses on the related short-term intercompany amounts payable. The short-term intercompany amounts payable were fully paid by the Canadian subsidiary to the U.S. subsidiary by February 2010.
There were no derivative financial instruments outstanding at June 30, 2012, 2011, or 2010.
NOTE 13. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS A. Stock Plans.
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense in net earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation consists of the following: Stock   Options.
Stock options are granted to   employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company's   common stock on the dates of grant. Stock options are issued under a graded   vesting schedule. Options granted prior to July 1, 2008 generally vest ratably   over five years and have a term of 10 years.   Options granted after July 1, 2008 generally vest ratably over four years and   have a term of 10 years. Compensation expense for stock options is recognized   over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the   stock option award.
65 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
The   Company offers an employee stock purchase plan that allows eligible employees   to purchase shares of common stock at a price equal to 95% of the market value   for the Company's common stock on the last day of the offering period. This   plan has been deemed non-compensatory and therefore, no compensation expense   has been recorded.
Restricted Stock.
Time-Based Restricted Stock.
The Company has issued time-based   restricted stock to certain key employees. These shares are restricted as to   transfer and in certain circumstances must be returned to the Company at the   original purchase price. The Company records stock compensation expense   relating to the issuance of restricted stock based on market prices on the   date of grant on a straight-line basis over the period in which the transfer   restrictions exist, which is up to five years from the date of   grant.
Performance-Based Restricted Stock.
The performance-based restricted stock   program has a one-year performance period, and a subsequent six-month service   period. Under this program, the Company communicates "target awards" to   employees at the beginning of the performance period and, as such, dividends   are not paid in respect of the "target awards" during the performance period.   After the performance period, if the performance targets are achieved,   associates are eligible to receive dividends on shares awarded under the   program. The performance target is based on earnings per share growth over the   performance period, with possible payouts ranging from 0% to 150% of the   "target awards." Stock-based compensation expense is measured based upon the   fair value of the award on the grant date. Compensation expense is recognized   on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of approximately 18 months,   based upon the probability that the performance target will be met.
The Company currently utilizes treasury stock to satisfy stock option exercises, issuances under the Company's employee stock purchase plan and restricted stock awards. From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs. The Company repurchased 14.6 million shares in fiscal 2012 as compared to 14.2 million shares repurchased in fiscal 2011. The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.
Stock-based compensation expense of $78.7 million, $76.3 million, and $67.6 million was recognized in earnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, as well as related tax benefits of $29.0 million, $28.2 million, and $22.3 million, respectively.
Years ended June       30, 2012 2011 2010 Operating expenses $ 13.4 $ 13.1 $ 11.7 Selling, general       and administrative expenses 53.8 51.8 45.9 System development and programming costs 11.5 11.4 10.0 Total pretax       stock-based compensation expense $ 78.7 $ 76.3 $ 67.6 66 As of June 30, 2012, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options and restricted stock awards amounted to $8.8 million and $40.5 million, respectively, which will be amortized over the weighted average remaining requisite service period of 1.8 years and 1.0 years, respectively.
In fiscal 2012, the following activity occurred under our existing plans: Stock Options: Number of Options Weighted Average Price per Share Year ended June       30, 2012 (in thousands) (in dollars) Options outstanding, beginning of year 21,714 $40 Options       granted 1,136 $54 Options exercised (6,228 ) $40 Options       canceled (435 ) $42 Options outstanding, end of year 16,187 $41 Options exercisable, end of year 13,632 $39 Shares available       for future grants, end of year 29,452 Shares reserved for issuance under stock option plans, end of       year 45,639 Performance-Based Restricted Stock: Time-Based       Restricted Stock: Number of Shares Number of Shares (in thousands) (in thousands) Year ended June 30, 2012 Year ended June 30, 2012 Restricted shares outstanding, Restricted shares outstanding, beginning of year 1,351 beginning of year 493 Restricted       shares granted 1,801 Restricted       shares granted 31 Restricted shares vested (1,581 ) Restricted shares vested (144 ) Restricted       shares forfeited (97 ) Restricted       shares forfeited (22 ) Restricted shares outstanding, end of year 1,474 Restricted shares outstanding, end of year 358 The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding and exercisable as of June 30, 2012 was $245.0 million and $221.7 million, respectively, which has a remaining life of 4.1 years and 3.4 years, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value for stock options exercised in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010 was $83.8 million, $95.7 million and $29.1 million, respectively.
In fiscal 2010, the Company issued 1.4 million shares in connection with the final compensatory employee stock purchase plan offering that vested on December 31, 2009.
The fair value of each stock option issued is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option pricing model. The binomial model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of the Companys stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grant is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
67 The fair value for stock options granted was estimated at the date of grant using the following assumptions: Years ended June       30, 2012 2011 2010 Risk-free interest rate 0.8% - 1.0% 1.4% - 2.4% 2.3% - 2.6% Dividend       yield 2.8% -       3.1% 2.9% -       3.3% 3.2% -       3.4% Weighted average volatility factor 24.9% - 25.9% 24.5% - 24.9% 25.9% - 30.4% Weighted average       expected life (in years) 5.2 - 5.3 5.1 - 5.2 5.0 - 5.1 Fair value $8.46 $7.59 $7.05 The weighted average fair values of shares granted were as follows: Year ended June       30, 2012 Performance-based restricted       stock $ 44.33 Time-based restricted       stock $ 54.40 B. Pension Plans.
The Company has a defined benefit cash balance pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees, under which employees are credited with a percentage of base pay plus interest. The plan interest credit rate varies from year-to-year based on the ten-year U.S. Treasury rate. Employees are fully vested upon completion of three years of service. The Company's policy is to make contributions within the range determined by generally accepted actuarial principles. In addition, the Company has various retirement plans for its non-U.S. employees and maintains a Supplemental Officers Retirement Plan (SORP). The SORP is a defined benefit plan pursuant to which the Company pays supplemental pension benefits to certain key officers upon retirement based upon the officers years of service and compensation.
A June 30 measurement date was used in determining the Companys benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets.
The Company is required to (a) recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plans net overfunded status or a liability for a plans net underfunded status, (b) measure a plans assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employers fiscal year, and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit plan in the year in which the changes occur in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
68 The Companys pension plans funded status as of June 30, 2012 and 2011 is as follows: June 30, 2012 2011 Change in plan       assets: Fair       value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 1,313.3 $ 981.7 Actual return on       plan assets 106.6 200.0 Employer contributions 91.6 158.1 Currency translation       adjustments (4.6 ) 8.1 Benefits paid (37.4 ) (34.6 ) Fair value of plan assets       at end of year $ 1,469.5 $ 1,313.3 Change in benefit       obligation: Benefit       obligation at beginning of year $ 1,178.8 $ 1,087.9 Service     cost 57.2 52.5 Interest cost 62.1 56.6 Actuarial (gains)/losses 159.4 (5.4 ) Currency translation adjustments (10.8 ) 14.5 Benefits     paid (37.4 ) (34.6 ) Acquisitions 2.8 7.3 Projected benefit       obligation at end of year $ 1,412.1 $ 1,178.8 Funded status - plan       assets less benefit obligations $ 57.4 $ 134.5 The amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2012 and 2011 consisted of: June 30, 2012 2011 Noncurrent assets $ 170.3 $ 231.5 Current liabilities (4.3 ) (4.5 ) Noncurrent       liabilities (108.6 ) (92.5 ) Net amount recognized $ 57.4 $ 134.5 The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $1,399.9 million and $1,167.4 million at June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
The Companys pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of June 30, 2012 and 2011 had the following projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets: June 30, 2012 2011 Projected benefit       obligation $ 171.5 $ 150.7 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 161.8 $ 143.2 Fair value of plan       assets $ 60.8 $ 55.6 69 The components of net pension costs were as follows: Years ended June 30, 2012 2011 2010 Service cost - benefits       earned during the       period $ 57.2 $ 52.5 $ 47.6 Interest cost on projected benefits 62.1 56.6 59.1 Expected return on plan       assets (97.6 ) (88.5 ) (76.5 ) Amortization of losses 15.0 20.1 4.5 $ 36.7 $ 40.7 $ 34.7 The net actuarial loss, prior service cost and transition obligation for the defined benefit pension plans that are included in accumulated other comprehensive income that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost are $411.0 million, $6.2 million, and $0.7 million, respectively, at June 30, 2012. The estimated net actuarial loss, prior service cost, and transition obligation for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost over the next fiscal year are $29.3 million, $1.4 million, and $0.2 million, respectively, at June 30, 2012.
Assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of benefit obligations were: Years ended June 30, 2012 2011 Discount rate 3.90% 5.40% Increase in compensation levels 4.00% 4.00% Assumptions used to determine the net pension expense generally were: Years ended June 30, 2012 2011 2010 Discount rate 5.40 % 5.25 % 6.80 % Expected long-term rate of return on assets 7.25 % 7.25 % 7.25 % Increase in compensation levels 4.00 % 5.50 % 5.50 % The discount rate is based upon published rates for high-quality fixed-income investments that produce cash flows that approximate the timing and amount of expected future benefit payments.
The expected long-term rate of return on assets is determined based on historical and expected future rates of return on plan assets considering the target asset mix and the long-term investment strategy.
Plan Assets The Companys pension plans asset allocations at June 30, 2012 and 2011 by asset category were as follows: 2012 2011 United States Fixed Income       Securities 41 % 38 % United States Equity Securities 41 % 41 % International       Securities 18 % 21 % Total 100 % 100 % The Companys pension plans asset investment strategy is designed to ensure prudent management of assets, consistent with long-term return objectives and the prompt fulfillment of all pension plan obligations. The investment strategy and asset mix were developed in coordination with an asset liability study conducted by external consultants to maximize the funded ratio with the least amount of volatility.
70 The pension plans assets are currently invested in various asset classes with differing expected rates of return, correlations and volatilities, including large capitalization and small capitalization U.S. equities, international equities, U.S. fixed income securities and cash.
The target asset allocation ranges are generally as follows: United States Fixed Income     Securities 35%  45% United States Equity Securities 37%  50% International Equity Securities 12%  20% The pension plans fixed income portfolio is designed to match the duration and liquidity characteristics of the pension plans liabilities. In addition, the pension plans invest only in investment-grade debt securities to ensure preservation of capital. The pension plans equity portfolios are subject to diversification guidelines to reduce the impact of losses in single investments. Investment managers are prohibited from buying or selling commodities and from the short selling of securities.
None of the pension plans assets are directly invested in the Companys stock, although the pension plans may hold a minimal amount of Company stock to the extent of the Companys participation in the S&P 500 Index.
Plan investments included in Level 1 are valued using closing prices for identical instruments that are traded on active exchanges. Plan investments included in Level 2 are valued utilizing inputs obtained from an independent pricing service, which are reviewed by the Company for reasonableness. To determine the fair value of our Level 2 plan assets, a variety of inputs are utilized, including benchmark yields, reported trades, non-binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, new issue data, and monthly payment information. The Plan has no Level 3 investments at June 30, 2012.
The following table presents the investments of the pension plans measured at fair value at June 30, 2012: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Comingled trusts $ - $ 583.5 $ - $ 583.5 U.S. Government securities - 272.5 - 272.5 Mutual funds 269.6 - - 269.6 Corporate and municipal bonds - 272.8 - 272.8 Mortgage-backed security bonds - 13.9 - 13.9 Total pension assets $ 269.6 $ 1,142.7 $ - $ 1,412.3 In addition to the investments in the above table, the pension plans also held cash and cash equivalents of $57.2 million as of June 30, 2012.
71 The following table presents the investments of the pension plans measured at fair value at June 30, 2011: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Comingled trusts $ - $ 529.7 $ - $ 529.7 U.S. Government securities - 207.4 - 207.4 Mutual funds 283.4 - - 283.4 Corporate and municipal bonds - 237.7 - 237.7 Mortgage-backed security       bonds - 33.1 - 33.1 Total pension assets $ 283.4 $ 1,007.9 $ - $ 1,291.3 In addition to the investments in the above table, the pension plans also held cash and cash equivalents of $22.0 million as of June 30, 2011.
Contributions During fiscal 2012, the Company contributed $91.6 million to the pension plans. In July 2012, the Company contributed $125.0 million to the pension plans and expects to contribute an additional $8.3 million to the pension plans during its fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 (fiscal 2013).
Estimated Future Benefit Payments The benefits expected to be paid in each year from fiscal 2013 to 2017 are $48.2 million, $52.8 million, $60.4 million, $67.4 million and $77.4 million, respectively. The aggregate benefits expected to be paid in the five fiscal years from 2018 to 2022 are $525.7 million. The expected benefits to be paid are based on the same assumptions used to measure the Companys pension plans benefit obligations at June 30, 2012 and includes estimated future employee service.
C. Retirement and Savings Plan.
The Company has a 401(k) retirement and savings plan, which allows eligible employees to contribute up to 35% of their compensation annually and allows highly compensated employees to contribute up to 10% of their compensation annually. The Company matches a portion of employee contributions, which amounted to approximately $65.9 million, $57.5 million, and $55.8 million for the calendar years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

There are $52.1 million and $62.3 million of long-term deferred tax assets included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. There are $79.0 million, and $97.9 million of current deferred tax liabilities included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in an aggregate amount of approximately $932.7 million as of June 30, 2012, as the Company considers such earnings to be permanently reinvested outside of the United States. The additional U.S. income tax that would arise on repatriation of the remaining undistributed earnings could be offset, in part, by foreign tax credits on such repatriation. However, it is impractical to estimate the amount of net income tax that might be payable.
The Company has estimated foreign net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $129.0 million as of June 30, 2012, of which $63.4 million expires through 2032 and $65.6 million has an indefinite utilization period. As of June 30, 2012, the Company has approximately $113.6 million of federal net operating loss carry-forwards from acquired companies. The net operating loss has an annual utilization limitation pursuant to section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and expires through 2031.
The Company has state net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $215.5 million as of June 30, 2012, which expire through 2031.
The Company has recorded valuation allowances of $54.7 million and $62.7 million at June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, to reflect the estimated amount of domestic and foreign deferred tax assets that may not be realized.
74 Income tax payments were approximately $660.3 million, $628.7 million, and $693.4 million for fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
As of June 30, 2012, 2011, and 2010 the Companys liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $84.7 million, $105.7 million, and $107.2 million respectively. The amount that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate is $43.7 million, $56.3 million, and $52.8 million, respectively. The remainder, if recognized, would principally affect deferred taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 Unrecognized tax benefits       at beginning of the year $ 105.7 $ 107.2 $ 92.8 Additions for tax positions 8.0 9.7 13.3 Reductions for tax       positions (0.8 ) (2.4 ) (2.1 ) Additions for tax positions of prior       periods 13.0 17.3 29.6 Reductions for tax       positions of prior periods (21.6 ) (23.3 ) (1.0 ) Settlement with tax authorities (4.2 ) (4.5 ) (5.0 ) Expiration of the statute       of limitations (9.8 ) (0.4 ) (20.3 ) Impact of foreign exchange rate       fluctuations (5.6 ) 2.1 (0.1 ) Unrecognized tax benefits       at end of year $ 84.7 $ 105.7 $ 107.2 Interest expense and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions have been recorded in the provision for income taxes on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012, 2011, and 2010, the Company recorded interest expense of $1.2 million, $1.7 million, and $4.0 million, respectively. Penalties incurred during fiscal years ended June 30, 2012, 2011, and 2010 were not material. At June 30, 2012, the Company had accrued interest of $14.4 million recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $1.6 million was recorded within income taxes payable, and the remainder was recorded within other liabilities. At June 30, 2011, the Company had accrued interest of $15.4 million recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $0.4 million was recorded within income taxes payable, and the remainder was recorded within other liabilities. At June 30, 2012, the Company had accrued penalties of $2.1 million recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $0.7 million was recorded within income taxes payable, and the remainder was recorded within other liabilities. At June 30, 2011, the Company had accrued penalties of $3.4 million recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $0.1 million was recorded within income taxes payable, and the remainder was recorded within other liabilities.
The Company is routinely examined by the IRS and tax authorities in foreign countries in which it conducts business, as well as tax authorities in states in which it has significant business operations. The tax years currently under examination vary by jurisdiction. Examinations in progress in which the Company has significant business operations are as follows: Taxing Jurisdiction Fiscal Years under Examination U.S. (IRS) 2011 - 2012 California 2006 - 2008 Illinois 2004 - 2005 New       Jersey 2002 - 2008 France 2009 -   2011 The Company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments resulting from examinations in each of the jurisdictions. The resolution of tax matters is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although a resolution could have a material impact on the Companys Statements of Consolidated Earnings for a particular future period and on the Companys effective tax rate.
75 If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. Based on current estimates, settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to $10.0 million in the next twelve months. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
In fiscal 2012, the Company reached agreements with the IRS regarding all outstanding tax audit issues in dispute for the tax years ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2010, which did not have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
In January 2010, the Company reached an agreement with the IRS regarding all outstanding tax audit issues in dispute for the tax years ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2008, which did not have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
NOTE 15. CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company has obligations under various facilities and equipment leases and software license agreements. Total expense under these agreements was approximately $252.6 million, $159.2 million, and $175.4 million in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, with minimum commitments at June 30, 2012 as follows: Years ending June       30, 2013 $ 173.7 2014 127.1 2015 90.8 2016 46.8 2017 23.6 Thereafter 26.6 $ 488.6 In addition to fixed rentals, certain leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices.
As of June 30, 2012, the Company has purchase commitments of approximately $797.9 million relating to software and equipment purchases and maintenance contracts, of which $350.5 million relates to the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, $143.8 million relates to the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014 and the remaining $303.6 million relates to fiscal years ending June 30, 2015 through fiscal 2017.
On July 18, 2011, athenahealth, Inc. filed a complaint against ADP AdvancedMD, Inc. (ADP AdvancedMD), a subsidiary of the Company. athenahealth, Inc. alleged that ADP AdvancedMDs activities in providing medical practice management and billing and revenue management software and associated services to physicians and medical practice managers infringe two of athenahealth, Inc.s patents. On May 16, 2012, athenahealth, Inc. and the Company entered into a joint stipulation to dismiss without prejudice their claims and counterclaims related to one of the two patents. athenahealth, Inc. seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, and costs in connection with its claim related to the other patent. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to this claim, and is continuing to vigorously defend itself against the allegations.
In June 2011, the Company received a Commissioners Charge from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging that the Company has violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by refusing to recruit, hire, transfer and promote certain persons on the basis of their race, in the State of Illinois from at least the period of January 1, 2007 to the present. The Company continues to investigate the allegations set forth in the Commissioners Charge and is cooperating with the EEOCs investigation.
76 The Company is subject to various claims and litigation in the normal course of business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, the Company records a liability in the amount of its best estimate for the ultimate loss. At this time the Company is unable to estimate any reasonably possible loss, or range of reasonably possible loss, with respect to the matters described above. This is primarily because these matters are still in early stages and involve complex issues subject to inherent uncertainty. There can be no assurance that these matters will be resolved in a manner that is not adverse to the Company.
It is not the Companys business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. However, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company uses derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. In the normal course of business, the Company also enters into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Companys services and products. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.
NOTE 16. ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Comprehensive income is a measure of income that includes both net earnings and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) results from items deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in stockholders equity. Other comprehensive income (loss) was $(136.9) million, $157.6 million, and $53.5 million in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The accumulated balances reported in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for each component of other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows: June 30, 2012 2011 2010 Currency translation       adjustments $ 42.0 $ 183.1 $ 16.4 Unrealized net gain on       available-for-sale securities, net of tax 461.3 369.8 457.8 Pension liability       adjustment, net of tax (273.1 ) (185.8 ) (264.7 ) Accumulated other comprehensive     income $ 230.2 $ 367.1 $ 209.5 NOTE 17. FINANCIAL DATA BY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA Based upon similar economic characteristics and operational characteristics, the Companys strategic business units have been aggregated into the following three reportable segments: Employer Services, PEO Services, and Dealer Services. The primary components of the Other segment are the results of operations of ADP Indemnity, non-recurring gains and losses, miscellaneous processing services, such as customer financing transactions, and certain expenses that have not been charged to the reportable segments, such as stock-based compensation expense. Certain revenues and expenses are charged to the reportable segments at a standard rate for management reasons. Other costs are recorded based on management responsibility. The fiscal 2011 and 2010 reportable segments revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes have been adjusted to reflect updated fiscal 2012 budgeted foreign exchange rates. In addition, there is a reconciling item for the difference between actual interest income earned on invested funds held for clients and interest credited to Employer Services and PEO Services at a standard rate of 4.5%. The reportable segments results also include an internal cost of capital charge related to the funding of acquisitions and other investments. All of these adjustments/charges are reconciling items to our reportable segments revenues and/or earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and results in the elimination of these adjustments/charges in consolidation. Reportable segments assets from continuing operations include funds held for clients, but exclude corporate cash, corporate marketable securities and goodwill.

Managements Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company carried out an evaluation (the evaluation), under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2012 in ensuring that (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (ii) such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms.
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting It is the responsibility of Automatic Data Processing, Inc.s (ADP) management to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to ADPs management and board of directors regarding the preparation of reliable financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
ADPs internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of ADP; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of ADP are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of ADP; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of ADPs assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements of ADP.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Management has performed an assessment of the effectiveness of ADPs internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2012 based upon criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management determined that ADPs internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2012.
80 Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of ADP included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the operating effectiveness of ADPs internal control over financial reporting. The Deloitte & Touche LLP attestation report is set forth below.
/s/Carlos A. Rodriguez Carlos A. Rodriguez President and Chief Executive       Officer /s/Christopher R. Reidy Christopher R. Reidy Chief Financial   Officer Roseland, New Jersey August 20, 2012 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in ADPs internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, ADPs internal control over financial reporting.
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Automatic Data Processing, Inc.
Roseland, New Jersey We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
81 A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended June 30, 2012 of the Company and our report dated August 20, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule.
