Business CORPORATE BACKGROUND General ADP  was founded in 1949 on an innovative idea to help business owners focus on core business activities by relieving them from certain administrative tasks such as payroll.  Automatic Data Processing, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware in June 1961 and completed its initial public offering in September 1961.  Today we are one of the world's leading providers of human capital management solutions to employers, as well as integrated computing solutions to vehicle dealers around the world.  We offer solutions to businesses of all sizes, whether they have simple or complex needs, and serve approximately 637,000 clients in more than 125 countries.  Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol ADP.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW ADP's Mission and Strategy For 65 years, ADPs mission has been to help organizations unlock their business potential with our insightful solutions. Our commitment to service excellence lies at the core of our relationship with each of our clients, whether a small, midsized or large organization, in one or multiple countries.  We innovate to deliver new products and services that anticipate client needs in all of our markets.  We help businesses focus on and optimize the most important investment they make - their investment in their people.  From recruitment to talent management to retirement, our unique combination of expertise and technology offers insights that help our clients leverage human capital management (HCM) to drive better business results.  Our future success also depends on our recruiting, hiring, developing and retaining highly qualified, motivated and diverse talent.  Predicated on these priorities, our business strategy is based upon the following three strategic pillars, which are designed to position ADP as the global market leader in HCM services:  grow our integrated suite of cloud-based HCM, benefits, and payroll solutions to serve the U.S. market;  invest to grow and scale our HR Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) solutions by leveraging our platforms and processes; and  leverage our global presence to offer clients HCM, benefits, and payroll solutions where they do business.
Reportable Segments ADP's three reportable business segments are: Employer Services; Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services; and Dealer Services.  For financial data by segment and by geographic area, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
On April 10, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a plan to separate our Dealer Services business into an independent publicly traded company through a tax-free spin-off of 100% of our Dealer Services business to ADP shareholders. The spin-off is subject to required regulatory approvals and reviews and we expect to complete the separation by October 2014.  For more information on the spin-off of our Dealer Services business, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

MARKETS AND MARKETING METHODS Employer Services offers its products and services in the United States and other countries.  In fiscal 2014 , 79% of Employer Services' revenues were from the United States, 14% were from Europe, 4% were from Canada, and 3% were from South America, Australia, and Asia.  ADP GlobalView is available to the largest multinational clients in 41 different countries and ADP Streamline is available to clients with small and midsized operations in 100 different countries.  In addition, Employer Services offers in-country payroll and human resources outsourcing solutions to both small and large clients in 33 countries.  In Canada, we are a leading provider of payroll processing (including full departmental outsourcing) and human resource administration services.  Within Europe, we have business operations supporting our in-country solutions in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.  We also offer payroll outsourcing services as well as HCM solutions in South America (in Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Peru), China, India, and Australia.  We offer wage and tax collection and remittance services in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and France.  PEO Services offers services exclusively in the United States.
Dealer Services primarily serves automobile dealerships, which in turn may be dependent on a relatively small number of automobile manufacturers, but also serves truck, powersports (i.e., motorcycle, marine, and RV) and heavy equipment dealers, auto repair shops, used car lots, state departments of motor vehicles, vehicle manufacturers, and vehicle distributors.  Dealer Services has offerings in 100 countries across North America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Asia Pacific region.
We market our products and services primarily through our direct sales force.  Employer Services also markets its solutions through indirect sales channels, such as marketing relationships with banks and accountants, among others.  In addition, Dealer Services uses distributors to sell, implement and support its solutions in select emerging markets.  None of ADP's major business groups has a single homogenous client base or market.  While concentrations of clients exist in specific industries, no one client or industry group is material to ADP's overall revenues.  ADP enjoys a leadership position in each of its major service offerings and does not believe any major service or major business unit of ADP is subject to unique market risk.
COMPETITION The industries in which ADP operates are highly competitive. ADP knows of no reliable statistics by which it can determine the number of its competitors, but it believes that it is one of the largest providers of business outsourcing solutions in the world. Employer Services and PEO Services compete with other independent business outsourcing companies, companies providing enterprise resource planning services, software companies and financial institutions. In addition, another competitive factor in the industries in which Employer Services and PEO Services operate is a company's use of third party software applications or a captive in-house function, whereby a company installs and operates its own business processing systems.  Dealer Services' competitors include full service DMS providers, such as The Reynolds & Reynolds Company (Dealer Services' largest DMS competitor in the United States and Canada), Dealertrack Technologies, Inc., and companies providing applications and services that compete with Dealer Services' non-DMS applications and services, such as Auto Trader Group, Inc. and Dealer.com, Inc.
8 INDUSTRY REGULATION Our business is subject to a wide range of complex laws and regulations. In addition, many of our products and services are designed to assist clients with their compliance with certain laws and regulations to which they are subject. We have developed and continue to enhance compliance programs and policies to monitor and address the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our products, services, and operations, including dedicated compliance personnel and training programs.
As one of the world's largest providers of business outsourcing solutions, our systems contain a significant amount of both sensitive client data and data related to employees of our clients.  We are, therefore, subject to compliance obligations under both federal and state privacy and data security-related laws, including, with respect to some of our businesses such as our COBRA, flexible spending account and insurance services businesses, ADP AdvancedMD and ADP TotalSource, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.  We are also subject to federal and state security breach notification laws with respect to both our own employee data and client employee data.  Additionally, the changing nature of privacy laws in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients.
As part of our payroll and payroll tax management services, we move client funds to taxing authorities and our clients' employees via electronic transfer, direct deposit, and ADPCheck. Certain elements of our U.S. money transmission activities, including our electronic payment and prepaid access (payroll pay card) offerings, are subject to certain licensing requirements. Elements of our money transmission activities outside of the United States are subject to similar laws and requirements in the countries in which we offer such services. In addition, our U.S. prepaid access (payroll card) offering is subject to the anti-money laundering and reporting provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act.  Our employee screening and selection services business offers background checking services that are subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Our PEO business (ADP TotalSource) is subject to various state licensing requirements.  In addition, because ADP TotalSource is a co-employer with respect to its clients' worksite employees, we may assume certain obligations and responsibilities of an employer under federal and state tax, insurance and employment laws.
In addition, many of our businesses offer products and services that assist our clients in complying with certain laws and regulations to which they are subject; although the laws and regulations apply to our clients and not to ADP, changes in such laws or regulations may affect our operations, products and services.  For example, our HCM solutions help clients manage their compliance with certain requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.   Our COBRA administration services and flexible spending account services are designed to comply with relevant federal guidelines relating to, respectively, employers' benefits continuation obligations and the requirements of Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Similarly, our Tax Credits Services business, which helps clients take advantage of tax credit opportunities as they hire new employees, is based on federal, state, or local tax laws and regulations allowing for tax credits.
The foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing and impacting our business.  See the discussion contained in the "Risk Factors" section in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding changes in laws and regulations that may decrease our revenues and earnings.
CLIENTS AND CLIENT CONTRACTS ADP provides its services to approximately 637,000 clients. In fiscal 2014 , no single client or group of affiliated clients accounted for revenues in excess of 2% of annual consolidated revenues.
ADP is continuously in the process of performing implementation services for new clients. Depending on the service agreement and/or the size of the client, the installation or conversion period for new clients could vary from a short period of time for a small Employer Services client (as little as 24 hours) to a longer period for a large Employer Services client or a Dealer Services client with multiple deliverables (generally six to twelve months), and in some cases may exceed two years for a large GlobalView client or other large, complicated implementation.   Although we monitor sales that have not yet been billed or installed, we do not view this metric as material in light of the recurring nature of our business. This is not a reported number, but it is used by management as a planning tool relating to resources needed to install services, and a means of assessing our performance against the installation timing expectations of our clients.
Our business is typically characterized by long-term client relationships that result in recurring revenue. Our services are provided under written price quotations or service agreements having varying terms and conditions. No one price quotation or service agreement is material to ADP. ADP's client retention is estimated at approximately 12 years in Employer Services, approximately 7 years in PEO Services, and approximately 12 years in Dealer Services, and has not varied significantly from period to period.
9 SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , ADP invested approximately $834 million, $757 million, and $699 million, respectively, from continuing operations, in systems development and programming, migration to new computing technologies and the development of new products and maintenance of our existing technologies, including purchases of new software and software licenses.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ADP continually upgrades, enhances, and expands its existing solutions and services. Generally, no new solution or service has a significant effect on ADP's revenues or negatively impacts its existing solutions and services, and ADP's solutions and services have significant remaining life cycles.
LICENSES ADP is the licensee under a number of agreements for computer programs and databases. ADP's business is not dependent upon a single license or group of licenses. Third-party licenses, patents, trademarks, and franchises are not material to ADP's business as a whole.
NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES ADP employed approximately 61,000 persons as of June30, 2014 .
10 Item 1A. Risk Factors Our businesses routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate. Risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business. The following information should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion includes a number of forward-looking statements. You should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in the first paragraph under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time, and any of these risks may have a material effect on our business.
Changes in laws and regulations may decrease our revenues and earnings Our business is subject to a wide range of complex laws and regulations.  Changes in laws or governmental regulations, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations by a regulatory authority, may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business.  For example, a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities or client employees. Changes in taxation requirements in the United States or in other countries could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income.  Changes in laws that govern the co-employment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our PEO business. Health care reform under the Affordable Care Act, as amended, related state laws, and the regulations adopted or to be adopted thereunder, have the potential to impact substantially the way that employers provide health insurance to employees and the health insurance market for the small and midsized businesses that comprise ADP TotalSource's clients and prospects. We are unable to determine the ultimate impact that health care reform will have on our PEO business and our ability to attract and retain PEO clients. Amendments to money transmitter statutes have required us to receive licenses in some jurisdictions, and the adoption of new money transmitter statutes in other jurisdictions, as well as changes in the interpretation of existing statutes, in the future could require additional registration or licensing, as well as possible changes to the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our money movement business or our client funds investment strategy.
Our businesses host, collect, use and store personal information about our clients and employees of our clients, and a security or privacy breach may damage or disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses A number of our businesses host, collect, use and store large amounts of personal information about our clients and employees of our clients, including payroll information, healthcare information, personal and business financial data, social security numbers, bank account numbers, tax information and other sensitive personal and business information.    In addition, we collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business.  We are focused on ensuring our operating environments safeguard and protect personal and business information, and although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the threats that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us, the impact of a breach could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We are also subject to various laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use and security of personal and business information.   The future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules or regulations could have an adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses.  In addition, the possession and use of personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to laws that may require notification to clients or employees of a privacy breach.
Globally, attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication.  Although this is a global problem, it may affect our businesses more than other businesses because malevolent third parties may focus on the amount and type of personal and business information that our businesses host, collect, use and store.  Any cyber attack, unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption, denial of service, corruption of data, or theft of non-public or other sensitive information, or similar act by a malevolent party could create financial liability, regulatory sanction, or a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients or cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider.  As these threats continue to evolve, we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.  In addition, while our operating environment is designed to safeguard and protect personal and business information, we do not have the ability to 11 monitor the implementation of similar safeguards by our clients, vendors or their respective employees, and, in any event, third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures.
Our systems may be subject to disruptions that could adversely affect our business and reputation Many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of complicated transactions. We rely heavily on our payroll, financial, accounting, and other data processing systems. If any of these systems fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention, or damage to our reputation. We have disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events including natural disasters, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures, or similar events. Despite our preparations, our plans may not be successful in preventing the loss of client data, service interruptions, disruptions to our operations, or damage to our important facilities.
If we fail to adapt our technology to meet client needs and preferences, the demand for our services may diminish Our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences. In order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands, we continually upgrade, enhance, and expand our existing solutions and services. If we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges, the demand for our services may diminish.
Political and economic factors may adversely affect our business and financial results Trade, monetary and fiscal policies, and political and economic conditions may substantially change, and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility. When there is a slowdown in the economy, employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses. Clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services or renegotiating their contracts with us. In addition, a reduction in availability of financing during such conditions, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our access to short-term debt markets to meet liquidity needs required by our Employer Services business.
We invest our client funds in liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, money market securities, and other cash equivalents. Nevertheless, our client fund assets are subject to general market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks. These risks may be exacerbated, individually or in unison, during periods of unusual financial market volatility.
We are dependent upon various large banks to execute Automated Clearing House and wire transfers as part of our client payroll and tax services. While we have contingency plans in place for bank failures, a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll and tax services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity.
We derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income outside of the United States and, as a result, we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability The major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have given us very strong long-term debt and the highest commercial paper ratings. Failure to maintain high credit ratings on long-term and short-term debt could increase our cost of borrowing, reduce our ability to obtain intra-day borrowing required by our Employer Services business, and ultimately reduce our client interest revenue.
Our proposed spin-off of our Dealer Services business is subject to inherent risks The proposed spin-off of our Dealer Services business is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties including, among others: risks that the spin-off will not be consummated; increased demands on our management team to accomplish the spin-off; and significant transaction costs and risks from changes in the results of operations of our reportable segments.
We may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel Our ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our clients. Competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and, if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel, results of our operations may suffer.

12 Item 2. Properties ADP owns 12 of its processing/print centers, and 24 other operational offices, sales offices, and its corporate headquarters in Roseland, New Jersey, which aggregate approximately 3,705,397 square feet. None of ADP's owned facilities is subject to any material encumbrances. ADP leases space for some of its processing centers, other operational offices, and sales offices. All of these leases, which aggregate approximately 6,062,311 square feet in North America, Europe, South America, Asia, Australia and Africa, expire at various times up to the year 2024. ADP believes its facilities are currently adequate for their intended purposes and are adequately maintained.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings In the normal course of business, ADP is subject to various claims and litigation. While the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable, ADP believes that it has valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against it and that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following table reconciles results within our Selected Financial Data to adjusted results that exclude incremental costs incurred during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 ("fiscal 2014") that are directly attributable to the planned separation of our Dealer Services business, a goodwill impairment charge related to our ADP AdvancedMD business for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 ("fiscal 2013"), a gain on the sale of assets related to rights and obligations to resell a third-party expense management platform for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 ("fiscal 2012"), and certain favorable tax items for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010.  We use certain adjusted results, among other measures, to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods.  We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by us and improves our ability to understand our operating performance.  Since adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations, and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), they should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, net earnings from continuing operations, and diluted EPS from continuing operations, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

17 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW On April 10, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a plan to separate our Dealer Services business into an independent publicly traded company through a tax-free spin-off of 100% of Dealer Services to ADP shareholders.  We expect to receive at least $700 million in connection with the spin-off, which we plan to return to our shareholders after the spin-off through share repurchases, depending upon market conditions.  Following the spin-off, we intend to increase the dividend annually, subject to Board of Director approval, keeping intact our 39-year track record of consecutive dividend increases.  However, we expect to grow the dividend at a slower rate than earnings to allow us to return to our pre-separation target dividend payout ratio of 55% to 60% in about two years.  We believe that the separation of the Dealer Services business will allow both companies to focus on their respective businesses, industries, and strategic opportunities and we will further direct our attention and resources to our mission and three strategic pillars discussed below.  We expect to complete the separation by October 2014.
ADP's mission is to help organizations unlock their business potential with our insightful solutions.  We seek to embrace new technology and innovation to deliver market leading products and services that meet the needs of our clients across all of our markets.  Our commitment to service excellence lies at the core of our relationship with each of our clients, whether a small, midsized or large organization in one or multiple countries.  Our business strategy is based on strategic pillars, which are predicated on our ability to drive innovation and service excellence, and attract, build, and retain the right talent to position ADP as the global market leader in human capital management (HCM) services.  Our strategic pillars are to:  grow our integrated suite of cloud-based HCM, benefits, and payroll solutions to serve the U.S. market;  invest to grow and scale our HR Business Process Outsourcing solutions by leveraging our platforms and processes; and  leverage our global presence to offer clients HCM, benefits, and payroll solutions where they do business.
Our results during fiscal 2014 continue to reflect the strength of our underlying business model, including the diversity of our client base and products.  Our focus on product innovation and improvements in salesforce productivity led to growth in new business bookings.  We are pleased with the performance of our business segments, which have continued to drive good revenue growth and pretax margin expansion. Revenue retention improved across our business segments and we continue to benefit from the strength of our pays per control metric, which represents the number of employees on our clients' payrolls as measured on a same-store-sales basis utilizing a representative subset of payrolls ranging from small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions.  During fiscal 2014, we were impacted by the decline in high-margin client interest revenues as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by an increase in our average client funds balance. We expect this high-margin client interest revenue to increase in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015, but at a slower rate than our underlying processing revenue.
Consolidated revenues in fiscal 2014 increased 8% , to $12,206.5 million , as compared to fiscal 2013 .  Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 10% , to $2,274.6 million , as compared to fiscal 2013 and net earnings from continuing operations increased 11% , to $1,502.6 million , as compared to fiscal 2013 .  Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 11% to $3.11 in fiscal 2014 , as compared to $2.79 in fiscal 2013 .
Our fiscal 2014 results include $14.9 million of incremental costs directly attributable to our planned separation of our Dealer Service business and our fiscal 2013 results include a $42.7 million non tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge related to our ADP AdvancedMD business.  Excluding these items, our earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increase d 8% , to $2,289.5 million , as compared to $2,118.8 million for fiscal 2013 , and net earnings from continuing operations increase d 8% , to $1,517.5 million , compared to $1,400.8 million for fiscal 2013 .  Our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increase d 9% , to $3.14 for fiscal 2014 from $2.88 , as adjusted, for fiscal 2013 , due to increased adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and fewer shares outstanding.
Our business segment results were solid with Employer Services' revenues increasing 8% to $8,535.2 million and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increasing 14% to $2,517.8 million , PEO Services' revenues increasing 15% to $2,270.9 million and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increasing 17% to $234.3 million , and Dealer Services' revenues increasing 7% to $1,951.4 million and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increasing 14% to $428.1 million in fiscal 2014 .  Employer Services' and PEO Services' new business bookings, which represent annualized recurring revenues anticipated from sales orders to new and existing clients, grew 7% worldwide, to over $1.4 billion in fiscal 2014 . Dealer Services' new business bookings showed strength as we continued to experience the effects of a stronger automotive industry and increased penetration of applications within our base.  Our key business metrics continue to reflect the core strength of our business model, with our Employer Services' worldwide client revenue retention rate increasing to an all-time high of 91.4% and our pays per control metric increased 2.8% for the twelve months ended June30, 2014 from the twelve months ended June 30, 2013.
18 Interest on funds held for clients decreased approximately 11% , or $47.2 million , to $373.7 million from $420.9 million in fiscal 2013 .  The decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 1.8% in fiscal 2014 , as compared to 2.2% in fiscal 2013 , partially offset by growth in average client funds balance of 8% resulting from the continued strength and growth of our Employer Services segment.
We invest our funds held for clients in accordance with ADP's prudent and conservative investment guidelines, where the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification are the foremost objectives of our investment strategy. The portfolio is predominantly invested in AAA/AA rated fixed-income securities. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).This investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations.
Our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at June30, 2014 , with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $4.1 billion , of which $2.2 billion related to outstanding commercial paper borrowings.  These borrowings were a normal part of our client funds extended investment strategy.  Our net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,821.4 million in fiscal 2014 , as compared to $1,577.2 million in fiscal 2013 .  This increase in cash flows provided by operating activities from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 was due to higher net earnings in fiscal 2014 , favorable changes in timing differences on the net components of working capital, and lower pension contributions.  The increase in cash provided by investing activities of $2,391.7 million is due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations, partially offset by the timing of purchases and sales of corporate and client fund marketable securities.  The increase in cash used in financing activities of $2,509.2 million is primarily due to the timing of cash received from items such as proceeds from reverse repurchase agreements, proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper, and payments made related to client funds as compared to the prior year.
We have a strong business model with a high percentage of recurring revenues, excellent margins, the ability to generate consistent, healthy cash flows, strong client retention, and low capital expenditure requirements.  We continue to enhance value to our shareholders, and in fiscal 2014 returned excess cash of $883.1 million through dividends and $667.3 million through our share buyback program. In the last five fiscal years, we have reduced the Company's common stock outstanding by approximately 4% through share buybacks, net of the effect of common stock issued under employee stock-based compensation programs.

Other The primary components of the Other segment are the results of operations of ADP Indemnity, non-recurring gains and losses, miscellaneous processing services, such as customer financing transactions, and certain charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as stock-based compensation expense, the fiscal 2014 separation costs related to the planned separation of our Dealer Services business, and the fiscal 2013 goodwill impairment charge.
Stock-based compensation expense was $138.4 million , $96.4 million , and $94.1 million in fiscal 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively.
ADP Indemnity provides workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services worksite employees up to a $1 million per occurrence.  PEO Services has secured specific per occurrence and aggregate stop loss insurance from a wholly-owned and regulated insurance carrier of AIG that covers all losses 29 in excess of the $1 million per occurrence and also any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level in each policy year.  We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the PEO Services business.  Premiums are charged to PEO Services to cover the claims expected to be incurred by the PEO Services' worksite employees.  Changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are recognized by ADP Indemnity.  During fiscal 2014 , ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $142.4 million to enter into a reinsurance arrangement with ACE American Insurance Company to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for the fiscal 2014 policy year up to the $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services worksite employees.  ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $167.9 million in July 2014 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with ACE American Insurance Company to cover substantially all losses for the year ended fiscal 2015 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2014 reinsurance policy to cover losses up to the $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services worksite employees.

As a result of short-term commercial paper obligations outstanding as of June30, 2014 , we reclassified funds held for clients to short-term marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents, which did not impact our working capital before clients fund obligations at June 30, 2014.
In fiscal 2015, as a result of the planned separation of our Dealer Services business, we expect to receive a dividend of at least $700 million, which we plan to return to our shareholders after the spin-off through share repurchases, depending upon market conditions.
Additionally, in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect to monetize notes receivables related to our Dealer Services financing arrangements, which is expected to generate between $195 million and $205 million of cash.
Our principal sources of liquidity for operations are derived from cash generated through operations and through corporate cash and marketable securities on hand. We continued to generate positive cash flows from operations during fiscal 2014 , and we held approximately $4.1 billion of cash and marketable securities at June30, 2014 , which included $2.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents related to our commercial paper borrowings.We have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our U.S. short-term commercial paper program and our U.S. and Canadian short-term reverse repurchase agreements to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.  Included in our cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2014 is $0.8 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries.  Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries, if repatriated to the U.S., would generally be subject to foreign withholding and U.S. income taxes, adjusted for foreign tax credits.  Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.
Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows for the years ended 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , are summarized as follows: 30 Years ended June 30, $ Change 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,821.4 $ 1,577.2 $ 1,910.2 $ 244.2 $ (333.0 ) Investing activities 813.3 (1,578.4 ) 3,243.6 2,391.7 (4,822.0 ) Financing activities (2,358.2 ) 151.0 (4,953.9 ) (2,509.2 ) 5,104.9 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 8.0 1.2 (41.2 ) 6.8 42.4 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 284.5 $ 151.0 $ 158.7 $ 133.5 $ (7.7 ) Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,821.4 million for fiscal 2014 , as compared to $ 1,577.2 million for fiscal 2013 .The increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities was due to $110.1 million higher net earnings in  fiscal 2014 , a lower pension contribution of $50.6 million, and a favorable change in the remaining components of net working capital.  For the year ended June 30, 2014, Other operating activities include a $49.9 million use of funds and financing activities include a $49.9 million source of funds for excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.  For the year ended June 30, 2013, Other operating activities include a $16.2 million use of funds and financing activities include a $16.2 million source of funds for excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.
Net cash flows provided by investing activities were $ 813.3 million for fiscal 2014 , as compared to net cash flows used in investing activities of $ 1,578.4 million for fiscal 2013 .

Net cash flows used in financing activities were $ 2,358.2 million for fiscal 2014 as compared to net cash flows provided by financing activities of $ 151.0 million for fiscal 2013 .The net change in cash provided by financing activities is due to the net decrease in client funds obligations of $4,128.0 million as a result of the timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds and the timing of our borrowings and repayments of our reverse repurchase obligations, partially offset by the net increase in proceeds from commercial paper borrowings of $2,173.0 million .
We purchased approximately 9.0 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $75.06 during fiscal 2014 compared to purchases of 10.4 million shares at an average price per share of $61.89 during fiscal 2013 .From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs. The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.
Our U.S. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained through a short-term commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $7.25 billion in aggregate maturity value of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities.  In July 2014, we increased our U.S. short-term commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to $7.5 billion in aggregate maturity value.  Our commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poors and Prime-1 by Moodys.These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities.Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days.For fiscal 2014 and 2013 , our average borrowings were $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion , respectively, at weighted average interest rate of 0.1% and 0.2% , respectively.  The weighted average maturity of the Companys commercial paper during fiscal 2014 approximated two days . We have successfully borrowed through the use of our commercial paper program on an as needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.  At June30, 2014 , we had $2.2 billion of commercial paper outstanding, which was subsequently repaid on July1, 2014 .  At June30, 2013 , we had no outstanding obligations under our short-term commercial paper program.
Our U.S. and Canadian short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days.We have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet short-term funding 31 requirements related to client funds obligations.  At June30, 2014 , there were no outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements.  At June30, 2013 , we had $245.9 million of obligations outstanding related to reverse repurchase agreements, which were repaid on July2, 2013 .  For fiscal 2014 and 2013 , we had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of $361.7 million and $362.0 million , respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 0.5% and 0.7% , respectively.  In addition, we have $3.25 billion available to us on a committed basis under these reverse repurchase agreements.We believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the committed reverse repurchase agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $3.25 billion available to us under the committed reverse repurchase agreements.
We have a $2.25 billion , 364-day credit agreement with a group of lenders that matures in June 2015 .  In addition, we have a five-year $2.0 billion credit facility and a five-year $3.25 billion credit facility maturing in June 2018 and June 2019 , respectively, each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $ 500.0 million , subject to the availability of additional commitments.  The interest rate applicable to committed borrowings is tied to LIBOR, the effective federal funds rate, or the prime rate depending on the notification provided by the Company to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing.The Company is also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary.We had no borrowings through June30, 2014 under the credit agreements. We believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $7.5 billion available to us under the revolving credit agreements.
Our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of subprime mortgages, alternative-A mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or sub-prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, asset-backed commercial paper, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment grade fixed-income securities.  We own AAA rated senior tranches of fixed rate credit card, auto loan, rate reduction, and other asset-backed securities, secured predominately by prime collateral.All collateral on asset-backed securities is performing as expected.In addition, we own senior debt directly issued by Federal Home Loan Banks and Federal Farm Credit Banks.We do own mortgage-backed securities, which represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a group or pool of one or more residential mortgages.These securities are collateralized by the cash flows of 15-year and 30-year residential mortgages and are guaranteed by Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation as to the timely payment of principal and interest.Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).This investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations.
Capital expenditures for continuing operations in fiscal 2014 were $218.7 million , as compared to $174.8 million in fiscal 2013 and $146.2 million in fiscal 2012 .The capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 related to our data center and other facility improvements made to support our operations. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 to be between $250 million and $275 million.
The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2014 : (In millions) Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Unknown Total Debt Obligations (1) $ 2.3 $ 5.1 $ 6.9 $  $  $ 14.3 Operating Lease and Software License Obligations (2) $ 209.9 $ 235.2 $ 83.0 $ 32.6 $  $ 560.7 Purchase Obligations (3) $ 379.7 $ 268.4 $ 132.3 $  $  $ 780.4 Obligations related to Unrecognized Tax Benefits (4) $ 1.0 $  $  $  $ 55.7 $ 56.7 Other long-term liabilities reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets: Compensation and Benefits (5) $ 5.4 $ 191.6 $ 100.4 $ 265.0 $ 80.0 $ 642.4 Acquisition-related obligations (6) $ 0.3 $  $  $  $  $ 0.3 Total $ 598.6 $ 700.3 $ 322.6 $ 297.6 $ 135.7 $ 2,054.8 32 (1) These amounts represent the principal repayments of our debt and are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The estimated interest payments due by the corresponding period above are $0.5 million, $0.6 million, $0.1 million, and $0.0 million, respectively, which have been excluded.
(2) Included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases and software license agreements.  We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment, as well as the licensing of software.  The majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time.  Certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices.  Our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements.

We are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the period beyond the next 12 months in which cash payments related to unrecognized tax benefits are expected to be paid.
(5) Compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements. These amounts exclude the estimated contributions to our defined benefit plans, which are expected to be $9.5 million in fiscal 2015 .
(6) Acquisition-related obligations relate to deferred purchase consideration payments at future dates.  A liability is established at the time of the acquisition for these fixed payments.
In addition to the obligations quantified in the table above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services.  As of June30, 2014 , the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2015 , total $18,963.4 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

ADP Indemnity provides workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services worksite employees up to a $1 million per occurrence.  PEO Services has secured specific per occurrence and aggregate stop loss insurance from a wholly-owned and regulated insurance carrier of AIG that covers all losses in excess of the $1 million per occurrence and also any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level in certain policy years.  Should AIG and its wholly-owned insurance company be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations, ADP would also become responsible for satisfying these worksite employee workers' compensation obligations for these claims in excess of the $1 million per occurrence.  We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the PEO Services business.  Premiums are charged to PEO Services to cover the claims expected to be incurred by the PEO Services' worksite employees.  Changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are recognized by ADP Indemnity.  During fiscal 2014, ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $142.4 million to enter into a reinsurance agreement with ACE American Insurance Company to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for the fiscal 2014 policy year up to the $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employers' liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services worksite employees.  ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $167.9 million in July 2014 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with ACE American Insurance Company to cover substantially all losses for the fiscal 2015 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2014 reinsurance policy.  At June30, 2014 , ADP Indemnity's total assets were $378.4 million to satisfy the actuarially estimated unpaid losses of $318.8 million for the policy years since July 1, 2003.  ADP Indemnity paid claims of $45.3 million and $59.5 million, net of insurance recoveries, in fiscal 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
In the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. We do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and long-term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees).
33 Our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities.These assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury and/or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes.All of our short-term and long-term fixed-income securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
Our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. Consistent with those objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income.Client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents.At June30, 2014 , approximately 92% of the available-for-sale securities categorized as U.S. Treasury and direct obligations of U.S. government agencies were invested in senior, unsecured, non-callable debt directly issued by the Federal Home Loan Banks and Federal Farm Credit Banks.
We utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).As part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities.We minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such clients obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the clients funds in advance of the timing of payment of such clients obligation.As a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations.
There are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets.Such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations.However, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations.We also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $7.5 billion commercial paper program (rated A-1+ by Standard and Poors and Prime-1 (P1) by Moodys, the highest possible credit ratings), our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions ($ 3.25 billion of which is available on a committed basis), and available borrowings under our $7.5 billion committed revolving credit facilities.  The reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business.In addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below.
We have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments.The minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate and Canadian provincial bonds is BBB, for asset-backed securities is AAA, and for municipal bonds is A.The maximum maturity at time of purchase for BBB rated securities is 5 years, for single A rated securities is 7 years, and for AA rated and AAA rated securities is 10 years.  Time deposits and commercial paper must be rated A-1 and/or P-1.  Money market funds must be rated AAA/Aaa-mf.
34 Details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows: (Dollars in millions) Years ended June 30, 2014 2013 2012 Average investment balances at cost: Corporate investments $ 4,072.4 $ 4,200.3 $ 4,024.6 Funds held for clients 20,726.5 19,156.3 17,898.2 Total $ 24,798.9 $ 23,356.6 $ 21,922.8 Average interest rates earned exclusive of realized gains/(losses) on: Corporate investments 1.4 % 1.5 % 2.1 % Funds held for clients 1.8 % 2.2 % 2.8 % Total 1.7 % 2.1 % 2.6 % Realized gains on available-for-sale securities $ 20.4 $ 32.1 $ 32.1 Realized losses on available-for-sale securities (3.9 ) (3.5 ) (7.7 ) Net realized gains on available-for-sale securities $ 16.5 $ 28.6 $ 24.4 Impairment losses on available-for-sale securities $  $  $ (5.8 ) As of June 30: Net unrealized pre-tax gains on available-for-sale securities $ 324.4 $ 287.4 $ 710.5 Total available-for-sale securities at fair value $ 20,156.5 $ 18,838.7 $ 18,093.4 We are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested.Factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments.This mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes.The annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio decrease d from 2.1% for fiscal 2013 to 1.7% for fiscal 2014 .A hypothetical change in both short-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $10 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending June 30, 2015 .A hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $5 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending June 30, 2015 .
We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities.We limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily AAA and AA rated securities, as rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors, and for Canadian securities, Dominion Bond Rating Service. Approximately 82% of our available-for-sale securities held a AAA or AA rating at June30, 2014 .In addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than U.S. and Canadian government or government agency securities.
We operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.We may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes.
35 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.  ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue depicting the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  ASU 2014-09 will also result in enhanced revenue related disclosures.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  We have not yet determined the impact of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, "Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity."  ASU 2014-08 requires that a disposal representing a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entitys financial results or a business activity classified as held for sale should be reported as discontinued operations.  ASU 2014-08 also expands the disclosure requirements for discontinued operations and adds new disclosures for individually significant dispositions that do not qualify as discontinued operations.  ASU 2014-08 is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2014.  The impact of ASU 2014-08 is dependent upon the nature of dispositions, if any, after adoption.
In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.  ASU 2013-11 requires netting of unrecognized tax benefits against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carryforward that would apply in settlement of the uncertain tax position.  ASU 2013-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.  Retrospective adoption is permitted.  The adoption of ASU 2013-11 will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
In July 2013, we adopted ASU 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220):  Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. ASU 2013-02 requires entities to disclose the amount of income (loss) reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income to each respective line item on the income statement.  The guidance allows companies to elect whether to disclose the reclassification either on the face of the income statement or in the notes to the financial statements, including cross-referencing other disclosures which provide additional details about these amounts.  We have elected to disclose the reclassification in the notes to the financial statements with cross-references to other disclosures which provide additional details about the amounts.  The adoption of ASU 2013-02 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
Revenue Recognition .  Our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services ( e.g.
, Employer Services' and PEO Services' payroll processing fees) as well as investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds and other Employer Services' client-related funds.  PEO revenues are reported net of direct pass-through costs, which are costs billed and incurred for PEO Services' worksite employees, primarily consisting of payroll wages and payroll taxes.  Benefits, workers' compensation and state unemployment tax fees for worksite employees are included in PEO revenues and the associated costs are included in operating expenses.  We enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction ( e.g.
, number of payees or number of payrolls processed).  Fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.  Our service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties. Interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding, and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services.
36 We also recognize revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses ( e.g ., Dealer Services' dealer management systems).  For a majority of our software sales arrangements, which provide hardware, software licenses, installation, and post-contract customer support, revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term, as vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendor-specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition.
We assess collectability of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer's payment history.  We do not believe that a change in our assumptions utilized in the collectability determination would result in a material change to revenues as no single customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues.
Goodwill .  We account for goodwill in accordance with ASC 350-10, which states that goodwill should not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.   We perform this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount.  If the carrying value for a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment, if any.  We determine the fair value of our reporting units using an equal weighted blended approach, which combines the income approach, which is the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital; and the market approach, which is based on using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business.  Significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates, profitability projections, working capital assumptions, the weighted-average cost of capital, the determination of appropriate market comparison companies, and terminal growth rates.   We had $3,113.8 million of goodwill as of June30, 2014 .  Based on the fair value analysis completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 , management concluded that fair value exceeded carrying value for all reporting units and that no reporting units were at risk of goodwill impairment.  In completing the annual impairment test for fiscal 2014 , we evaluated the reasonableness of differences noted between the fair value and carrying value of each reporting unit.  Given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated earnings if we are unable to generate the anticipated revenue growth, synergies and/or cost savings associated with our acquisitions.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, there was an impairment charge of $42.7 million for the ADP AdvancedMD reporting unit.
Income Taxes.
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns.  Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns ( e.g.
, realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof).  In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities.  A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
There is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  Specifically, the likelihood of an entity's tax benefits being sustained must be more likely than not  assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements.  If a tax position drops below the more likely than not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized.  Assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes.  A change in the assessment of the more likely than not standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.  As of June30, 2014 and 2013 , the Company's liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $56.7 million and $70.7 million , respectively.
If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions.  Based on current estimates, favorable settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to $10 million in the next twelve months.  Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
Stock-Based Compensation.
We measure stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant.  We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model.  The binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and employee 37 exercise behavior.  Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors.  Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes.  The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  The binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data.  The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.  Determining these assumptions is subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options.

38 Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Automatic Data Processing, Inc.
Roseland, New Jersey We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June30, 2014 and 2013 , and the related statements of consolidated earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June30, 2014 .  Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and subsidiaries as of June30, 2014 and 2013 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June30, 2014 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the consolidated financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2014 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August8, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

44 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A. Basis of Preparation.
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and its subsidiaries (ADP or the Company) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).  Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses, and accumulated other comprehensive income that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto.  Actual results may differ from those estimates.
B. Description of Business.
The Company is a provider of technology-based outsourcing solutions to employers and vehicle retailers and manufacturers. The Company classifies its operations into the following reportable segments: Employer Services; Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services; and Dealer Services.  The primary components of the Other segment are the results of operations of ADP Indemnity (a wholly-owned captive insurance company that provides workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services worksite employees), non-recurring gains and losses, miscellaneous processing services, such as customer financing transactions, and certain charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as stock-based compensation expense, the goodwill impairment charge for the year ended June 30, 2013 ("fiscal 2013"), and direct and incremental costs incurred to consummate the planned separation of the Dealer Services business.
C. Revenue Recognition.
Revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services ( e.g., Employer Services' payroll processing fees) as well as investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds and other Employer Services' client-related funds.  The Company enters into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction ( e.g., number of payees or number of payrolls processed).  Fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.  Service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties.
PEO revenues are reported net of direct pass-through costs, which are costs billed and incurred for PEO Services worksite employees, primarily consisting of payroll wages and payroll taxes.  Benefits, workers' compensation, and state unemployment tax fees for worksite employees are included in PEO revenues and the associated costs are included in operating expenses.
Interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services.
The Company also recognizes revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses ( e.g.
, Dealer Services' dealer management systems).  For a majority of our software sales arrangements, which provide hardware, software licenses, installation, and post-contract customer support, revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term, as vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist.
The Company assesses the collectability of revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer's payment history.
D. Cash and Cash Equivalents.
Investment securities with a maturity of ninety days or less at the time of purchase are considered cash equivalents.  The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates carrying value.
E. Corporate Investments and Funds Held for Clients.
All of the Company's marketable securities are considered to be available-for-sale and, accordingly, are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.  Unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until realized.  Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities are determined on a specific-identification basis and are included in other income, net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.
If the fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost, the Company assesses whether it intends to 45 sell the security or if it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery.  If either of those two conditions are met, the Company would recognize a charge in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value.  If the Company does not intend to sell a security or it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, the unrealized loss is separated into an amount representing the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other factors, which is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related available-for-sale security as an adjustment to yield using the effective-interest method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
F. Fair Value Measurements.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is based upon the Companys principal or most advantageous market for a specific asset or liability.
U.S. GAAP provides for a three-level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value, defined as follows: Level 1 Fair value is determined based upon quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities that are traded in active markets.
Level 2 Fair value is determined based upon inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, including: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
Level 3 Fair value is determined based upon inputs that are unobservable and reflect the Companys own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based upon the best information available in the circumstances (e.g., internally derived assumptions surrounding the timing and amount of expected cash flows).
Available-for-sale securities included in Level 1 are valued using closing prices for identical instruments that are traded on active exchanges.  Over 99% of the Company's available-for-sale securities included in Level 2 are valued utilizing inputs obtained from an independent pricing service.  To determine the fair value of the Company's Level 2 investments, a variety of inputs are utilized, including benchmark yields, reported trades, non-binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, new issue data, and monthly payment information.  The Company reviews the values generated by the independent pricing service for reasonableness by comparing the valuations received from the independent pricing service to valuations from at least one other observable source.  The Company has not adjusted the prices obtained from the independent pricing service.  The Company has no available-for-sale securities included in Level 3.
The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the classification of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy.  In certain instances, the inputs used to measure fair value may meet the definition of more than one level of the fair value hierarchy.  The significant input with the lowest level priority is used to determine the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy.
G. Long-term Receivables.
Long-term receivables primarily relate to notes receivable from the sale of computer systems to auto, truck, motorcycle, marine, recreational vehicle, and heavy equipment retailers and manufacturers.  Unearned income from finance receivables represents the excess of gross receivables over the sales price of the computer systems financed. Unearned income is amortized using the effective-interest method to maintain a constant rate of return over the term of each contract.
Notes receivable aged over 30 days past due are considered delinquent and notes receivable aged over 60 days past due with known collection issues are placed on non-accrual status. Interest revenue is not recognized on notes receivable while on non-accrual status.Cash payments received on non-accrual receivables are applied towards the principal.When notes receivable on non-accrual status are again less than 60 days past due, recognition of interest revenue for notes receivable is resumed.
The allowance for doubtful accounts on long-term receivables is the Company's best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses related to the Company's existing note receivables.
46 H. Property, Plant and Equipment.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. The estimated useful lives of assets are primarily as follows: Data processing equipment 2 to 5 years Buildings 20 to 40 years Furniture and fixtures 3 to 7 years I. Goodwill.
Goodwill is not amortized, but is instead tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  The Company performs this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of each reporting units to its carrying amount.  If the carrying value for a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company would then compare the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment, if any.  The Company determines the estimated fair value of its reporting units using an equal weighted blended approach, which combines the income approach, which is the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital; and the market approach, which is based on using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business.  Significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates, profitability projections, working capital assumptions, the weighted average cost of capital, the determination of appropriate market comparison companies, and terminal growth rates.   The Company had $3,113.8 million of goodwill as of June30, 2014 .  Based on the fair value analysis completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 , the Company concluded that goodwill fair value exceeded the carrying value for all reporting units.  In fiscal 2013, the Company recognized a $42.7 million impairment on its AdvancedMD reporting unit.
J. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.
K. Foreign Currency Translation.
The net assets of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect for each period, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in the periods.  Gains or losses from balance sheet translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Currency transaction gains or losses, which are included in the results of operations, are immaterial for all periods presented.
L. Foreign Currency Risk Management Programs and Derivative Financial Instruments.
The Company transacts business in various foreign jurisdictions and is therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and are recognized as assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in the fair value of the derivatives recognized in either net earnings from continuing operations or accumulated other comprehensive income, depending on the timing and designated purpose of the derivative.
There were no derivative financial instruments outstanding at June30, 2014 or June30, 2013 .
47 M. Earnings per Share (EPS).
The calculations of basic and diluted EPS are as follows: Years ended June 30, Basic Effect of Employee Stock Option Shares Effect of Employee Restricted Stock Shares Diluted 2014 Net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,502.6 $ 1,502.6 Weighted average shares (in millions) 478.9 2.7 1.5 483.1 EPS from continuing operations $ 3.14 $ 3.11 2013 Net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,358.1 $ 1,358.1 Weighted average shares (in millions) 482.7 3.3 1.1 487.1 EPS from continuing operations $ 2.81 $ 2.79 2012 Net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,375.2 $ 1,375.2 Weighted average shares (in millions) 487.3 3.8 1.1 492.2 EPS from continuing operations $ 2.82 $ 2.79 Options to purchase 1.5 million , 1.2 million , and 0.9 million shares of common stock for the year ended June30, 2014 ("fiscal 2014 "), fiscal 2013 , and the year ended June 30, 2012 ("fiscal 2012 "), respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their exercise prices exceeded the average market price of outstanding common shares for the respective periods.
N. Stock-Based Compensation.
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense in net earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant.  The Company determines the fair value of stock options issued using a binomial option-pricing model.  The binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and employee exercise behavior.  Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of the Company's stock price, and other factors.  Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes.  The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  The binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data.  The expected life of a stock option grant is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
O. Internal Use Software.
Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a three to five-year period on a straight-line basis.  The Company's policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. In addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance, and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred.  The Company also expenses internal costs related to minor upgrades and enhancements, as it is impractical to separate these costs from normal maintenance activities.
P. Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed.
The Company capitalizes certain costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed.  The Company's policy provides for the capitalization of all software production costs upon reaching technological feasibility for a specific product.  Technological feasibility is attained when software products have a completed working model whose consistency with the overall product design has been confirmed by testing.  Costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as incurred.  The establishment of technological feasibility requires judgment by management and in many instances is only attained a short time prior to the general release of the software.  Upon the general release of the software product to customers, capitalization ceases and such costs are amortized over a three-year period on a straight-line basis.  Maintenance-related costs are expensed as incurred.
48 Q. Income Taxes.
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns.  The Company is subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities.
There is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  Specifically, the likelihood of  an entity's tax benefits being sustained must be more likely than not, assuming that these positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements.  If a tax position drops below the more likely than not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized.  Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes.  As of June30, 2014 and 2013 , the Company's liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $56.7 million and $70.7 million , respectively.
If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions.  Based on current estimates, favorable settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings by up to $10 million .  Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability, and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
R. Workers' Compensation Costs.
The Company employs a third-party actuary to assist in determining the estimated claim liability related to workers' compensation and employer's liability coverage for PEO Services worksite employees. In estimating ultimate loss rates, we utilize historical loss experience, exposure data, and actuarial judgment, together with a range of inputs which are primarily based upon the worksite employee's job responsibilities, their location, the historical frequency and severity of workers' compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. For each reporting period, changes in the actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers' compensation claims cost estimates. The Company has secured specific per occurrence insurance that caps the exposure for each claim at $1 million per occurrence, and has also secured aggregate stop loss insurance that caps aggregate losses at a certain level in each policy year.   Additionally, for fiscal 2013 and 2014, the Company entered into reinsurance arrangements to cover substantially all losses incurred by the Company for the fiscal 2013 and 2014 policy years up to the $1 million per occurrence related to workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO services worksite employees.
S. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.  ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue depicting the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 will also result in enhanced revenue related disclosures.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company has not yet determined the impact of  ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, "Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity."  ASU 2014-08 requires that a disposal representing a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entitys financial results or a business activity classified as held for sale should be reported as discontinued operations.  ASU 2014-08 also expands the disclosure requirements for discontinued operations and adds new disclosures for individually significant dispositions that do not qualify as discontinued operations.  ASU 2014-08 is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2014.  The impact of ASU 2014-08 is dependent upon the nature of dispositions, if any, after adoption.
In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.  ASU 2013-11 requires netting of unrecognized tax benefits against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carryforward that would apply in settlement of the uncertain tax position.  ASU 2013-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.  Retrospective adoption is permitted.  The adoption of ASU 2013-11 will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
49 In July 2013, the Company adopted ASU 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220):  Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. ASU 2013-02 requires entities to disclose the amount of income (loss) reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income to each respective line item on the income statement.  The guidance allows companies to elect whether to disclose the reclassification either on the face of the income statement or in the notes to the financial statements, including cross-referencing other disclosures which provide additional details about these amounts.  The Company has elected to disclose the reclassification in the notes to the financial statements with cross-references to other disclosures which provide additional details about the amounts.  The adoption of ASU 2013-02 did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
NOTE 2. SEPARATION OF DEALER SERVICES On April10, 2014 , the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to spin-off the Companys Dealer Services business into an independently publicly-traded company through a tax-free spin-off of 100% of Dealer Services to ADP shareholders.  The Company has requested an opinion from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, its counsel, to the effect that, based on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings set forth in the request, the distribution will qualify as a transaction that is tax-free under Section 355 and other related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.  The distribution is conditioned upon, among other things, the receipt by the Company of such a favorable opinion of counsel confirming the distributions tax-free status.  The separation is subject to other conditions, including necessary regulatory approvals.  ADP has also requested rulings from the IRS and other jurisdictions with respect to certain discrete and significant issues arising in connection with the transactions being effected in connection with the separation and distribution.
On June10, 2014 , Dealer Services (under the name of Dealer Services Holdings LLC) filed a registration statement on Form 10 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Additionally, Dealer Services Holdings LLC filed an amendment to its Form 10 on July 25, 2014.  The financial presentation of Dealer Services in the Form 10 differs from the financial presentation of the Dealer Services segment in ADPs financial statements due to adjustments made in the Form 10 to reflect the additional corporate expenses and other operating costs of Dealer Services as if it were a stand-alone company.
Upon completion of the spin-off, ADP shareholders will have separate ownership interests in ADP and Dealer Services.  ADP and Dealer Services will be two distinct businesses with separate ownership and management.  To facilitate Dealer Services separation from ADP, ADP will provide certain services to Dealer Services during a transition period following completion of the spin-off.  ADP expects to incur approximately $40.0 million to $50.0 million of incremental separation costs during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 ("fiscal 2015") related to the spin-off.  Incremental costs associated with the spin-off of $14.9 million for fiscal 2014 are included in separation costs on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings and are principally related to professional services.
NOTE 3. OTHER INCOME, NET Other income, net consists of the following: Years ended June 30, 2014 2013 2012 Interest income on corporate funds $ (56.2 ) $ (64.5 ) $ (85.2 ) Realized gains on available-for-sale securities (20.4 ) (32.1 ) (32.1 ) Realized losses on available-for-sale securities 3.9 3.5 7.7 Impairment losses on available-for-sale securities   5.8 Impairment losses on assets held for sale   2.2 Gains on sales of buildings  (2.2 )  Gain on sale of assets   (66.0 ) Other, net (0.2 ) (0.9 ) (3.2 ) Other income, net $ (72.9 ) $ (96.2 ) $ (170.8 ) During fiscal 2013, the Company completed the sale of two buildings that were previously classified as assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and, as a result, recorded gains of $2.2 million in other income, net, on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.
During fiscal 2012, the Company sold assets related to rights and obligations to resell a third-party expense management platform, and, as a result, recorded a gain of $66.0 million in other income, net, on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.
50 During fiscal 2012, the Company completed the sale of two buildings for their combined carrying value of $6.9 million , net of selling costs. The Company had previously classified these assets as assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognized impairment losses within other income, net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings of $2.2 million in fiscal 2012.
During fiscal 2012, the Company concluded that it had the intent to sell certain available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses of $5.8 million .  As such, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $5.8 million in other income, net, on the Statements of  Consolidated Earnings.
NOTE 4. ACQUISITIONS Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations were recorded on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the respective acquisition dates based upon their estimated fair values at such dates. The results of operations of businesses acquired by the Company have been included in the Statements of Consolidated Earnings since their respective dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill. In certain circumstances, the allocations of the excess purchase price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions and subject to revision when the Company receives final information, including appraisals and other analysis. Accordingly, the measurement period for such purchase price allocations will end when the information, or the facts and circumstances, becomes available, but will not exceed twelve months.
The Company acquired two businesses during fiscal 2014 for approximately $28.5 million , net of cash acquired.  As of June30, 2014 , the Company had not yet finalized the purchase price allocations for these two acquisitions.
The Company acquired two businesses during fiscal 2013 for approximately $40.4 million , net of cash acquired.  The Company finalized the purchase price allocation for these two acquisitions during fiscal 2014 and adjusted the preliminary values allocated to certain assets and liabilities in order to reflect final information received.
The Company acquired seven businesses in fiscal 2012 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $292.3 million , net of cash acquired.  These acquisitions resulted in approximately $182.6 million of goodwill. Intangible assets acquired, which total approximately $90.0 million for these seven acquisitions, included customer contracts and lists, software, and trademarks that are being amortized over a weighted average life of approximately 11 years .
The Company reviews estimates of the fair value of contingent consideration ("earn-out") expected to be paid in the event that certain performance metrics are achieved over an earn-out period and makes adjustments when facts and circumstances warrant.  The Company made contingent payments relating to previously consummated acquisitions of $3.5 million , $14.5 million , and $2.8 million during fiscal 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 .

NOTE 8.  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment at cost and accumulated depreciation at June 30, 2014 and 2013 are as follows: June 30, 2014 2013 Property, plant, and equipment: Land and buildings $ 749.2 $ 731.7 Data processing equipment 863.8 849.5 Furniture, leaseholds, and other 512.7 459.5 2,125.7 2,040.7 Less: accumulated depreciation (1,348.3 ) (1,312.1 ) Property, plant, and equipment, net $ 777.4 $ 728.6 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment was $163.2 million , $149.9 million , and $146.8 million for fiscal 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively.
NOTE 9. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET Changes in goodwill for the fiscal year ended June30, 2014 and 2013 are as follows: Employer Services PEO Services Dealer Services Total Balance at June 30, 2012 $ 1,874.2 $ 4.8 $ 1,169.6 $ 3,048.6 Additions and other adjustments, net 29.4  0.8 30.2 Currency translation adjustments 4.5  (1.4 ) 3.1 Goodwill impairment (42.7 )   (42.7 ) Balance at June 30, 2013 $ 1,865.4 $ 4.8 $ 1,169.0 $ 3,039.2 Additions and other adjustments, net 0.3  23.8 24.1 Currency translation adjustments 16.7  33.8 50.5 Balance at June 30, 2014 $ 1,882.4 $ 4.8 $ 1,226.6 $ 3,113.8 57 In fiscal 2014, the Company performed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill and determined that there was no impairment.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $42.7 million related to the ADP AdvancedMD reporting unit.  The goodwill impairment was due to a decrease in the estimated fair value of the business resulting from a decline in the new business bookings growth and profitability projections of the business.
The remeasurement of goodwill is classified as a Level 3 fair value assessment due to the significance of unobservable inputs developed using Company-specific information.  The Company determined the fair value utilizing the income approach and the market approach.  Under the income approach, the Company calculated the fair value based on the present value of the estimated cash flows.  Cash flow projections were based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and net operating income margins, taking into consideration market and industry conditions.  The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the risk, size premium, and business specific characteristics related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows.  Under the market approach, the Company evaluated the fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit.  The unobservable inputs used to measure the fair value included projected revenue growth rates, profitability projections, working capital assumptions, the weighted average cost of capital, the determination of appropriate market comparison companies, and terminal growth rates.
In fiscal 2013, since the annual impairment test indicated that ADP AdvancedMD's carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, a second phase of the goodwill impairment test ("Step 2") was performed specific to this business.  Under Step 2, the fair values of all assets and liabilities were estimated, including tangible assets, existing technology, customer lists, and trademarks for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill.  The implied fair value of goodwill was then compared to the recorded goodwill to determine the amount of impairment.  Assumptions used in measuring the value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates, royalty rates, and attrition rates used in valuing the intangible assets.  Upon completion of the annual test, the ADP AdvancedMD reporting unit was determined to be impaired.  ADP AdvancedMD is currently reported in our Employer Services segment.
There were no accumulated goodwill impairments as of June 30, 2012.
Components of intangible assets, net, are as follows: June 30, 2014 2013 Intangible assets: Software and software licenses $ 1,626.9 $ 1,511.1 Customer contracts and lists 870.1 848.9 Other intangibles 241.4 241.7 2,738.4 2,601.7 Less accumulated amortization: Software and software licenses (1,318.4 ) (1,239.5 ) Customer contracts and lists (591.2 ) (534.3 ) Other intangibles (196.5 ) (184.7 ) (2,106.1 ) (1,958.5 ) Intangible assets, net $ 632.3 $ 643.2 Other intangibles consist primarily of purchased rights, covenants, patents, and trademarks (acquired directly or through acquisitions).All of the intangible assets have finite lives and, as such, are subject to amortization.The weighted average remaining useful life of the intangible assets is 7 years ( 4 years for software and software licenses, 9 years for customer contracts and lists, and 7 years for other intangibles).Amortization of intangible assets was $173.0 million , $166.8 million , and $172.5 million for fiscal 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively.

The Companys U.S. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained through a commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $7.25 billion in aggregate maturity value of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities.  In July 2014, the Company increased the U.S. short-term commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to $7.5 billion in aggregate maturity value.

The weighted average maturity of the Companys commercial paper in fiscal 2014 and 2013 approximated 2 days .
The Companys U.S. and Canadian short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities.These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days .  At June30, 2014 , there were no outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements.

Compensation expense relating to the issuance of performance-based restricted stock is measured based upon the fair value of the award on the grant date and recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based upon the probability that the performance target will be met.  After the performance period, if the performance targets are achieved, employees are eligible to receive dividends on shares awarded under the performance-based restricted stock program.
Performance-based restricted stock units are settled in either cash or stock, depending on the employee's home country, and cannot be transferred during the vesting period.  Compensation expense relating to the issuance of performance-based restricted stock units settled in cash is recorded over the vesting period and is initially based on the fair value of the award on the grant date and is subsequently remeasured at each reporting date during the one-year performance period, based upon the probability that the performance target will be met.  Compensation expense relating to the issuance of performance-based restricted stock units settled in stock is recorded over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award on the grant date.  Dividend equivalents are paid on awards settled in stock under the performance-based restricted stock unit program.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
The Company offers an employee stock purchase plan that allows eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price equal to 95% of the market value for the Company's common stock on the last day of the offering period.This plan has been deemed non-compensatory and therefore, no compensation expense has been recorded.
The Company currently utilizes treasury stock to satisfy stock option exercises, issuances under the Company's employee stock purchase plan, and restricted stock awards.From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs.The Company repurchased 9.0 million shares in fiscal 2014 as compared to 10.4 million shares repurchased in fiscal 2013 .  The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.  Cash payments related to the settlement of vested time-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units were approximately $1.2 million , $17.8 million , and $15.4 million during fiscal years 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 .
60 The following table represents stock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits in each of fiscal 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively: Years ended June 30, 2014 2013 2012 Operating expenses $ 25.7 $ 17.9 $ 17.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 93.7 64.0 62.6 System development and programming costs 19.0 14.5 14.3 Total pretax stock-based compensation expense $ 138.4 $ 96.4 $ 94.1 Income tax benefit $ 49.5 $ 34.3 $ 33.5 As of June30, 2014 , the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards amounted to $16.8 million , $26.7 million , and $89.9 million , respectively, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service periods of 2.1 years , 1.3 years , and 1.3 years , respectively.
In fiscal 2014 , the following activity occurred under the Companys existing plans: Stock Options: Year ended June 30, 2014 Number of Options (in thousands) Weighted Average Price (in dollars) Options outstanding, beginning of year 11,110 $ 44 Options granted 1,489 $ 79 Options exercised (4,485 ) $ 41 Options canceled (183 ) $ 48 Options outstanding, end of year 7,931 $ 52 Options exercisable, end of year 5,005 $ 42 Shares available for future grants, end of year 27,153 Shares reserved for issuance under stock option plans, end of year 35,084 Time-Based Restricted Stock and Time-Based Restricted Stock Units: Year ended June 30, 2014 Number of Shares (in thousands) Number of Units (in thousands) Restricted shares/units outstanding at July 1, 2013 1,313 280 Restricted shares/units granted 1,290 308 Restricted shares/units vested (167 )  Restricted shares/units forfeited (95 ) (17 ) Restricted shares/units outstanding at June 30, 2014 2,341 571 Performance-Based Restricted Stock and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units: Year ended June 30, 2014 Number of Shares (in thousands) Number of Units (in thousands) Restricted shares/units outstanding at July 1, 2013 521 38 Restricted shares/units granted 599 307 Restricted shares/units vested (264 ) (22 ) Restricted shares/units forfeited (53 ) (5 ) Restricted shares/units outstanding at June 30, 2014 803 318 61 The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding and exercisable as of June30, 2014 was $216.9 million and $185.1 million , respectively, which has a remaining life of 5.4 years and 3.4 years , respectively.  The aggregate intrinsic value for stock options exercised in fiscal 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 was $156.3 million , $135.1 million , and $83.8 million , respectively.
The fair value of each stock option issued is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option pricing model.The binomial model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, risk-free interest rate, and employee exercise behavior.Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of the Companys stock price, and other factors.Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes.  The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.The binomial model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data.The expected life of the stock option grant is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
The fair value for stock options granted was estimated at the date of grant using the following assumptions: 2014 2013 2012 Risk-free interest rate 1.5% - 1.7% 0.8% - 1.0% 0.8% - 1.0% Dividend yield 2.3% - 2.4% 2.7% - 2.9% 2.8% - 3.1% Weighted average volatility factor 23.8 % 23.5% - 24.4% 24.9% - 25.9% Weighted average expected life (in years) 5.4 5.3 - 5.4 5.2 - 5.3 Weighted average fair value (in dollars) $ 13.53 $ 8.63 $ 8.46 The weighted average fair values of shares granted were as follows: Year ended June 30, 2014 2013 2012 Performance-based restricted stock $ 60.38 $ 55.13 $ 44.33 Time-based restricted stock $ 71.50 $ 58.72 $ 54.40 B.Pension Plans The Company has a defined benefit cash balance pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees, under which employees are credited with a percentage of base pay plus interest.  The plan interest credit rate varies from year-to-year based on the ten -year U.S. Treasury rate.  Employees are fully vested upon completion of three years of service. The Company's policy is to make contributions within the range determined by generally accepted actuarial principles.  In addition, the Company has various retirement plans for its non-U.S. employees and maintains a Supplemental Officers Retirement Plan (SORP).  The SORP is a defined benefit plan pursuant to which the Company pays supplemental pension benefits to certain key officers upon retirement based upon the officers' years of service and compensation.
A June 30 measurement date was used in determining the Company's benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets.
The Company is required to (a) recognize in its Consolidated Balance Sheets an asset for a plan's net overfunded status or a liability for a plan's net underfunded status, (b) measure a plan's assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer's fiscal year, and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit plan in the year in which the changes occur in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
62 The Company's pension plans' funded status as of June30, 2014 and 2013 is as follows: June 30, 2014 2013 Change in plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 1,676.1 $ 1,469.5 Actual return on plan assets 311.1 121.0 Employer contributions 84.7 135.3 Currency translation adjustments 4.2 (1.5 ) Benefits paid (52.0 ) (48.2 ) Fair value of plan assets at end of year $ 2,024.1 $ 1,676.1 Change in benefit obligation: Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 1,427.8 $ 1,412.1 Service cost 66.4 67.2 Interest cost 62.6 55.1 Actuarial losses/(gains) 87.2 (58.6 ) Currency translation adjustments 6.7 0.2 Benefits paid (52.0 ) (48.2 ) Projected benefit obligation at end of year $ 1,598.7 $ 1,427.8 Funded status - plan assets less benefit obligations $ 425.4 $ 248.3 The amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June30, 2014 and 2013 consisted of: June 30, 2014 2013 Noncurrent assets $ 551.4 $ 362.6 Current liabilities (5.6 ) (4.7 ) Noncurrent liabilities (120.4 ) (109.6 ) Net amount recognized $ 425.4 $ 248.3 The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $1,581.9 million and $1,412.8 million at June30, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
The Company's pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of June30, 2014 and 2013 had the following projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets: June 30, 2014 2013 Projected benefit obligation $ 142.6 $ 127.7 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 127.8 $ 115.3 Fair value of plan assets $ 16.7 $ 14.2 63 The components of net pension expense were as follows: 2014 2013 2012 Service cost  benefits earned during the period $ 66.4 $ 67.2 $ 57.2 Interest cost on projected benefits 62.6 55.1 62.1 Expected return on plan assets (119.4 ) (109.5 ) (97.6 ) Net amortization and deferral 20.1 30.9 15.0 Net pension expense $ 29.7 $ 43.7 $ 36.7 The net actuarial loss, prior service cost, and transition obligation for the defined benefit pension plans that are included in accumulated other comprehensive income that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost are $189.4 million , $4.2 million , and $0.3 million , respectively, at June30, 2014 .  The estimated net actuarial loss, prior service cost, and transition obligation for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost over the next fiscal year are $16.3 million , $0.9 million , and $0.2 million , respectively, at June30, 2014 .
Assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of benefit obligations were: Years ended June 30, 2014 2013 Discount rate 4.05 % 4.50 % Increase in compensation levels 4.00 % 4.00 % Assumptions used to determine the net pension expense generally were: Years ended June 30, 2014 2013 2012 Discount rate 4.50 % 3.90 % 5.40 % Expected long-term rate of return on assets 7.25 % 7.25 % 7.25 % Increase in compensation levels 4.00 % 4.00 % 4.00 % The discount rate is based upon published rates for high-quality fixed-income investments that produce cash flows that approximate the timing and amount of expected future benefit payments.
The expected long-term rate of return on assets is determined based on historical and expected future rates of return on plan assets considering the target asset mix and the long-term investment strategy.
Plan Assets The Company's pension plans' asset allocations at June30, 2014 and 2013 by asset category were as follows: 2014 2013 U.S. fixed income securities 33 % 31 % U.S. equity securities 20 % 21 % International equity securities 21 % 21 % Global equity securities 26 % 27 % 100 % 100 % The Company's pension plans' asset investment strategy is designed to ensure prudent management of assets, consistent with long-term return objectives and the prompt fulfillment of all pension plan obligations.  The investment strategy and asset mix were developed in coordination with an asset liability study conducted by external consultants to maximize the funded ratio 64 with the least amount of volatility.  In fiscal 2013, the Company revised the target asset allocation of the U.S. pension plan to include global equities as a separate asset class to enhance the diversification of overall pension plan investments.
The pension plans' assets are currently invested in various asset classes with differing expected rates of return, correlations and volatilities, including large capitalization and small capitalization U.S. equities, international equities, U.S. fixed income securities and cash.
The target asset allocation ranges for the U.S. plan are generally as follows: U.S. fixed income securities 35% - 45% U.S. equity securities 14% - 24% International equity securities 11% - 21% Global equity securities 20% - 30% The pension plans' fixed income portfolio is designed to match the duration and liquidity characteristics of the pension plans' liabilities.  In addition, the pension plans invest only in investment-grade debt securities to ensure preservation of capital.  The pension plans' equity portfolios are subject to diversification guidelines to reduce the impact of losses in single investments.  Investment managers are prohibited from buying or selling commodities and from the short selling of securities.
None of the pension plans' assets are directly invested in the Company's stock, although the pension plans may hold a minimal amount of Company stock to the extent of the Company's participation in the S&P 500 Index.
The pension plans' investments included in Level 1 are valued using closing prices for identical instruments that are traded on active exchanges.  The pension plans' investments included in Level 2 are valued utilizing inputs obtained from an independent pricing service, which are reviewed by the Company for reasonableness.  To determine the fair value of our Level 2 plan assets, a variety of inputs are utilized, including benchmark yields, reported trades, non-binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, new issue data, and monthly payment information.  The pension plans have no Level 3 investments at June30, 2014 .
The following table presents the investments of the pension plans measured at fair value at June30, 2014 : Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Commingled trusts $  $ 1,261.1 $  $ 1,261.1 U.S. government securities  271.9  271.9 Mutual funds 88.2   88.2 Corporate and municipal bonds  368.3  368.3 Mortgage-backed security bonds  22.9  22.9 Total pension assets $ 88.2 $ 1,924.2 $  $ 2,012.4 In addition to the investments in the above table, the pension plans also held cash and cash equivalents of $11.7 million as of June30, 2014 , which have been classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The following table presents the investments of the pension plans measured at fair value at June30, 2013 : Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Commingled trusts $  $ 1,050.7 $  $ 1,050.7 U.S. government securities  228.3  228.3 Mutual funds 79.2   79.2 Corporate and municipal bonds  252.5  252.5 Mortgage-backed security bonds  22.7  22.7 Total pension assets $ 79.2 $ 1,554.2 $  $ 1,633.4 65 In addition to the investments in the above table, the pension plans also held cash and cash equivalents of $42.7 million as of June30, 2013 , which have been classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Contributions During fiscal 2014 , the Company contributed $84.7 million to the pension plans.  The Company expects to contribute $9.5 million to the pension plans during fiscal 2015 .
Estimated Future Benefit Payments The benefits expected to be paid in each year from fiscal 2015 to 2019 are $61.3 million , $66.9 million , $76.5 million , $85.6 million and $93.8 million , respectively.  The aggregate benefits expected to be paid in the five fiscal years from 2020 to 2024 are $609.4 million .  The expected benefits to be paid are based on the same assumptions used to measure the Company's pension plans' benefit obligations at June30, 2014 and includes estimated future employee service.
C. Retirement and Savings Plan.
The Company has a 401(k) retirement and savings plan, which allows eligible employees to contribute up to 50% of their compensation annually and allows highly compensated employees to contribute up to 12% of their compensation annually. The Company matches a portion of employee contributions, which amounted to approximately $77.6 million , $72.0 million , and $65.9 million for the calendar years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , respectively.

There are $97.5 million and $138.0 million of current deferred tax liabilities included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June30, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
Income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in an aggregate amount of approximately $1,031.6 million as of June30, 2014 , as the Company considers such earnings to be permanently reinvested 67 outside of the United States.  The additional U.S. income tax that would arise on repatriation of the remaining undistributed earnings could be offset, in part, by foreign tax credits on such repatriation. However, it is impracticable to estimate the amount of net income tax that might be payable.
The Company has estimated foreign net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $105.5 million as of June30, 2014 , of which $47.3 million expire through 2034 and $58.2 million has an indefinite utilization period.  As of June30, 2014 , the Company has approximately $77.8 million of federal net operating loss carry-forwards from acquired companies.  The net operating losses have an annual utilization limitation pursuant to section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and expire through 2030 .
The Company has state net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $193.6 million as of June30, 2014 , which expire through 2033 .
The Company has recorded valuation allowances of $44.0 million and $48.8 million at June30, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, to reflect the estimated amount of domestic and foreign deferred tax assets that may not be realized.
Income tax payments were approximately $821.5 million , $691.0 million , and $658.7 million for fiscal 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively.
As of June 30, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 the Company's liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $56.7 million , $70.7 million , and $84.7 million respectively. The amount that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate is $31.2 million , $38.8 million , and $43.7 million , respectively.  The remainder, if recognized, would principally impact deferred taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: Fiscal  2014 Fiscal  2013 Fiscal  2012 Unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of the year $ 70.7 $ 84.7 $ 105.7 Additions for tax positions 3.6 5.0 8.0 Reductions for tax positions   (0.8 ) Additions for tax positions of prior periods 7.0 5.3 13.0 Reductions for tax positions of prior periods (7.4 ) (3.7 ) (21.6 ) Settlement with tax authorities (4.4 ) (12.0 ) (4.2 ) Expiration of the statute of limitations (13.7 ) (9.7 ) (9.8 ) Impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 0.9 1.1 (5.6 ) Unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 56.7 $ 70.7 $ 84.7 Interest expense and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions have been recorded in the provision for income taxes on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.  During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , the Company recorded interest (benefit) expense of $(3.4) million , $0.4 million , and $1.2 million , respectively.

At June30, 2014 , the Company had accrued interest of $10.7 million recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $0.1 million was recorded within income taxes payable, and the remainder was recorded within other liabilities.  At June30, 2013 , the Company had accrued interest of $12.2 million recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $1.2 million was recorded within income taxes payable, and the remainder was recorded within other liabilities.  At June30, 2014 , the Company had accrued penalties of $0.6 million recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $0.1 million was recorded within income taxes payable, and the remainder was recorded within other liabilities.

The Company is routinely examined by the IRS and tax authorities in foreign countries in which it conducts business, as well as tax authorities in states in which it has significant business operations. The tax years currently under examination vary by jurisdiction.  Examinations in progress in which the Company has significant business operations are as follows: 68 Taxing Jurisdiction Fiscal Years under Examination U.S. (IRS) 2013-2014 Arizona 1998-2007 Illinois 2004-2011 Minnesota 2005-2012 New York 2007-2009 New Jersey 2002-2009 The Company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments resulting from examinations in each of the jurisdictions.  The resolution of tax matters is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although a resolution could have a material impact on the Company's Statements of Consolidated Earnings for a particular future period and on the Company's effective tax rate.
If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions.  Based on current estimates, settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to $10 million in the next twelve months.  Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
In fiscal 2014 , the Company reached agreements with the IRS regarding all outstanding tax audit issues in dispute for the tax years through and including June 30, 2012 , which did not have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
NOTE 13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company has obligations under various facilities and equipment leases and software license agreements. Total expense under these agreements was approximately $306.0 million , $270.1 million , and $252.6 million in fiscal 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively, with minimum commitments at June30, 2014 as follows: Years ending June 30, 2015 $ 209.9 2016 147.3 2017 87.9 2018 53.2 2019 29.8 Thereafter 32.6 $ 560.7 In addition to fixed rentals, certain leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices.
As of June30, 2014 , the Company has purchase commitments of approximately $780.4 million , including a reinsurance premium with ACE American Insurance Company for the fiscal 2015 policy year, as well as obligations related to purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment, and other assets, of which $379.7 million relates to fiscal 2015 , $157.2 million relates to the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016 and the remaining $243.5 million relates to fiscal years ending June 30, 2017 through fiscal 2019 .
On July 18, 2011, athenahealth, Inc. filed a patent infringement lawsuit against ADP AdvancedMD, Inc. ("ADP AdvancedMD"), a subsidiary of the Company, seeking monetary damages, injunctive relief, and costs. The allegations include a claimthat ADP AdvancedMD's activities in providing medical practice management and billing and revenue management 69 software and associated services to physicians and medical practice managers infringe a patent owned by athenahealth, Inc. The parties are currently engaged in the discovery process and the court has not yet set a trial date. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to this lawsuit and continues to vigorously defend itself against the allegations.
In June 2011, the Company received a Commissioners Charge from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging that the Company has violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by refusing to recruit, hire, transfer and promote certain persons on the basis of their race, in the State of Illinois from at least the period of January 1, 2007 to the present.The Company continues to investigate the allegations set forth in the Commissioners Charge and is cooperating with the EEOCs investigation.
The Company is subject to various claims and litigation in the normal course of business.  When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, the Company records a liability in the amount of its best estimate for the ultimate loss.  At this time, the Company is unable to estimate any reasonably possible loss, or range of reasonably possible loss, with respect to the matters described above.  This is primarily because these matters involve complex issues subject to inherent uncertainty.  There can be no assurance that these matters will be resolved in a manner that is not adverse to the Company.
It is not the Companys business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Companys services and products.The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.

70 NOTE 15. FINANCIAL DATA BY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA Based upon similar economic and operational characteristics, the Companys strategic business units have been aggregated into the following three reportable segments: Employer Services, PEO Services, and Dealer Services.The primary components of the Other segment are the results of operations of ADP Indemnity (a wholly-owned captive insurance company that provides workers compensation and employers liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services worksite employees), non-recurring gains and losses, miscellaneous processing services, such as customer financing transactions, and certain charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as stock-based compensation expense, the fiscal 2014 separation costs related to the planned separation of Dealer Services, and the fiscal 2013 goodwill impairment charge.
Certain revenues and expenses are charged to the reportable segments at a standard rate for management reasons.Other costs are recorded based on management responsibility.There is a reconciling item for the difference between actual interest income earned on invested funds held for clients and interest credited to Employer Services and PEO Services at a standard rate of 4.5% .This allocation is made for management reasons so that the reportable segments' results are presented on a consistent basis without the impact of fluctuations in interest rates.  This reconciling adjustment to the reportable segments' revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes is eliminated in consolidation.
To align financial reporting with the manner in which the Company's chief operating decision maker assesses performance and makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the reportable segments, effective July 1, 2013, the Company no longer allocates a cost of capital charge to its reportable segments and no longer adjusts the operating results of its reportable segments on a constant exchange rate basis. As a result of these changes, all prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These changes did not significantly affect reportable segment results.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Attached as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K are certifications of ADP's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which are required by Rule 13a-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). This Controls and Procedures section should be read in conjunction with the report of Deloitte & Touche LLP that appears on page 77 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
Management's Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company carried out an evaluation (the evaluation), under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June30, 2014 in ensuring that (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (ii) such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting It is the responsibility of Automatic Data Processing, Inc.'s (ADP) management to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to ADP's management and board of directors regarding the preparation of reliable financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
ADP's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of ADP; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of ADP are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of ADP; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of ADP's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements of ADP.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Management has performed an assessment of the effectiveness of ADP's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2014 based upon criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management determined that ADP's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June30, 2014 .
74 Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of ADP included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the operating effectiveness of ADP's internal control over financial reporting. The Deloitte & Touche LLP attestation report is set forth below.
/s/Carlos A. Rodriguez Carlos A. Rodriguez President and Chief Executive Officer /s/Jan Siegmund Jan Siegmund Chief Financial Officer Roseland, New Jersey August8, 2014 75 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in ADP's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, ADP's internal control over financial reporting.
76 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Automatic Data Processing, Inc.
Roseland, New Jersey We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2014, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended June 30, 2014 of the Company and our report dated August8, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule.
