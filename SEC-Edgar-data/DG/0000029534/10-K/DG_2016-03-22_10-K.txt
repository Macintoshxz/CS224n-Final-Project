1 PART I ITEM 1.BUSINESS General We are among the largest discount retailers in the United States by number of stores, with 12,575stores located in 43 states as of February26, 2016, with the greatest concentration of stores in the southern, southwestern, midwestern and eastern United States. We offer a broad selection of merchandise, including consumables, seasonal, home products and apparel. Our merchandise includes high quality national brands from leading manufacturers, as well as comparable quality private brand selections with prices at substantial discounts to national brands. We offer our merchandise at everyday low prices through our convenient small-box locations.
Our History J.L. Turner founded our Company in 1939 as J.L. Turner and Son, Wholesale. We were incorporated as a Kentucky corporation under the name J.L. Turner& Son,Inc. in 1955, when we opened our first Dollar General store. We changed our name to Dollar General Corporation in 1968 and reincorporated in 1998 as a Tennessee corporation. Our common stock was publicly traded from 1968 until July 2007, when we merged with an entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts&Co.L.P., or KKR. In November 2009 our common stock again became publicly traded, and in December 2013 the entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with KKR sold its remaining shares of our common stock.
Our Business Model Our long history of profitable growth is founded on a commitment to a relatively simple business model: providing a broad base of customers with their basic everyday and household needs, supplemented with a variety of general merchandise items, at everyday low prices in conveniently located, small-box stores. We continually evaluate the needs and demands of our customers and modify our merchandise selections and pricing accordingly, while remaining focused on increasing profitability and returns for our shareholders.
Our operating priorities are summarized as follows: 1)driving profitable sales growth, 2)capturing growth opportunities, 3)enhancing our position as a low-cost operator, and 4)investing in our people as a competitive advantage. For more information on these operating priorities, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under the heading "Executive Overview", included in PartII, Item7 of this report.
In fiscal year 2015, we achieved our 26 th consecutive year of same-store sales growth. This growth, which has taken place in a variety of economic conditions, suggests that we have a less cyclical business model than most retailers and, we believe, is a result of our compelling value and convenience proposition.
Compelling Value and Convenience Proposition.
Our ability to deliver highly competitive prices in convenient locations and our easy "in and out" shopping format create a compelling shopping experience that distinguishes us from other discount retailers as well as convenience, drug and grocery retailers. Our slogan "Save time. Save money. Every day!" summarizes our appeal to customers. We believe our ability to effectively deliver both value and convenience allows us to succeed in small markets with limited shopping alternatives, as well as to profitably coexist alongside larger retailers in 2 more competitive markets. Our value and convenience proposition is evidenced by the following attributes of our business model:  Convenient Locations.
Our stores are conveniently located in a variety of rural, suburban and urban communities. We seek to locate our stores in close proximity to our customers, which drives customer loyalty and trip frequency and makes us an attractive alternative to large discount and other large-box retail and grocery stores.
Time-Saving Shopping Experience.
We also provide customers with a highly convenient, easy to navigate shopping experience. Our small box stores are easy to get in and out of quickly. Our product offering includes most necessities, such as basic packaged and refrigerated food and dairy products, cleaning supplies, paper products, health and beauty care items, greeting cards, basic apparel, housewares, hardware and automotive supplies, among others. Our convenient hours and broad merchandise offering allow our customers to fulfill their routine shopping requirements and minimize their need to shop elsewhere.
Everyday Low Prices on Quality Merchandise.
Our research indicates that we offer a price advantage over most food and drug retailers and that our prices are highly competitive with even the largest discount retailers. Our ability to offer everyday low prices on quality merchandise is supported by our low-cost operating structure and our strategy to maintain a limited number of items per merchandise category, which we believe helps us maintain strong purchasing power. We offer quality nationally advertised brands at these everyday low prices in addition to offering our own comparable quality private brands at value prices.
Substantial Growth Opportunities.
We believe we have substantial long-term growth potential in the U.S. We have identified significant opportunities to add new stores in both existing and new markets. In addition, we have opportunities to relocate or remodel locations within our existing store base to better serve our customers. Our attractive store economics, including a relatively low initial investment and simple, low-cost operating model have allowed us to grow our store base to current levels and provide us significant opportunities to continue our profitable store growth strategy.
Our Merchandise We offer a focused assortment of everyday necessities, which drive frequent customer visits, and key items in a broad range of general merchandise categories. Our product assortment provides the opportunity for our customers to address most of their basic shopping needs with one trip. We sell high-quality nationally advertised brands from leading manufacturers. Additionally, our private brand consumables offer even greater value with options to purchase value items and national brand equivalent products at substantial discounts to the national brand.
Consumables is our largest merchandise category and has become a larger percentage of our total sales in recent years as indicated in the table below. Consumables include paper and cleaning products (such as paper towels, bath tissue, paper dinnerware, trash and storage bags, laundry and other home cleaning supplies); packaged food (such as cereals, canned soups and vegetables, condiments, spices, sugar and flour); perishables (such as milk, eggs, bread, frozen meals, beer and wine); snacks (such as candy, cookies, crackers, salty snacks and carbonated beverages); health and beauty (such as over-the-counter medicines and personal care products, such as soap, body wash, shampoo, dental hygiene and foot care products); pet (such as pet supplies and pet food); and tobacco products.
Seasonal products include decorations, toys, batteries, small electronics, greeting cards, stationery, prepaid phones and accessories, gardening supplies, hardware, automotive and home office supplies.
Home products include kitchen supplies, cookware, small appliances, light bulbs, storage containers, frames, candles, craft supplies and kitchen, bed and bath soft goods.
3 Apparel includes casual everyday apparel for infants, toddlers, girls, boys, women and men, as well as socks, underwear, disposable diapers, shoes and accessories.
The percentage of net sales of each of our four categories of merchandise for the fiscal years indicated below was as follows: 2015 2014 2013 Consumables 75.9 % 75.7 % 75.2 % Seasonal 12.4 % 12.4 % 12.9 % Home products 6.3 % 6.4 % 6.4 % Apparel 5.4 % 5.5 % 5.5 % Our seasonal and home products categories typically account for the highest gross profit margins, and the consumables category typically accounts for the lowest gross profit margin.
The Dollar General Store The typical Dollar General store is operated by a store manager, one or more assistant store managers, and three or more sales associates. Our stores generally feature a low-cost, no frills building with limited maintenance capital, low operating costs, and a focused merchandise offering within a broad range of categories, allowing us to deliver low retail prices while generating strong cash flows and investment returns. Our stores average approximately 7,400 square feet of selling space and approximately 70% of our stores are located in towns of 20,000 or fewer people. We generally have had good success in locating suitable store sites in the past, and we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets. In addition, we believe we have significant opportunities available for our relocation and remodel programs.
Our store growth over the past three years is summarized in the following table: Year Stores at Beginning of Year Stores Opened Stores Closed Net Store Increase Stores at End of Year 2013 10,506 650 24 626 11,132 2014 11,132 700 43 657 11,789 2015 11,789 730 36 694 12,483 Our Customers Our customers seek value and convenience. Depending on their financial situation and geographic proximity, customers' reliance on Dollar General varies from fill-in shopping, to making periodic trips to stock up on household items, to making weekly or more frequent trips to meet most essential needs. We generally locate our stores and plan our merchandise selections to best serve the needs of our core customers, the low and fixed income households often underserved by other retailers, and we are focused on helping them make the most of their spending dollars. At the same time, however, loyal Dollar General shoppers from a wide range of income brackets and life stages appreciate our quality merchandise as well as our attractive value and convenience proposition.
Our Suppliers We purchase merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers and maintain direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand merchandise. Despite our broad offering, we maintain only a limited number of items per category, giving us a pricing advantage in dealing with our suppliers. Our largest and second largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 7% of our purchases in 2015.
4 Our private brands come from a diversified supplier base. We directly imported approximately 6% of our purchases at cost in 2015.
We have consistently managed to obtain sufficient quantities of core merchandise and believe that, if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable, we would generally be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of our business. However, such alternative sources could increase our merchandise costs or reduce the quality of our merchandise, and an inability to obtain alternative sources could adversely affect our sales.
Distribution and Transportation Our stores are currently supported by thirteen distribution centers located strategically throughout our geographic footprint. We recently broke ground on our fourteenth distribution center in Wisconsin. We lease additional temporary warehouse space as necessary to support our distribution needs. We continually analyze and rebalance the network to ensure that it remains efficient and provides the service our stores require. See "Properties" for additional information pertaining to our distribution centers.
Most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers and is delivered to our stores by third-party trucking firms, utilizing our trailers. In addition, vendors or third-party distributors ship certain food items and other merchandise directly to our stores.
Seasonality Our business is seasonal to a certain extent. Generally, our highest sales volume occurs in the fourth quarter, which includes the Christmas selling season, and the lowest occurs in the first quarter. In addition, our quarterly results can be affected by the timing of certain holidays, the timing of new store openings and store closings, and the amount of sales contributed by new and existing stores. We typically purchase substantial amounts of inventory in the third quarter and incur higher shipping and payroll costs in anticipation of increased sales activity during the fourth quarter. See Note14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Our Competition We operate in the basic discount consumer goods market, which is highly competitive with respect to price, store location, merchandise quality, assortment and presentation, in-stock consistency, and customer service. We compete with discount stores and with many other retailers, including mass merchandise, warehouse club, grocery, drug, convenience, variety and other specialty stores. These other retail companies operate stores in many of the areas where we operate, and many of them engage in extensive advertising and marketing efforts. Our direct competitors include Family Dollar, Dollar Tree, Fred's, 99 Cents Only and various local, independent operators, as well as Walmart, Target, Kroger, Aldi, Walgreens, CVS, and Rite Aid, among others. Certain of our competitors have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do.
We differentiate ourselves from other forms of retailing by offering consistently low prices in a convenient, small-store format. We believe that our prices are competitive due in part to our low-cost operating structure and the relatively limited assortment of products offered. Purchasing large volumes of merchandise within our focused assortment in each merchandise category allows us to keep our average costs low, contributing to our ability to offer competitive everyday low prices to our customers. See "Our Business Model" above for further discussion of our competitive situation.
5 Our Employees As of February26, 2016, we employed approximately 113,400 full-time and part-time employees, including divisional and regional managers, district managers, store managers, other store personnel and distribution center and administrative personnel. We have increasingly focused on recruiting, training, motivating and retaining employees, and we believe that the quality, performance and morale of our employees have increased as a result. We currently are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.

6 ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the SEC, including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. These risks are not the only risks we face. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity could also be adversely affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally or by risks not currently known to us or that we currently view to be immaterial. We can provide no assurance and make no representation that our risk mitigation efforts, although we believe they are reasonable, will be successful.
Economic conditions and other economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance and other aspects of our business by negatively impacting our customers' disposable income or discretionary spending, increasing our costs of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses, and adversely affecting our sales or profitability.
We believe many of our customers have fixed or low incomes and generally have limited discretionary spending dollars. Any factor that could adversely affect that disposable income would decrease our customers' spending and could cause our customers to shift their spending to products other than those sold by us or to our less profitable product choices, all of which could result in lower net sales, decreases in inventory turnover, greater markdowns on inventory, a change in the mix of products we sell, and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins. Factors that could reduce our customers' disposable income and over which we exercise no influence include but are not limited to adverse economic conditions such as increased or sustained high unemployment or underemployment levels, inflation, increases in fuel or other energy costs and interest rates, lack of available credit, consumer debt levels, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, concerns over government mandated participation in health insurance programs and increasing healthcare costs, and decreases in government subsidies such as unemployment and food assistance programs.
Many of the factors identified above that affect disposable income, as well as commodity rates, transportation costs (including the costs of diesel fuel), costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, lease costs, measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors, also affect our cost of goods sold and our selling, general and administrative expenses, and may have other adverse consequences which we are unable to fully anticipate or control, all of which may adversely affect our sales or profitability. We have limited or no ability to control many of these factors.
Our plans depend significantly on strategies and initiatives designed to increase sales and improve the efficiencies, costs and effectiveness of our operations, and failure to achieve or sustain these plans could affect our performance adversely.
We have strategies and initiatives (such as those relating to merchandising, sourcing, shrink, private brand, distribution and transportation, store operations, store formats, budgeting and expense reduction, and real estate) in various stages of testing, evaluation, and implementation, upon which we expect to rely to continue to improve our results of operations and financial condition and to achieve our financial plans. These initiatives are inherently risky and uncertain, even when tested successfully, in their application to our business in general. It is possible that successful testing can result partially from resources and attention that cannot be duplicated in broader implementation, particularly in light of the diverse geographic locations of our stores and the decentralized nature of our field management. General implementation also may be negatively affected by other risk factors described herein. Successful systemwide implementation relies on consistency of training, stability of workforce, ease of execution, and the absence of offsetting factors that can influence results adversely. Failure to achieve 7 successful implementation of our initiatives or the cost of these initiatives exceeding management's estimates could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The success of our merchandising initiatives, particularly those with respect to non-consumable merchandise and store-specific products and allocations, depends in part upon our ability to predict consistently and successfully the products that our customers will demand and to identify and timely respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences, expectations and needs. If we are unable to select products that are attractive to customers, to timely obtain such products at costs that allow us to sell them at an acceptable profit, or to effectively market such products, our sales, market share and profitability could be adversely affected. If our merchandising efforts in the non-consumables area or the higher margin areas within consumables are unsuccessful, we could be further adversely affected by our inability to offset the lower margins associated with our consumables business. Further, our merchandising efforts in the consumables area, including tobacco products, may not generate the net sales growth and increase customer traffic to the levels needed to offset the lower margins generated by sales of consumables and maintain our targeted gross profit margins.
If we cannot open, relocate or remodel stores profitably and on schedule, our planned future growth will be impeded, which would adversely affect sales.
Our ability to open, relocate and remodel profitable stores is a key component of our planned future growth. Our ability to timely open stores and to expand into additional market areas depends in part on the following factors: the availability of attractive store locations; the absence of entitlement process or occupancy delays; the ability to negotiate acceptable lease and development terms; the ability to hire and train new personnel, especially store managers, in a cost effective manner; the ability to identify customer demand in different geographic areas; general economic conditions; and the availability of capital funding for expansion. Many of these factors also affect our ability to successfully relocate stores, and many of them are beyond our control.
Delays or failures in opening new stores or completing relocations or remodels, or achieving lower than expected sales in these projects, could materially adversely affect our growth and/or profitability. We also may not anticipate all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of our operations and, as a result, may not meet our targets for opening new stores, remodeling or relocating stores or expanding profitably.
Some new stores and future new store opportunities may be located in areas, including but not limited to new states or metro urban areas, where we have limited or no meaningful experience or brand recognition. Those areas may have different competitive and market conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets, as well as higher cost of entry. These factors may cause our new stores to be initially less successful than stores in our existing markets, which could slow future growth in these areas.
Many new stores will be located in areas where we have existing stores. Although we have experience in these areas, increasing the number of locations in these markets may result in inadvertent oversaturation and temporarily or permanently divert customers and sales from our existing stores, thereby adversely affecting our overall financial performance.
Our profitability may be negatively affected by inventory shrinkage.
We are subject to the risk of inventory loss and theft. We experience significant inventory shrinkage and cannot be sure that incidences of inventory loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce the problem of inventory shrinkage. Although some level of inventory shrinkage is an unavoidable cost of doing business, if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage or incur increased security or other costs to combat inventory theft, our results of operations and financial condition could be affected adversely.
8 We face intense competition that could limit our growth opportunities and adversely impact our financial performance.
The retail business is highly competitive with respect to price, store location, merchandise quality, assortment and presentation, in-stock consistency, customer service, aggressive promotional activity, customers, and employees. We compete with discount stores and with many other retailers, including mass merchandise, warehouse club, grocery, drug, convenience, variety and other specialty stores. This competitive environment subjects us to the risk of adverse impact to our financial performance because of the lower prices, and thus the lower margins, that may be required to maintain our competitive position. Also, companies like ours, due to customer demographics and other factors, may have limited ability to increase prices in response to increased costs without losing competitive position. This limitation may adversely affect our margins and financial performance. Certain of our competitors have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to secure better arrangements with suppliers than we can. If we fail to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets, it could adversely affect our financial performance.
Competition for customers has intensified as competitors have moved into, or increased their presence in, our geographic markets and from the use of mobile and web-based technology that facilitates online shopping and real-time product and price comparisons. We expect this competition to continue to increase. We remain vulnerable to the marketing power and high level of consumer recognition of larger competitors and to the risk that these competitors or others could venture into our industry in a significant way, including through the introduction of new store formats. Further, consolidation within the discount retail industry could significantly alter the competitive dynamics of the retail marketplace. This consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions, as well as result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by these consolidated companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance.
Our private brands may not maintain broad market acceptance and may increase the risks we face.
The sale of private brand items is an important component of our sales growth and gross profit rate enhancement plans. We have invested in our development and procurement resources and marketing efforts relating to these private brand offerings. We believe that our success in maintaining broad market acceptance of our private brands depends on many factors, including pricing, our costs, quality and customer perception. We may not achieve or maintain our expected sales for our private brands. The sale and expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to certain risks, such as: potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls; our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties; our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and legal and regulatory requirements; and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail. An increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors' products, which, in turn, could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors. Any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could have a significant adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
A significant disruption to our distribution network, to the capacity of our distribution centers or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs, which would decrease our profits.
We rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores in a timely and cost-effective manner. Using various modes of transportation, including ocean, rail, and truck, we and our vendors move goods from vendor locations to our distribution centers. Deliveries to our stores occur from our distribution centers or directly from our vendors. Any disruption, unanticipated or 9 unusual expense or operational failure related to this process could affect store operations negatively. For example, delivery delays or increases in transportation costs (including through increased fuel costs, increased carrier rates or driver wages as a result of driver shortages, a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments, or work stoppages or slowdowns) could significantly decrease our ability to make sales and earn profits. Labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or long-term disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries or which would necessitate our securing alternative labor or shipping suppliers could also increase our costs or otherwise negatively affect our business.
We maintain a network of distribution facilities and are moving forward with plans to build new facilities to support our growth objectives. Delays in opening distribution centers could adversely affect our future financial performance by slowing store growth, which may in turn reduce revenue growth, or by increasing transportation costs. In addition, distribution-related construction or expansion projects entail risks that could cause delays and cost overruns, such as: shortages of materials or skilled labor; work stoppages; unforeseen construction, scheduling, engineering, environmental or geological problems; weather interference; fires or other casualty losses; and unanticipated cost increases. The completion date and ultimate cost of these projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to construction-related or other reasons. We cannot guarantee that any project will be completed on time or within established budgets.
Risks associated with or faced by our suppliers could adversely affect our financial performance.
The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, and we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner. In 2015, our largest and second largest suppliers each accounted for 7% of our purchases. We have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of core merchandise and believe that, if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable, we would generally be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of our business. However, such alternative sources could increase our merchandise costs, result in a temporary reduction in store inventory levels, and reduce the quality of our merchandise, and an inability to obtain alternative sources could adversely affect our sales. Additionally, if a supplier fails to deliver on its commitments, whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons, we could experience merchandise out-of-stocks that could lead to lost sales and damage to our reputation.
We directly imported approximately 6% of our purchases (measured at cost) in 2015, but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products. Changes to the prices and flow of these goods for any reason, such as political unrest or acts of war, currency fluctuations, disruptions in maritime lanes, port labor disputes, and economic conditions and instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our standards, issues with labor practices of our suppliers or labor problems they may experience (such as strikes, stoppages or slowdowns, which could also increase labor costs during and following the disruption), the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers, increased import duties, merchandise quality or safety issues, transport availability and cost, increases in wage rates and taxes, transport security, inflation, and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import, are beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and profitability. While we are working to reduce our dependency on goods produced in China, a substantial amount of our imported merchandise still comes from China, and thus, a change in the Chinese leadership, economic and market conditions, internal economic stimulus actions, or currency or other policies, as well as increases in costs of labor and wage taxes, could negatively impact our merchandise costs. In addition, the United States' foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and 10 other factors relating to foreign trade and port labor agreements are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our business and financial performance. As we increase our imports of merchandise from foreign vendors, the risks associated with these imports also will increase, and we may be exposed to additional or different risks as we increase imports of goods produced in countries other than China.
Product liability and food safety claims could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial performance.
Despite our best efforts to ensure the quality, safety and freshness of the products that we sell in all of our stores, we may be subject to product liability claims from customers or actions required or penalties assessed by government agencies relating to products, including but not limited to food products that are recalled, defective or otherwise alleged to be harmful. Such claims may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling and transportation phases.
All of our vendors and their products must comply with applicable product and food safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all applicable safety standards. We seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our suppliers. If we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available, such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to obtain indemnification from foreign suppliers may be hindered by the manufacturers' lack of understanding of U.S. product liability or other laws, which may result in our having to respond to claims or complaints from customers as if we were the manufacturer. Even with adequate insurance and indemnification, such claims could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in our products. Our litigation expenses could increase as well, which also could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued.
We are subject to governmental regulations, procedures and requirements. A significant change in, or noncompliance with, these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.
Our business is subject to numerous and increasing federal, state and local laws and regulations. We routinely incur significant costs in complying with these regulations. The complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are increasing due to expanding and additional legal and regulatory requirements and increased enforcement efforts. New laws or regulations, particularly those dealing with environmental compliance, product safety, food safety, information security and privacy, and labor and employment, among others, or changes in existing laws and regulations, particularly those governing the sale of products or employee wages, may result in significant added expenses or may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement and/or could materially increase our cost of doing business. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations or untimely or incomplete execution of a required product recall, can result in the imposition of penalties, including loss of licenses or significant fines or monetary penalties, class action litigation or other litigation, in addition to reputational damage. Additionally, changes in tax laws, the interpretation of existing laws, or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate.
Litigation may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, consumers, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies and others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. Nationally, the number of employment-related class 11 actions filed each year has continued to increase, and recent changes and proposed changes in federal and state laws, regulations and agency guidance may cause claims to rise even more. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, regulatory actions and intellectual property claims, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See Note8 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding certain of these pending matters.
Natural disasters (whether or not caused by climate change), unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts, and global political events could disrupt business and result in lower sales and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance.
The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes and earthquakes, unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts or disruptive global political events, such as civil unrest in countries in which our suppliers are located, or similar disruptions could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns, which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our short-term results of operations. To the extent these events result in the closure of one or more of our distribution centers, a significant number of stores, or our corporate headquarters or impact one or more of our key suppliers, our operations and financial performance could be materially adversely affected through an inability to make deliveries or provide other support functions to our stores and through lost sales. In addition, these events could result in increases in fuel (or other energy) prices or a fuel shortage, delays in opening new stores, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some domestic and overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores, the inability of customers to reach or have transportation to our stores directly affected by such events, the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores and disruption of our utility services or to our information systems. These events also can have indirect consequences such as increases in the costs of insurance if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage.
Material damage or interruptions to our information systems as a result of external factors, staffing shortages or challenges or difficulties in maintaining or updating our existing technology or developing or implementing new technology could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
We depend on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business and are continually improving our information processes and computer systems to better run our business. These technology initiatives may not deliver desired results or may do so on a delayed schedule. Additionally, such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cybersecurity breaches, natural disasters and human error. Damage or interruption to these systems may require a significant investment to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim, may experience loss or corruption of critical data and may receive negative publicity, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
12 We also rely heavily on our information technology staff. Failure to meet these staffing needs may negatively affect our ability to fulfill our technology initiatives while continuing to provide maintenance on existing systems. We rely on certain vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business. The software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers. The inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner. In addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations.
Failure to attract, train and retain qualified employees while controlling labor costs, as well as other labor issues, could adversely affect our financial performance.
Our future growth and performance and positive customer experience depends on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate qualified employees, many of whom are in positions with historically high rates of turnover. Our ability to meet our labor needs, while controlling our labor costs, is subject to many external factors, including competition for and availability of qualified personnel in a given market, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage laws, health and other insurance costs, changes in employment and labor laws (including changes in the process for our employees to join a union) or other workplace regulations (including changes in "entitlement" programs such as health insurance and paid leave programs), and our reputation and relevance within the labor market. If we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified employees, our operations, customer service levels and support functions could suffer. To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, or attempts to unionize, our labor costs could increase. In addition, anticipated regulatory changes relating to the overtime exemptions under the Fair Labor Standards Act could result in increased labor costs to our business and negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required. Our ability to pass along labor costs to our customers is constrained by our everyday low price model, and we may not be able to offset the costs elsewhere in our business.
Our success depends on our executive officers and other key personnel. If we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our business may be harmed.
Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel. The unexpected loss of the services of any of our executive officers could have an adverse effect on our operations. There can be no assurance that our executive succession planning, retention or hiring efforts will be successful. Competition for skilled and experienced management personnel is intense, and our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, and a failure to attract and retain new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations. We do not currently maintain key person life insurance policies with respect to our executive officers or key personnel.
Our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances.
Our inventory balance represented approximately 54% of our total assets exclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets as of January29, 2016. Efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability. To be successful, we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate product mix to meet our customers' demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs to store and hold the goods unduly impacts our financial results or that subjects us to the risk of increased inventory shrinkage. If our buying decisions do not accurately 13 predict customer trends, we inappropriately price products or our expectations about customer spending levels are inaccurate, we may have to take unanticipated markdowns to dispose of the excess inventory, which also can adversely impact our financial results. We continue to focus on ways to reduce these risks, but we cannot make assurances that we will be successful in our inventory management. If we are not successful in managing our inventory balances, our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected.
Because our business is seasonal to a certain extent, with the highest volume of net sales during the fourth quarter, adverse events during the fourth quarter could materially affect our financial statements as a whole.
We generally recognize our highest volume of net sales during the Christmas selling season, which occurs in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. In anticipation of this holiday, we purchase substantial amounts of seasonal inventory. Adverse events, such as deteriorating economic conditions, high unemployment, high gas prices, public transportation disruptions, or unusual or unanticipated adverse weather could result in lower-than-planned sales during the holiday season. An excess of seasonal merchandise inventory could result if our net sales during the Christmas selling season fall below seasonal norms or expectations. If our fourth quarter sales results were substantially below expectations, our financial performance and operating results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdowns, especially in seasonal merchandise.
Our current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our financial performance.
Our insurance coverage reflects deductibles, self-insured retentions, limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on the dispersion of our operations. However, there are types of losses we may incur but against which we cannot be insured or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to acts of war, employee and certain other crime, certain wage and hour and other employment-related claims, including class actions, and some natural disasters. If we incur these losses and they are material, our business could suffer. Certain material events may result in sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely impact the availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases. To offset negative insurance market trends, we may elect to self-insure, accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage in response to these market changes. In addition, we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers' compensation, automobile liability, general liability and group health insurance programs. Unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses, including expected increases in medical and indemnity costs, could result in materially different expenses than expected under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Although we continue to maintain property insurance for catastrophic events at our store support center and distribution centers, we are effectively self-insured for other property losses. If we experience a greater number of these losses than we anticipate, our financial performance could be adversely affected.
Any failure to maintain the security of information we hold relating to our customers, employees and vendors, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, could expose us to litigation, government enforcement actions and costly response measures, and could materially disrupt our operations and harm our reputation and sales.
In connection with sales, we transmit confidential credit and debit card information. We also have access to, collect or maintain certain private or confidential information regarding our customers, employees and vendors, as well as our business. Additionally, under certain circumstances, we may 14 share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business (for example, third-party vendors assist us in the transmittal of credit and debit card information in connection with sales), as required by law, or with the permission of the individual. While we have implemented procedures and technology intended to protect and safeguard our information and require appropriate controls of our vendors, it is possible that computer hackers and others might compromise our security measures or those of our technology and other vendors in the future and obtain the personal information of our customers, employees and vendors that we hold or our business information, as cyberattacks are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated. Moreover, employee error or malfeasance or other irregularities may result in a defeat of our or our third-party vendors' security measures and breach our or our third-party vendors' information systems.
Because we accept debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards ("PCI DSS"), issued by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. PCI DSS contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing, and transmission of cardholder data. Additionally, we have implemented technology in all of our stores to allow for the acceptance of Europay, Mastercard and Visa (EMV) credit transactions. Complying with PCI DSS standards and implementing related procedures, technology and information security measures require significant resources and ongoing attention. However, even as we comply with PCI DSS standards and offer EMVtechnology in our stores, we may be vulnerable to, and unable to detect and appropriately respond to, data security breaches and data loss, including cybersecurity attacks or other breach of cardholder data.
A security breach of any kind (whether experienced by us or one of our vendors), which could be undetected for a period of time, or any failure by us to comply with the applicable privacy and information security laws, regulations and standards could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation, government enforcement actions, fines or penalties, and costly response measures (including, for example, providing notification to, and credit monitoring services for, affected customers, as well as further upgrades to our security measures) which may not be covered by or may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies, and could materially disrupt our operations. Any resulting negative media attention and publicity could significantly harm our reputation which could cause us to lose market share as a result of customers discontinuing the use of debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.
Deterioration in market conditions or changes in our credit profile could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition.
We rely on the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to the credit and capital markets to fund our operations, growth strategy, and return of cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of future liquidity. Our continued access to these liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors, including our operating performance and our credit ratings. Our debt securities currently have an investment grade rating, and a downgrade of this rating likely would negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing. As a result, any disruptions or turmoil in the debt markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition and our ability to return cash to our shareholders. There can be no assurances that our ability to obtain additional financing through the debt markets will not be adversely impacted by economic conditions or that we will be able to maintain or improve our current credit ratings.
15 New accounting guidance or changes in the interpretation or application of existing accounting guidance could adversely affect our financial performance.
The implementation of new accounting standards will require extensive systems, internal process and other changes that could increase our operating costs, and also will result in changes to our financial statements. In particular, the implementation of accounting standards related to leases, as recently issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board are expected to require us to make significant changes to our lease management, fixed asset, and other accounting systems, and will result in significant changes to our financial statements.
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance. The outcome of such changes could include litigation or regulatory actions which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

23 ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis should be read with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto. It also should be read in conjunction with the Cautionary Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and the Risk Factors disclosures set forth in the Introduction and in Item1A of this report, respectively.
Executive Overview We are among the largest discount retailers in the United States by number of stores, with 12,575 stores located in 43 states as of February26, 2016, with the greatest concentration of stores in the southern, southwestern, midwestern and eastern United States. We offer a broad selection of merchandise, including consumable products such as food, paper and cleaning products, health and beauty products and pet supplies, and non-consumable products such as seasonal merchandise, home decor and domestics, and basic apparel. Our merchandise includes high-quality national brands from leading manufacturers, as well as comparable quality and value private brand selections with prices at substantial discounts to national brands. We offer our customers these national brand and private brand products at everyday low prices (typically $10 or less) in our convenient small-box locations, with selling space averaging approximately 7,400 square feet per store.
Because the customers we serve are value-conscious, many with low or fixed incomes, we have always been intensely focused on helping them make the most of their spending dollars. We believe our convenient store format and broad selection of high-quality products at compelling values have driven our substantial growth and financial success over the years. Like other retailers, we have been operating for several years in an environment with ongoing macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties. Our core customers are often the first to be affected by negative or uncertain economic conditions such as unemployment and fluctuating food, energy and medical costs, and the last to feel the effects of improving economic conditions. Our customer has experienced both positive and negative general economic factors during 2015, such as lower gasoline prices and unemployment rates coupled with rising rents and medical costs. The overall financial impact of these factors to our customers has been inconsistent and their duration is unknown.
Our operating priorities continue to evolve as we consistently strive to improve our performance while retaining our customer-centric focus. We are keenly focused on executing the following priorities: 1)driving profitable sales growth, 2)capturing growth opportunities, 3)enhancing our position as a low-cost operator, and 4)investing in our people as a competitive advantage.
We seek to drive profitable sales growth through initiatives such as improvement in our in-stock position, as well as an ongoing focus on enhancing our margins while maintaining both everyday low price and affordability.
Our in-stock improvement initiative is designed to ensure the right products are available on the shelf when our customers shop in our stores. To support this initiative and improve overall customer satisfaction, we are selectively investing incremental labor hours in those stores where we believe such increases will generate positive financial returns. As of the end of 2015, this retail labor hour investment had been implemented across over 3,100 stores. We have a disciplined approach to this labor investment and are able to quickly evaluate whether it delivers on our profitability expectations, reallocating resources as necessary.
We demonstrate our commitment to the affordability needs of our core customer by pricing more than 75% of our stock-keeping units at $5 or less as of the end of 2015. However, as we work to provide everyday low prices and meet our customers' affordability needs, we also remain focused on enhancing our margins through effective category management, inventory shrink reduction initiatives, private brands penetration, efforts to improve distribution and 24 transportation efficiencies, global sourcing, and pricing and markdown optimization. With respect to category management, the mix of sales affects profitability because the gross margin associated with sales within our consumables category generally is lower than that associated with sales within our non-consumables categories. Even within each category, however, there are varying levels of gross margin associated with the specific items. With respect to inventory shrink reduction, the progress in 2015 was broad-based with shrink declining across all four product categories. For a discussion of the sales mix, as well as the results of certain other margin-related initiatives in 2015, see "Results of Operations" below.
The degree of success of these initiatives is often reflected in our same-store sales results and in the level of improvement in shopper frequency and number of items sold and average transaction amount. For the 2015 fourth quarter, we believe these ongoing initiatives helped to drive the same-store sales growth in three out of our four product categories, reflecting increases in both customer traffic and average transaction amount for the 32 nd consecutive quarter when compared to the prior year quarter.
To support our other operating priorities we also are focused on capturing growth opportunities and innovating within our channel. We continued to expand our store count, opening 730 stores during 2015. We also have continued our store remodeling efforts and remodeled or relocated a total of 881stores during 2015. In fiscal 2016, we have plans to open 900 stores and to relocate or remodel 875stores, and we plan to maintain our accelerated square footage growth of approximately six to eight percent during 2017. We continue to innovate within our channel, and during 2016 we will implement the DG16 store format. This store format will include additional cooler doors, a redesigned queueing area, and other enhancements that are focused on meeting the evolving demands of our core customer while also delivering on our operating priorities. In addition, we are testing a smaller format store (less than 6,000 square feet) which we believe could allow us to capture growth opportunities in metropolitan areas.
We have established a position as a low-cost operator, continuously seeking ways to control costs that do not affect our customer's shopping experience. We have enhanced this position during the latter part of 2015 and into 2016 through our zero-based budgeting initiative, streamlining our business while also reducing expenses. Our goal is to lower the same-store sales growth required to leverage selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses. As part of this initiative we reduced approximately 255positions within our corporate support function in the third quarter of 2015 and expect to reinvest a portion of these savings in the business as we deem appropriate. In addition, at the store level, we remain committed to simplifying or eliminating various tasks so that those time savings can be reinvested by our store managers in other areas such as ensuring customer service, improved in-stock levels, and improved store standards. We will continue to seek additional opportunities to enhance our low-cost position.
Our employees are a competitive advantage, and we are always searching for ways to continue investing in them. Our training programs are continually evolving, as we work to ensure that our employees have the tools necessary to be successful in their positions. We invest in our employees in an effort to create an environment that attracts and retains talented personnel, as we believe that, particularly at the store level, employees who are promoted from within generally have longer tenures and are greater contributors to improvements in our financial performance. Furthermore, we believe that reducing our store manager turnover likely results in improved store financial performance in areas such as shrink and sales. We have also implemented training programs for high-potential employees, and believe that these and other efforts will produce a more stable, engaged workforce.
Our continued focus on these four operating priorities, coupled with strong cash flow management and share repurchases resulted in solid overall operating and financial performance in 2015 as compared to 2014 as follows. Basis points, as referred to below, are equal to 0.01percent of net sales.
Net sales in 2015 increased 7.7% over 2014. Sales in same-stores increased 2.8%, with increases in both customer traffic and average transaction amount. Consumables represented 76% of sales 25 in 2015. Departments with the most significant increases in net sales were candy and snacks, perishables, tobacco, and food. Average sales per square foot in 2015 were $226, up from $223 in 2014.
Operating profit increased 9.7% to $1.94billion, or 9.5% of sales, compared to $1.77billion, or 9.4% of sales in 2014. The increase in our operating profit rate was attributable to a 27 basis-point increase in our gross profit rate, which was partially offset by a 10 basis-point increase in SG&A.
Our gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points due primarily to lower transportation costs and a lower rate of inventory shrinkage.
The increase in SG&A, as a percentage of sales, was due primarily to increases in incentive compensation expense, repairs and maintenance expense and occupancy costs. For other factors, see the detailed discussion that follows.
Interest expense decreased by $1.3million in 2015 to $86.9million. Total long-term obligations as of January29, 2016 were $2.97billion.
We reported net income of $1.17billion, or $3.95 per diluted share, for 2015, compared to net income of $1.07billion, or $3.49 per diluted share, for 2014. Stock repurchase activity during 2014 and 2015 contributed to the increase in diluted earnings per share.
We generated approximately $1.38billion of cash flows from operating activities in 2015, an increase of 4.8% compared to 2014. We primarily utilized our cash flows from operating activities to invest in the growth of our business, repurchase our common stock, and pay quarterly cash dividends.
Inventory turnover was 4.7 times on a rolling four-quarter basis. Inventories increased 4.3% on a per store basis over 2014.
During 2015 we opened 730 new stores, remodeled or relocated 881 stores, and closed 36 stores.
Also in 2015, we repurchased approximately 17.6million shares of our outstanding common stock for $1.3billion.
In 2016, we plan to continue to focus on our four key operating priorities. We expect our sales growth in 2016 to again be driven primarily by consumables, although we expect non-consumables sales to continue to contribute to our profitable sales growth. Same-store sales growth is key to achieving our objectives, and we have implemented targeted actions to drive same-store sales in 2016, such as updating our customer segmentation to gain deeper insights into the spending habits for each of our core customer segments. This helps drive our category management process, as we optimize our assortment and expand into those categories that are most likely to drive traffic to our stores. Our continued focus on on-shelf availability and affordability also should assist in growing transactions and number of items sold. Our new store format will offer a total of 22 cooler doors, an increase of six cooler doors as compared to our previous new store format and will be utilized for all new stores, relocations and remodels.
Other key 2016 initiatives include our zero-based budgeting initiative, which we expect to take costs out of the business that do not affect the customer experience, ongoing supply chain improvements, and investing in our people. In addition, we plan to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock and pay quarterly cash dividends, subject to Board discretion, to further enhance shareholder return. However, we are facing potential regulatory changes relating to overtime exemptions under the Fair Labor Standards Act, which, if implemented, are expected to increase our labor costs and negatively affect our operating results.
Readers should refer to the detailed discussion of our operating results below for additional comments on financial performance in the current year periods as compared with the prior year periods.
26 Results of Operations Accounting Periods.
The following text contains references to years 2015, 2014, and 2013, which represent fiscal years ended January29, 2016, January30, 2015, and January31, 2014, respectively. Our fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to January31. All referenced fiscal years were 52-week accounting periods.
Seasonality.
The nature of our business is seasonal to a certain extent. Primarily because of sales of holiday-related merchandise, sales in our fourth quarter (November, December and January) have historically been higher than sales achieved in each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year. Expenses, and to a greater extent operating profit, vary by quarter. Results of a period shorter than a full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year. Furthermore, the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between periods. For more information about the seasonality of our business, see "Seasonality" included in Part1, Item1 of this report.
The following table contains results of operations data for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, and the dollar and percentage variances among those years.

The net sales increase in 2015 reflects a same-store sales increase of 2.8% compared to 2014. For 2015, there were 11,706 same-stores which accounted for sales of $19.25billion. Same-stores include stores that have been open for at least 13months and remain open at the end of the reporting period. Changes in same-store sales are calculated based on the comparable calendar weeks in the 27 prior year, and include stores that have been remodeled, expanded or relocated. The remainder of the increase in sales in 2015 was attributable to new stores, partially offset by sales from closed stores. The increase in sales reflects increased customer traffic and average transaction amounts. Increases in sales of consumables slightly outpaced our non-consumables, with sales of candy and snacks, perishables, tobacco products, and food contributing the majority of the increase in sales of consumables.
The net sales increase in 2014 reflects a same-store sales increase of 2.8% compared to 2013. For 2014, there were 11,052 same-stores which accounted for sales of $17.82billion. The remainder of the increase in sales in 2014 was attributable to new stores, partially offset by sales from closed stores. The increase in sales reflects increased customer traffic and average transaction amounts resulting from the refinement of the Company's merchandise offerings, including a full year's sales of tobacco products, the expansion of perishables, and enhanced utilization of store square footage. Increases in sales of consumables outpaced our non-consumables, with sales of tobacco products, perishables, and candy and snacks contributing the majority of the increase in sales of consumables.
Of our four major merchandise categories, the consumables category, which generally has a lower gross profit rate than the other three categories, has grown most significantly over the past several years. Because of the impact of sales mix on gross profit, we continually review our merchandise mix and strive to adjust it when appropriate.
Gross Profit.
The gross profit rate as a percentage of sales was 31.0% in 2015 compared to 30.7% in 2014. Gross profit increased by 8.7% in 2015, and as a percentage of sales, increased by 27 basis points. The gross profit rate increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily reflects lower transportation costs and an improved rate of inventory shrinkage, partially offset by increased markdowns. We recorded a LIFO benefit of $2.3million in 2015 compared to a LIFO provision of $4.2million in 2014.
The gross profit rate as a percentage of sales was 30.7% in 2014 compared to 31.1% in 2013. Gross profit increased by 6.7% in 2014, and as a percentage of sales, decreased by 36 basis points. The most significant factor affecting the gross profit rate was an increase in markdowns, primarily due to increased promotions driven by competitive pressures. In addition, we experienced a continued trend of consumables comprising a larger portion of our net sales, primarily as the result of increased sales of lower margin consumables including tobacco products and expanded perishables offerings. These factors were partially offset by higher initial inventory markups. We recorded a LIFO provision of $4.2million in 2014 compared to a LIFO benefit of $11.0million in 2013.
SG&A.
SG&A was 21.4% as a percentage of sales in 2015 compared to 21.3% in 2014, an increase of 10 basis points. The 2015 results reflect increases in incentive compensation expenses, repairs and maintenance expenses, occupancy costs, and fees associated with an increase in debit card transactions. Partially offsetting these items was a higher volume of cash back transactions resulting in increased convenience fees collected from customers. The 2014 results reflect expenses of $14.3million, or 8 basis points as a percentage of sales, related to an acquisition that was not completed.
SG&A expense was 21.3% as a percentage of sales in 2014 compared to 21.1% in 2013, an increase of 19 basis points. The 2014 results reflect a significant increase in incentive compensation expense, as our 2013 financial performance did not satisfy certain performance requirements under our cash incentive compensation program. The 2014 results also reflect increases in rent and utilities. Partially offsetting these increased costs were retail labor expense, which increased at a rate lower than our increase in sales, the introduction of convenience fees charged to customers for cash back on debit card transactions, and a reduction in workers' compensation and general liability expenses. The 2014 period included expenses of $14.3million relating to an acquisition that was not completed, while the 2013 results include expenses of $8.5million for a legal settlement of a previously decertified collective action.
28 Interest Expense.
Interest expense decreased $1.3million to $86.9million in 2015 compared to 2014. See the detailed discussion under "Liquidity and Capital Resources" regarding the financing of various long-term obligations.
Interest expense remained relatively constant in 2014 compared to 2013.
We had outstanding variable-rate debt of $686.6million and $62.0million as of January29, 2016 and January30, 2015, respectively, after taking into consideration the impact of interest rate swaps in effect at January30, 2015. The remainder of our outstanding indebtedness at January29, 2016 and January30, 2015 was fixed rate debt.
Other (Income) Expense.
In 2015, we recorded pretax losses of $0.3million related to the refinancing of long-term debt. In 2013, we recorded pretax losses of $18.9million resulting from the termination of our senior secured credit facilities.
Income Taxes.
The effective income tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were expenses of 37.1%, 36.6% and 37.0%, respectively.
The effective income tax rate for 2015 was 37.1% compared to a rate of 36.6% for 2014 which represents a net increase of 0.5percentage points. The effective income tax rate was lower in 2014 due principally to federal and state reserve releases in 2014 that did not reoccur, to the same extent, in 2015. As in prior years, we receive a significant income tax benefit related to wages paid to certain newly hired employees that qualify for federal jobs credits (principally the Work Opportunity Tax Credit or "WOTC"). In December 2015, Congress retroactively extended the federal law authorizing the WOTC for the period from January1, 2015 through December31, 2019. Accordingly, based on current law, the WOTC should be available for our 2016 through 2019 fiscal years.
The effective income tax rate for 2014 was 36.6% compared to a rate of 37.0% for 2013 which represents a net decrease of 0.4percentage points. The effective income tax rate decreased from 2013 due principally to the favorable resolution of state income tax examinations and other state income tax reserves, which increased by a lesser amount in 2014 compared to 2013.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The entities involved in the ownership structure underlying the leases for three of our distribution centers meet the accounting definition of a Variable Interest Entity ("VIE"). One of these distribution centers has been recorded as a financing obligation whereby its property and equipment are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. The land and buildings of the other two distribution centers have been recorded as operating leases. We are not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs and, accordingly, have not included these entities in our consolidated financial statements. Other than the foregoing, we are not party to any material off balance sheet arrangements.
Effects of Inflation We experienced little or no overall product cost inflation in 2015, 2014 and 2013.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Current Financial Condition and Recent Developments During the past three years, we have generated an aggregate of approximately $3.91billion in cash flows from operating activities and incurred approximately $1.42billion in capital expenditures. During that period, we expanded the number of stores we operate by 1,977, representing growth of approximately 19%, and we remodeled or relocated 2,378 stores, or approximately 19% of the stores we operated as of January29, 2016. We intend to continue our current strategy of pursuing store growth, remodels and relocations in 2016.
29 We have a five-year $1.425billion unsecured credit agreement (the "Facilities"), and we have outstanding $2.3billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. At January29, 2016, we had total outstanding debt (including the current portion of long-term obligations) of $2.97billion, which includes balances under the Facilities, and senior notes, all of which are described in greater detail below. We had $722.0million available for borrowing under the Facilities at January29, 2016. The information contained in Note5 to the consolidated financial statements under the heading "Borrowing Facilities and 2015 Refinancing" contained in PartII, Item8 of this report is incorporated herein by reference. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $421.9million in 2015, primarily due to the suspension of share repurchases during the portion of 2014 that coincided with our attempted acquisition, resulting in higher than normal cash and cash equivalents balances at the end of 2014.
We believe our cash flow from operations and existing cash balances, combined with availability under the Facilities as discussed in greater detail below and access to the debt markets will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected working capital requirements, capital spending and anticipated dividend payments for a period that includes the next twelve months as well as the next several years. However, our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity may be affected by numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control. Depending on our liquidity levels, conditions in the capital markets and other factors, we may from time to time consider the issuance of debt, equity or other securities, the proceeds of which could provide additional liquidity for our operations.
Facilities On October20, 2015, we consummated a refinancing pursuant to which we amended and restated our senior unsecured credit facilities. The Facilities consist of a $425.0million senior unsecured term loan facility (the "Term Facility") and a $1.0billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility") which provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to $175.0million. The Facilities are scheduled to mature on October20, 2020.
Borrowings under the Facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable interest rate margin plus, at our option, either (a)LIBOR or (b)a base rate (which is usually equal to the prime rate). The applicable interest rate margin for borrowings as of January29, 2016 was 1.10% for LIBOR borrowings and 0.10% for base-rate borrowings. We must also pay a facility fee, payable on any used and unused commitment amounts of the Facilities, and customary fees on letters of credit issued under the Revolving Facility. The applicable interest rate margins for borrowings, the facility fees and the letter of credit fees under the Facilities are subject to adjustment from time to time based on our long-term senior unsecured debt ratings. The weighted average all-in interest rate for borrowings under the Facilities was 1.65% as of January29, 2016.
The Facilities can be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty. There is no required amortization under the Facilities. The Facilities contain a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the Company's and its subsidiaries ability to: incur additional liens; sell all or substantially all of our assets; consummate certain fundamental changes or change in the Company's lines of business; and incur additional subsidiary indebtedness. The Facilities also contain financial covenants that require the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. As of January29, 2016, we were in compliance with all such covenants. The Facilities also contain customary events of default.
As of January29, 2016, under the Revolving Facility, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $251.0million, standby letters of credit of $27.0million, and borrowing availability of $722.0million. In addition, we had outstanding commercial letters of credit of $11.7million.
30 For the remainder of fiscal 2016, we anticipate potential borrowings under the Revolving Facility up to a maximum of approximately $500million outstanding at any one time, including any anticipated borrowings to fund repurchases of common stock.
Senior Notes On October20, 2015, we issued $500.0million aggregate principal amount of 4.150% senior notes due 2025 (the "2025 Senior Notes"), net of discount of $0.8million, which are scheduled to mature on November1, 2025. In addition, we have $500.0million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due 2017 (the "2017 Senior Notes") which are scheduled to mature on July15, 2017, $400.0million aggregate principal amount of 1.875% senior notes due 2018 (the "2018 Senior Notes"), net of discount of $0.2million, which are scheduled to mature on April15, 2018; and $900.0million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% senior notes due 2023 (the "2023 Senior Notes"), net of discount of $1.8million, which are scheduled to mature on April15, 2023. Collectively, the 2017 Senior Notes, the 2018 Senior Notes, the 2023 Senior Notes and the 2025 Senior Notes comprise the "Senior Notes", each of which were issued pursuant to an indenture as supplemented and amended by supplemental indentures relating to each series of Senior Notes (as so supplemented and amended, the "Senior Indenture"). Interest on the 2017 Senior Notes is payable in cash on January15 and July15 of each year. Interest on the 2018 Senior Notes and the 2023 Senior Notes is payable in cash on April15 and October15 of each year. Interest on the 2025 Senior Notes is payable in cash on May1 and November1 of each year, commencing on May1, 2016. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2025 Senior Notes were used, together with borrowings under the Facilities, to repay all outstanding borrowings under the then-existing credit agreement and for general corporate purposes.
We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time at redemption prices set forth in the Senior Indenture. Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, which is defined in the Senior Indenture, each holder of our Senior Notes has the right to require us to repurchase some or all of such holder's Senior Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
The Senior Indenture contains covenants limiting, among other things, our ability (subject to certain exceptions) to consolidate, merge, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee indebtedness secured by liens on any shares of voting stock of significant subsidiaries.
The Senior Indenture also provides for events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on our Senior Notes to become or to be declared due and payable, as applicable.
Sale Leaseback Transaction In January 2014 we consummated a transaction pursuant to which we sold and subsequently leased back the land, buildings and related improvements for 233 of our stores. This transaction resulted in cash proceeds of approximately $281.6million.
Rating Agencies In October 2015, Standard& Poor's raised our senior unsecured debt rating and our corporate debt rating to BBB, both with a stable outlook, and Moody's reaffirmed our senior unsecured debt rating of Baa3 and changed our outlook to positive. Our current credit ratings, as well as future rating agency actions, could (i)impact our ability to finance our operations on satisfactory terms; (ii)affect our financing costs; and (iii)affect our insurance premiums and collateral requirements necessary for our self-insured programs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our current credit ratings.
31 Interest Rate Swaps From time to time, we use interest rate swaps to minimize the risk of adverse changes in interest rates. These swaps are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of high correlation between the derivative financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged, fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure. Our principal interest rate exposure relates to outstanding amounts under our Facilities. On May31, 2015, interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $875.0million expired, and at January29, 2016, we had no outstanding interest rate swaps. For more information see Item7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" below.
Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of January29, 2016 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations Total > 1year 1 - 3years 3 - 5years 5+ years Long-term debt obligations $ 2,986,590 $ 215 $ 900,770 $ 677,080 $ 1,408,525 Capital lease obligations 4,806 1,164 1,412 920 1,310 Interest(a) 513,562 89,626 141,340 119,576 163,020 Self-insurance liabilities(b) 221,796 83,293 89,438 30,388 18,677 Operating lease obligations(c) 7,229,243 866,444 1,614,931 1,353,567 3,394,301                  Subtotal $ 10,955,997 $ 1,040,742 $ 2,747,891 $ 2,181,531 $ 4,985,833                  Commitments Expiring by Period Commercial commitments(d) Total >1year 1 - 3years 3 - 5years 5+ years Letters of credit $ 11,680 $ 11,680 $  $  $  Purchase obligations(e) 722,630 722,630                     Subtotal $ 734,310 $ 734,310 $  $  $                   Total contractual obligations and commercial commitments (f) $ 11,690,307 $ 1,775,052 $ 2,747,891 $ 2,181,531 $ 4,985,833                                                    (a) Represents obligations for interest payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations, and includes projected interest on variable rate long-term debt, using 2015year end rates and balances. Variable rate long-term debt includes the balance of the senior revolving credit facility (which had a balance of $251million as of January29, 2016), the balance of our tax increment financing of $10.6million, and the balance of the senior term loan facility of $425million.
(b) We retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers' compensation, employee health insurance, general liability, property loss and automobile insurance. As these obligations do not have scheduled maturities, these amounts represent undiscounted estimates based upon actuarial assumptions. Reserves for workers' compensation and general liability which existed as of the date of a merger transaction in 2007 were discounted in order to arrive at estimated fair value. All other amounts are reflected on an undiscounted basis in our consolidated balance sheets.
(c) Operating lease obligations are inclusive of amounts included in deferred rent in our consolidated balance sheets.
32 (d) Commercial commitments include information technology license and support agreements, supplies, fixtures, letters of credit for import merchandise, and other inventory purchase obligations.
(e) Purchase obligations include legally binding agreements for software licenses and support, supplies, fixtures, and merchandise purchases (excluding such purchases subject to letters of credit).
(f) We have potential payment obligations associated with uncertain tax positions that are not reflected in these totals. We are currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the taxing authorities for the $8.7million of reserves for uncertain tax positions.
Share Repurchase Program On December2, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a $1.0billion increase to our existing common stock repurchase program. Our common stock repurchase program had a total remaining authorization of approximately $924million at January29, 2016. Under the authorization, purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time subject to market and other conditions, and the authorization has no expiration date. For more detail about our share repurchase program, see Note12 to the consolidated financial statements.
Other Considerations On March8, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $0.25 per share which will be paid on April12, 2016 to shareholders of record on March29, 2016, an increase of $0.03 per share over quarterly dividends paid in 2015. Although the Board currently intends to continue regular quarterly cash dividends, the payment of future cash dividends are subject to the Board's discretion and will depend upon, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that our Board may deem relevant.
Our inventory balance represented approximately 54% of our total assets exclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets as of January29, 2016. Our ability to effectively manage our inventory balances can have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given fiscal year. Inventory purchases are often somewhat seasonal in nature, such as the purchase of warm-weather or Christmas-related merchandise. Efficient management of our inventory has been and continues to be an area of focus for us.
As described in Note8 to the consolidated financial statements, we are involved in a number of legal actions and claims, some of which could potentially result in material cash payments. Adverse developments in those actions could materially and adversely affect our liquidity. We also have certain income tax-related contingencies as disclosed in Note4 to the consolidated financial statements. Future negative developments could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.
Cash Flows Cash flows from operating activities.
Cash flows from operating activities were $1.38billion in 2015, an increase of $63.2million compared to 2014. Significant components of the increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 include increased net income due primarily to increased sales and operating profit in 2015 as described in more detail above under "Results of Operations." Changes in merchandise inventories resulted in a net use of working capital, increasing by a greater amount in 2015 compared to 2014 as described in greater detail below. Accounts payable increased by $105.6million in 2015 compared to a $97.2million increase in 2014, due primarily to the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments.
33 Cash flows from operating activities were $1.31billion in 2014, an increase of $101.7million compared to 2013. Significant components of the increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 include increased net income due primarily to increased sales and operating profit in 2014 as described in more detail above under "Results of Operations." Merchandise inventories increased by a greater amount in 2014 compared to 2013 as described in greater detail below, which was partially offset by accounts payable, which increased by $97.2million in 2014 compared to a $36.9million increase in 2013. The increase in accounts payable during 2014 was due primarily to the volume and timing of domestic merchandise receipts.
On an ongoing basis, we closely monitor and manage our inventory balances, and they may fluctuate from period to period based on new store openings, the timing of purchases, and other factors. Inventory balances at January29, 2016 were impacted by a new DC in Texas, the timing of the Easter holiday in 2016, and our in-stock improvement initiative. Merchandise inventories increased by 10% in 2015, by 9% in 2014, and by 7% in 2013. Inventory levels in the consumables category increased by $218.4million, or 13% in 2015, by $178.4million, or 12%, in 2014, and by $168.0million, or 12%, in 2013. The seasonal category increased by $63.2million, or 13%, in 2015, by $13.8million, or 3%, in 2014, and decreased by $4.7million, or 1%, in 2013. The home products category increased by $12.8million, or 5%, in 2015, was essentially unchanged in 2014, and increased by $22.0million, or 9%, in 2013. The apparel category decreased by $2.7million, or 1%, in 2015, increased by $37.1million, or 13%, in 2014, and decreased by $29.5million, or 9%, in 2013.
Cash flows from investing activities.
Significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2015 included the following approximate amounts: $168million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $144million for distribution and transportation-related projects; $99million for new leased stores; $53million for stores built by us; and $34million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects. The timing of new, remodeled and relocated store openings along with other factors may affect the relationship between such openings and the related property and equipment purchases in any given period. During 2015, we opened 730new stores and remodeled or relocated 881 stores.
Significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2014 included the following approximate amounts: $127million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $102million for new leased stores; $64million for distribution and transportation-related projects; $38million for stores built by us; and $35million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects. During 2014, we opened 700 new stores and remodeled or relocated 915stores. Cash flows from investing activities decreased from 2013 to 2014, due primarily to a sale-leaseback transaction in 2013 (more fully described below).
Significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2013 included the following approximate amounts: $187million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $124million for new leased stores; $112million for distribution centers, which included a significant portion of the construction cost of a distribution center in Pennsylvania; $76million for stores purchased or built by us; and $28million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects. During 2013, we opened 650 new stores and remodeled or relocated 582 stores. Our sale-leaseback transaction which we consummated in January 2014 for 233 of our stores resulted in proceeds from the sale of these properties of approximately $281.6million.
Capital expenditures during 2016 are projected to be in the range of $550-$600million. We anticipate funding 2016 capital requirements with existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, and we also expect to have significant availability under our Revolving Facility if necessary. We plan to continue to invest in store growth and development of approximately 900 new stores and approximately 875 stores to be remodeled or relocated. Capital expenditures in 2016 are anticipated to support our store growth as well as our remodel and relocation initiatives, including capital outlays for leasehold 34 improvements, fixtures and equipment; the construction of new stores; costs to support and enhance our supply chain initiatives including new and existing distribution center facilities; technology initiatives; as well as routine and ongoing capital requirements.
Cash flows from financing activities.
In 2015, we repurchased 17.6million outstanding shares of our common stock at a total cost of $1.3billion. We made repayments of $500.0million on the balance of the Term Facility, and had proceeds of $499.2million from the issuance of senior notes. Net borrowings under the Revolving Facility during 2015 were $251.0million.
In 2014, we repurchased 14.1million outstanding shares of our common stock at a total cost of $800.1million. We made repayments of $75.0million on the balance of the Term Facility. Borrowings and repayments under the Revolving Facility during the 2014 period were the same amount, resulting in no net increase to amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility during 2014.
The 2013 cash flows from financing activities reflect a refinancing in April 2013, including the issuance of long-term obligations which includes the $1.0billion unsecured Term Facility and the issuance of Senior Notes totaling approximately $1.3billion. Proceeds from these transactions were used to repay our previous secured term loan and revolving credit facilities which had balances of $1.96billion and $155.6million when refinanced. Net repayments under the Revolving Facility were $130.9million during 2013. We paid debt issuance costs and hedging fees totaling $29.2million in 2013 related to the refinancing. Also in 2013, we repurchased 11.0million outstanding shares of our common stock at a total cost of $620.1million.
Accounting Standards In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to lease accounting. This guidance requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee will account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability on its balance sheet, with differing methodology for income statement recognition. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective approach is required for all leases existing or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the consolidated financial statements. We are currently assessing the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements, and we are anticipating a material impact because of our significant volume of lease contracts.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("U.S.GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. In addition to the estimates presented below, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined below. We believe these estimates are reasonable and appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used, the resulting changes could have a material effect on the financial statements taken as a whole.
Management believes the following policies and estimates are critical because they involve significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates. Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below relating to those policies and estimates. See Note1 to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our principal accounting policies.
35 Merchandise Inventories.
Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market ("LCM") with cost determined using the retail last in, first out ("LIFO") method. We use the retail inventory method ("RIM") to calculate gross profit and the resulting valuation of inventories at cost, which are computed utilizing a calculated cost-to-retail inventory ratio at an inventory department level. We apply the RIM to these departments, which are groups of products that are fairly uniform in terms of cost, selling price relationship and turnover. The RIM will result in valuing inventories at LCM if permanent markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories. Inherent in the retail inventory method calculation are certain management judgments and estimates that may impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the gross profit recognized. These judgments include ensuring departments consist of uniform products, recording estimated shrinkage between physical inventories, and timely recording of markdowns needed to sell inventory.
We perform an annual LIFO analysis whereby all merchandise units are considered for inclusion in the index formulation. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. In contrast, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's annual estimates of sales and the rate of inflation or deflation, as well as year-end inventory levels. We also perform analyses for determining obsolete inventory, adjusting inventory on a quarterly basis to an LCM value based on various management assumptions including estimated below cost markdowns not yet recorded, but required to liquidate such inventory in future periods.
Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand based on changes in competitors' practices, consumer preferences, consumer spending and unseasonable weather patterns. Certain of these factors are outside of our control and may result in greater than estimated markdowns to entice consumer purchases of excess inventory. The amount and timing of markdowns may vary significantly from year to year.
We perform physical inventories in virtually all of our stores on an annual basis. We calculate our shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal period and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period. This accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales at each retail store, at a department level, based on the store's most recent historical shrink rate. To the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different results than the estimated accrual, our effective shrink rate for a given reporting period will include the impact of adjusting to the actual results.
We believe our estimates and assumptions related to the application of the RIM results in a merchandise inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost on a consistent basis.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
The qualitative and quantitative assessments related to the valuation and any potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets are each subject to judgments and/or assumptions. The analysis of qualitative factors may include determining the appropriate factors to consider and the relative importance of those factors along with other assumptions. If required, judgments in the quantitative testing process may include projecting future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates, correctly applying valuation techniques, correctly computing the implied fair value of goodwill if necessary, and other assumptions. Future cash flow projections are based on management's projections and represent best estimates taking into account recent financial performance, market trends, strategic plans and other available information, which in recent years have been materially accurate. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or impairment, however, such a conclusion is not indicated by recent analyses. Future indicators of impairment could result in an asset impairment charge. If these judgments or assumptions are incorrect or flawed, the analysis could be negatively impacted.
36 Our most recent testing of our goodwill and indefinite lived trade name intangible assets was completed during the third quarter of 2015. No indicators of impairment were evident and no assessment of or adjustment to these assets was required. We are not currently projecting a decline in cash flows that could be expected to have an adverse effect such as a violation of debt covenants or future impairment charges.
Property and Equipment.
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. We group our assets into relatively homogeneous classes and generally provide for depreciation on a straight-line basis over the estimated average useful life of each asset class, except for leasehold improvements, which are amortized over the lesser of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. Certain store and warehouse fixtures, when fully depreciated, are removed from the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of depreciable lives involves judgments and the use of estimates, which we believe have been materially accurate in recent years.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets.
Impairment of long-lived assets results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by the assets. Our estimate of undiscounted future store cash flows is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and are difficult to predict. If our estimates of future cash flows are not materially accurate, our impairment analysis could be impacted accordingly. If a long-lived asset is found to be impaired, the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset's estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated based primarily upon projected future cash flows (discounted at our credit adjusted risk-free rate) or other reasonable estimates of fair market value. Although not currently anticipated, changes in these estimates, assumptions or projections could materially affect the determination of fair value or impairment.
Insurance Liabilities.
We retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers' compensation, employee health, property loss, automobile and general liability. These represent significant costs primarily due to our large employee base and number of stores. Provisions are made for these liabilities on an undiscounted basis. Certain of these liabilities are based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed using actuarial methodologies based on historical claim trends, which have been and are anticipated to continue to be materially accurate. If future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns, or other unanticipated events affect the number and significance of future claims, we may be required to record additional expenses or expense reductions, which could be material to our future financial results.
Contingent LiabilitiesIncome Taxes.
Income tax reserves are determined using the methodology established by accounting standards relating to uncertainty in income taxes. These standards require companies to assess each income tax position taken using a two-step process. A determination is first made as to whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained, based upon the technical merits, upon examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria, the benefit recorded for the tax position equals the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the respective tax position. Uncertain tax positions require determinations and liabilities to be estimated based on provisions of the tax law which may be subject to change or varying interpretation. If our determinations and estimates prove to be inaccurate, the resulting adjustments could be material to our future financial results.
Contingent LiabilitiesLegal Matters.
We are subject to legal, regulatory and other proceedings and claims. We establish liabilities as appropriate for these claims and proceedings based upon the probability and estimability of losses and to fairly present, in conjunction with the disclosures of these matters in our financial statements and SEC filings, management's view of our exposure. We review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss, 37 which includes an analysis of whether such loss estimates are probable, reasonably possible, or remote. We re-evaluate these assessments on a quarterly basis or as new and significant information becomes available to determine whether a liability should be established or if any existing liability should be adjusted. The actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded liability. In addition, because it is not permissible under U.S.GAAP to establish a litigation liability until the loss is both probable and estimable, in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a liability prior to the actual incurrence of the loss (upon verdict and judgment at trial, for example, or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement).
Lease Accounting and Excess Facilities.
Many of our stores are subject to build-to-suit arrangements with landlords, which typically carry a primary lease term of up to 15years with multiple renewal options. We also have stores subject to shorter-term leases and many of these leases have renewal options. Certain of our stores have provisions for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of defined sales volume. We recognize contingent rental expense when the achievement of specified sales targets is considered probable. We record minimum rental expense on a straight-line basis over the base, non-cancelable lease term commencing on the date that we take physical possession of the property from the landlord, which normally includes a period prior to store opening to make necessary leasehold improvements and install store fixtures. When a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent, we recognize the related rent expense on a straight-line basis and record the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent. Tenant allowances, to the extent received, are recorded as deferred incentive rent and amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease. We reflect as a liability any difference between the calculated expense and the amounts actually paid. Improvements of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Share-Based Payments.
Our stock option awards are valued on an individual grant basis using the Black-Scholes-Merton closed form option pricing model. We believe that this model fairly estimates the value of our stock option awards. The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental in the valuation of stock options, which affects compensation expense related to these options. These assumptions include the term that the options are expected to be outstanding, the historical volatility of our stock price, applicable interest rates and the dividend yield of our stock. Other factors involving judgments that affect the expensing of share-based payments include estimated forfeiture rates of share-based awards. Historically, these estimates have been materially accurate; however, if our estimates differ materially from actual experience, we may be required to record additional expense or reductions of expense, which could be material to our future financial results.
Fair Value Measurements.
Accounting standards for the measurement of fair value of assets and liabilities establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level3 of the hierarchy). Therefore, Level3 inputs are typically based on an entity's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity, and thus require the use of significant judgment and estimates. Currently, we have no assets or liabilities that are valued based solely on Level3 inputs.
Our fair value measurements are primarily associated with our outstanding debt instruments. We use various valuation models in determining the values of these liabilities. We believe that in recent years these methodologies have produced materially accurate valuations.
38 ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Risk Management We are exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates, and to a lesser degree commodity prices. To minimize this risk, we may periodically use financial instruments, including derivatives. All derivative financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to approval by the Board of Directors. As a matter of policy, we do not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes, and any such derivative financial instruments are intended to be used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Our objective is to correlate derivative financial instruments and the underlying exposure being hedged, so that fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure.
Interest Rate Risk We manage our interest rate risk through the strategic use of fixed and variable interest rate debt and, from time to time, derivative financial instruments. Our principal interest rate exposure relates to outstanding amounts under our unsecured debt Facilities. As of January29, 2016, we had variable rate borrowings of $425million under our Term Facility and borrowings of $251million outstanding under our Revolving Facility. In order to mitigate a portion of the variable rate interest exposure under the Facilities, in prior years we have entered into various interest rate swaps. As of January29, 2016, no such interest rate swaps were outstanding and, as a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in variable interest rates under the Facilities. For a detailed discussion of our Facilities, see Note5 to the consolidated financial statements.
A change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax earnings and cash flows; whereas a change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts the economic fair value of debt but not our pre-tax earnings and cash flows. Based on our variable rate borrowing levels and interest rate swaps outstanding as of January29, 2016 and January30, 2015, the annualized effect of a one percentage point increase in variable interest rates would have resulted in a pretax reduction of our earnings and cash flows of approximately $6.9million in 2015 and $0.6million in 2014.
39 ITEM 8.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Dollar General Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dollar General Corporation and subsidiaries as of January29, 2016 and January30, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January29, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Dollar General Corporation and subsidiaries at January29, 2016 and January30, 2015, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January29, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Dollar General Corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of January29, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March22, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

45 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Basis of presentation and accounting policies Basis of presentation These notes contain references to the years 2015, 2014, and 2013, which represent fiscal years ended January29, 2016, January30, 2015, and January31, 2014, respectively, each of which were 52-week accounting periods. The Company's fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to January31. The consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries of the Company, except for its not-for-profit subsidiary which the Company does not control. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
The Company sells general merchandise on a retail basis through 12,483 stores (as of January29, 2016) in 43 states covering most of the southern, southwestern, midwestern and eastern United States. The Company has owned distribution centers ("DCs") in Scottsville, Kentucky; South Boston, Virginia; Alachua, Florida; Zanesville, Ohio; Jonesville, South Carolina; Marion, Indiana; Bessemer, Alabama; Bethel, Pennsylvania; and San Antonio, Texas, and leased DCs in Ardmore, Oklahoma; Fulton, Missouri; Indianola, Mississippi; and Lebec, California.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original maturities of three months or less when purchased. Such investments primarily consist of money market funds, bank deposits, certificates of deposit, and commercial paper. The carrying amounts of these items are a reasonable estimate of their fair value due to the short maturity of these investments.
Payments due from processors for electronic tender transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $59.5million and $58.5million at January29, 2016 and January30, 2015, respectively.
At January29, 2016, the Company maintained cash balances to meet a $20million minimum threshold set by insurance regulators, as further described below under "Insurance liabilities." Investments in debt and equity securities The Company accounts for investments in debt and marketable equity securities as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading, depending on their classification. Debt securities categorized as held-to-maturity are stated at amortized cost. Debt and equity securities categorized as available-for-sale are stated at fair value, with any unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Trading securities are stated at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded as a component of Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.
Merchandise inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the retail last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method as this method results in a better matching of costs and revenues. Under the Company's retail inventory method ("RIM"), the calculation of gross profit and the resulting valuation of inventories at cost are computed by applying a calculated cost-to-retail inventory ratio to the retail value of sales at a department level. The use of the RIM will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market ("LCM") if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories. Costs directly associated with warehousing and distribution are capitalized into inventory.
46 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 1. Basis of presentation and accounting policies (Continued) The excess of current cost over LIFO cost was approximately $92.9million and $95.1million at January29, 2016 and January30, 2015, respectively. Current cost is determined using the RIM on a first-in, first-out basis. Under the LIFO inventory method, the impacts of rising or falling market price changes increase or decrease cost of sales (the LIFO provision or benefit). The Company recorded a LIFO provision (benefit) of $(2.3) million in 2015, $4.2million in 2014, and $(11.0) million in 2013, which is included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income.
The Company purchases its merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers. The Company's largest and second largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 7% of the Company's purchases in 2015.
Vendor rebates The Company accounts for all cash consideration received from vendors in accordance with applicable accounting standards pertaining to such arrangements. Cash consideration received from a vendor is generally presumed to be a rebate or an allowance and is accounted for as a reduction of merchandise purchase costs as earned. However, certain specific, incremental and otherwise qualifying SG&A expenses related to the promotion or sale of vendor products may be offset by cash consideration received from vendors, in accordance with arrangements such as cooperative advertising, when earned for dollar amounts up to but not exceeding actual incremental costs.
Prepaid expenses and other current assets Prepaid expenses and other current assets include prepaid amounts for rent, maintenance, business licenses, advertising, and insurance, and amounts receivable for certain vendor rebates (primarily those expected to be collected in cash) and coupons.
Property and equipment In 2007, the Company's property and equipment was recorded at estimated fair values as the result of a merger transaction. Property and equipment acquired subsequent to the merger has been recorded at cost. The Company records depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the assets' 47 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 1. Basis of presentation and accounting policies (Continued) estimated useful lives. The Company's property and equipment balances and depreciable lives are summarized as follows: (In thousands) Depreciable Life January29, 2016 January30, 2015 Land Indefinite $ 188,532 $ 172,329 Land improvements 20 66,955 55,375 Buildings 39- 40 834,884 800,346 Leasehold improvements (a) 402,997 361,557 Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3- 10 2,526,843 2,295,590 Construction in progress 150,275 68,360           4,170,486 3,753,557 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization 1,906,424 1,637,482           Net property and equipment $ 2,264,062 $ 2,116,075                               (a) Amortized over the lesser of the life of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Depreciation expense related to property and equipment was approximately $350.6million, $335.9million and $315.3million for 2015, 2014 and 2013. Amortization of capital lease assets is included in depreciation expense. Interest on borrowed funds during the construction of property and equipment is capitalized where applicable. Interest costs of $1.4million, $0.2million and $1.2million were capitalized in 2015, 2014 and 2013.
Impairment of long-lived assets When indicators of impairment are present, the Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, in relation to the operating performance and future cash flows or the appraised values of the underlying assets. Generally, the Company's policy is to review for impairment stores open more than three years for which current cash flows from operations are negative. Impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. The Company's estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and difficult to predict. If a long-lived asset is found to be impaired, the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset's estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated based primarily upon estimated future cash flows over the asset's remaining useful life (discounted at the Company's credit adjusted risk-free rate) or other reasonable estimates of fair market value. Assets to be disposed of are adjusted to the fair value less the cost to sell if less than the book value.
The Company recorded impairment charges included in SG&A expense of approximately $5.9million in 2015, $1.9million in 2014 and $0.5million in 2013, to reduce the carrying value of certain of its stores' assets. Such action was deemed necessary based on the Company's evaluation that such amounts would not be recoverable primarily due to insufficient sales or excessive costs resulting in the carrying value of the assets exceeding the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by the assets at these locations.
48 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 1. Basis of presentation and accounting policies (Continued) Goodwill and other intangible assets The Company amortizes intangible assets over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present. Other intangible assets are tested for impairment if indicators of impairment are present. Impaired assets are written down to fair value as required. No impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented.
In accordance with accounting standards for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If after such assessment an entity concludes that the asset is not impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value of the asset using a quantitative impairment test, and if impaired, the associated assets must be written down to fair value as described in further detail below.
The quantitative goodwill impairment test is a two-step process that would require management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. The first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of an entity's reporting units based on valuation techniques (including a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts) and comparing that estimated fair value with the recorded carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an "implied fair value" of goodwill. The determination of the implied fair value of goodwill would require the entity to allocate the estimated fair value of its reporting unit to its assets and liabilities. Any unallocated fair value would represent the implied fair value of goodwill, which would be compared to its corresponding carrying value.
The quantitative impairment test for intangible assets compares the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
Other assets Noncurrent Other assets consist primarily of qualifying prepaid expenses for maintenance, beer and wine licenses, and utility, security and other deposits.
Accrued expenses and other liabilities Accrued expenses and other consist of the following: (In thousands) January29, 2016 January30, 2015 Compensation and benefits $ 111,191 $ 78,645 Insurance 82,182 81,944 Taxes (other than taxes on income) 136,762 124,893 Other 136,987 128,278         $ 467,122 $ 413,760                         Included in other accrued expenses are liabilities such as interest expense, freight expense, and utilities.
49 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 1. Basis of presentation and accounting policies (Continued) Insurance liabilities The Company retains a significant portion of risk for its workers' compensation, employee health, general liability, property and automobile claim exposures. Accordingly, provisions are made for the Company's estimates of such risks. The undiscounted future claim costs for the workers' compensation, general liability, and health claim risks are derived using actuarial methods and are recorded as self-insurance reserves pursuant to Company policy. To the extent that subsequent claim costs vary from those estimates, future results of operations will be affected as the reserves are adjusted.
Ashley River Insurance Company ("ARIC"), a South Carolina-based wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary of the Company, charges the operating subsidiary companies premiums to insure the retained workers' compensation and non-property general liability exposures. Pursuant to South Carolina insurance regulations, ARIC maintains certain levels of cash and cash equivalents related to its self-insured exposures. ARIC currently insures no unrelated third-party risk.
Operating leases and related liabilities Rent expense is recognized over the term of the lease. The Company records minimum rental expense on a straight-line basis over the base, non-cancelable lease term commencing on the date that the Company takes physical possession of the property from the landlord, which normally includes a period prior to the store opening to make necessary leasehold improvements and install store fixtures. When a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent, the Company recognizes the related rent expense on a straight-line basis and records the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent. Tenant allowances, to the extent received, are recorded as deferred incentive rent and are amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease. The difference between the calculated expense and the amounts paid result in a liability, with the current portion in Accrued expenses and other and the long-term portion in Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, and totaled approximately $57.9million and $54.6million at January29, 2016 and January30, 2015, respectively.
The Company recognizes contingent rental expense when the achievement of specified sales targets is considered probable. The amount expensed but not paid as of January29, 2016 and January30, 2015 was approximately $4.0million and $4.8million, respectively, and is included in Accrued expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheets.
Other liabilities Noncurrent Other liabilities consist of the following: (In thousands) January29, 2016 January30, 2015 Insurance $ 137,798 $ 140,916 Deferred rent 57,017 53,975 Deferred gain on sale leaseback 53,737 58,215 Other 26,731 32,203         $ 275,283 $ 285,309                         50 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 1. Basis of presentation and accounting policies (Continued) Fair value accounting The Company utilizes accounting standards for fair value, which include the definition of fair value, the framework for measuring fair value, and disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, fair value accounting standards establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level3 of the hierarchy).
Level1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Level2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are based on an entity's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, observable market activity. In instances where the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
The valuation of derivative financial instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis takes into account the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments (or receipts) and the discounted expected variable cash receipts (or payments). The variable cash receipts (or payments) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves.
The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. The Company considers the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees, to adjust the fair value of outstanding derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk. In connection with accounting standards for fair value measurement, the Company has made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of outstanding derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio.
Derivative financial instruments The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with applicable accounting standards for such instruments and hedging activities, which require that all derivatives are 51 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 1. Basis of presentation and accounting policies (Continued) recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge a certain portion of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply the hedge accounting standards.
Revenue and gain recognition The Company recognizes retail sales in its stores at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise. All sales are net of discounts and estimated returns and are presented net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed concurrent with those sales. The liability for retail merchandise returns is based on the Company's prior experience. The Company records gain contingencies when realized.
The Company recognizes gift card sales revenue at the time of redemption. The liability for the gift cards is established for the cash value at the time of purchase. The liability for outstanding gift cards was approximately $2.8million and $2.5million at January29, 2016 and January30, 2015, respectively, and is recorded in Accrued expenses and other liabilities. Estimated breakage revenue, a percentage of gift cards that will never be redeemed based on historical redemption rates, is recognized over time in proportion to actual gift card redemptions. The Company recorded breakage revenue of $0.6million and $2.4million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Advertising costs Advertising costs are expensed upon performance, "first showing" or distribution, and are reflected in SG&A expenses net of earned cooperative advertising amounts provided by vendors which are specific, incremental and otherwise qualifying expenses related to the promotion or sale of vendor products for dollar amounts up to but not exceeding actual incremental costs. Advertising costs were $89.3million, $77.3million and $70.5million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These costs primarily include promotional circulars, targeted circulars supporting new stores, television and radio advertising, in-store signage, and costs associated with the sponsorships of certain automobile racing activities. Vendor funding for cooperative advertising offset reported expenses by $36.7million, $35.0million and $31.9million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
52 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 1. Basis of presentation and accounting policies (Continued) Share-based payments The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based compensation based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of valuation and reduce expense ratably over the vesting period. This estimate may be adjusted periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the prior estimate. The forfeiture rate is the estimated percentage of share-based awards granted that are expected to be forfeited or canceled before becoming fully vested. The Company bases this estimate on historical experience or estimates of future trends, as applicable. An increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation expense.
The fair value of each option grant is separately estimated and amortized into compensation expense on a straight-line basis between the applicable grant date and each vesting date. The Company has estimated the fair value of all stock option awards as of the grant date by applying the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing valuation model. The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense.
The Company calculates compensation expense for restricted stock, share units and similar awards as the difference between the market price of the underlying stock or similar award on the grant date and the purchase price, if any. Such expense is recognized on a straight-line basis for graded awards or an accelerated basis for performance awards over the period in which the recipient earns the awards.
Store pre-opening costs Pre-opening costs related to new store openings and the related construction periods are expensed as incurred.
Income taxes Under the accounting standards for income taxes, the asset and liability method is used for computing the future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements or income tax returns. Deferred income tax expense or benefit is the net change during the year in the Company's deferred income tax assets and liabilities.
The Company includes income tax related interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income tax expense.
Income tax reserves are determined using a methodology which requires companies to assess each income tax position taken using a two-step process. A determination is first made as to whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained, based upon the technical merits, upon examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria, the benefit recorded for the tax position equals the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the respective tax position. Uncertain tax positions require determinations and estimated liabilities to be made based on provisions of the tax law which may be subject to change or varying interpretation. If the Company's determinations and estimates prove to be inaccurate, the resulting adjustments could be material to the Company's future financial results.
53 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 1. Basis of presentation and accounting policies (Continued) Management estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Accounting standards In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued comprehensive new accounting standards related to the recognition of revenue, which specified an effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2016, with early adoption not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date to annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2017, with earlier adoption permitted only for annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2016. The new guidance allows for companies to use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach in the adoption of this guidance. The Company is currently evaluating these transition approaches, as well as the potential timing of adoption and the effect of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
In April 2015, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to the presentation of debt issuance costs and requires such costs to be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts and/or premiums. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The guidance must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented within the financial statements. The Company adopted this guidance in the third quarter of 2015. As a result, the presentation of $15.5million of debt issuance costs (net of accumulated amortization) previously classified as Other assets, net are reflected in Long-term obligations on the consolidated balance sheet as of January30, 2015.
In November 2015, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which will require companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of separating them into current and noncurrent amounts. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. This guidance may be adopted on a prospective or retrospective basis. The Company adopted this guidance retrospectively in the fourth quarter of 2015. As a result, the presentation of $25.3million of deferred income taxes previously classified as a current liability are reflected in noncurrent deferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet as of January30, 2015.
In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to lease accounting. This guidance requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee will account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability on its balance sheet, with differing methodology for income statement recognition. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective approach is required for all leases existing or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the consolidated financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial 54 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 1. Basis of presentation and accounting policies (Continued) statements and is anticipating a material impact because the Company is party to a significant number of lease contracts.
Reclassifications Certain financial disclosures relating to prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation where applicable.

Expected future cash flows associated with the Company's intangible assets are not expected to be materially affected by the Company's intent or ability to renew or extend the arrangements. The Company's goodwill balance is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
For intangible assets subject to amortization, the estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the five succeeding fiscal years is as follows: 2016$0.3million, 2017$0.2million, 2018$0.2million and 2019$0.2million and 2020$0.1million.

Diluted earnings per share was determined based on the dilutive effect of share-based awards using the treasury stock method.
Options to purchase shares of common stock that were outstanding at the end of the respective periods, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect of exercising such options would be antidilutive, were 1.3million, 1.2million, and 1.2million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

This expense was greater than the federal statutory tax rate of 35% due primarily to the inclusion of state income taxes in the total effective tax rate. The 2015 effective income tax rate increased from 2014 due principally to federal and state reserve releases in 2014 that did not reoccur, to the same extent, in 2015.
The 2014 effective tax rate was an expense of 36.6%. This expense was greater than the federal statutory tax rate of 35% due primarily to the inclusion of state income taxes in the total effective tax rate. The 2014 effective income tax rate decreased from 2013 due principally to the favorable resolution of state income tax examinations and a reduction in other state income tax reserve increases.
The 2013 effective tax rate was an expense of 37.0%. This expense was greater than the federal statutory tax rate of 35% due primarily to the inclusion of state income taxes in the total effective tax rate.

See Note1 for additional information.
The Company has state tax credit carry forwards of approximately $16.5million that will expire beginning in 2021 through 2024.
A valuation allowance has been provided for state tax credit carry forwards. The 2015 decrease of $1.4million was recorded as a reduction in income tax expense. The 2014 increase of $1.5million and 2013 decrease of $0.4million were recorded as an increase and a reduction in income tax expense, respectively. Based upon expected future income, management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets after giving consideration to the valuation allowance.
The Company's 2010 and earlier tax years are not open for further examination by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). Due to the filing of an amended federal income tax return for the 2011 tax 58 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 4. Income taxes (Continued) year, the IRS may, to a limited extent, examine the Company's 2011 income tax filings. The IRS, at its discretion, may also choose to examine the Company's 2012 through 2014 fiscal year income tax filings. The Company has various state income tax examinations that are currently in progress. Generally, the Company's 2011 and later tax years remain open for examination by the various state taxing authorities.
As of January29, 2016, accruals for uncertain tax benefits, interest expense related to income taxes and potential income tax penalties were $7.0million, $0.9million and $0.8million, respectively, for a total of $8.7million. This total amount is reflected in noncurrent Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
As of January30, 2015, accruals for uncertain tax benefits, interest expense related to income taxes and potential income tax penalties were $9.3million, $1.0million and $0.4million, respectively, for a total of $10.7million. This total amount is reflected in noncurrent Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the reserve for uncertain tax positions may be reduced by approximately $2.6million in the coming twelve months principally as a result of the effective settlement of outstanding issues. Also, as of January29, 2016, approximately $7.0million of the uncertain tax positions would impact the Company's effective income tax rate if the Company were to recognize the tax benefit for these positions.
The amounts associated with uncertain tax positions included in income tax expense consists of the following: (In thousands) 2015 2014 2013 Income tax expense (benefit) $ (2,379 ) $ (9,497 ) $ (3,915 ) Income tax related interest expense (benefit) (23 ) (1,445 ) 590 Income tax related penalty expense (benefit) 373 51 30 A reconciliation of the uncertain income tax positions from February1, 2013 through January29, 2016 is as follows: (In thousands) 2015 2014 2013 Beginning balance $ 9,343 $ 19,583 $ 22,237 Increasestax positions taken in the current year 214 198 3,484 Increasestax positions taken in prior years 17 62 3,000 Decreasestax positions taken in prior years (106 ) (8,636 ) (608 ) Statute expirations (2,504 ) (1,121 ) (7,622 ) Settlements  (743 ) (908 )            Ending balance $ 6,964 $ 9,343 $ 19,583                                  59 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 5.

The amended and restated senior unsecured credit facilities (the "Facilities") consist of a $425.0million senior unsecured term loan facility (the "Term Facility") and a $1.0billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility") which provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to $175.0million. The Facilities are scheduled to mature on October20, 2020. The Company incurred $2.6million of new debt issuance costs associated with the refinancing of the Facilities.
Borrowings under the Facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable interest rate margin plus, at the Company's option, either (a)LIBOR or (b)a base rate (which is usually equal to the prime rate). The applicable interest rate margin for borrowings as of January29, 2016 was 1.10% for LIBOR borrowings and 0.10% for base-rate borrowings. The Company must also pay a facility fee, payable on any used and unused commitment amounts of the Facilities, and customary fees on letters of credit issued under the Revolving Facility. As of January29, 2016, the commitment fee rate was 0.15%. The applicable interest rate margins for borrowings, the facility fees and the letter of credit fees under the Facilities are subject to adjustment from time to time based on the Company's long-term senior unsecured debt ratings. The weighted average all-in interest rate for borrowings under the Facilities was 1.65% as of January29, 2016.
The Facilities can be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty. There is no required principal amortization under the Facilities. The Facilities contain a number of customary 60 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 5. Current and long-term obligations (Continued) affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the Company's and its subsidiaries' ability to: incur additional liens; sell all or substantially all of the Company's assets; consummate certain fundamental changes or change in the Company's lines of business; and incur additional subsidiary indebtedness. The Facilities also contain financial covenants which require the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. As of January29, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The Facilities also contain customary events of default.
As of January29, 2016, under the Revolving Facility, the Company had borrowing availability of $722.0million. In addition, the Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling $38.7million, $27.0million of which were issued under the Revolving Facility.
The Company incurred a pretax loss of $0.3million for the write off of debt issuance costs associated with the refinancing of its credit facilities, which is reflected in Other (income) expense in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended January29, 2016.
On October20, 2015, the Company issued $500.0million aggregate principal amount of 4.150% senior notes due 2025 (the "2025 Senior Notes"), net of discount of $0.8million, which are scheduled to mature on November1, 2025. Interest on the 2025 Senior Notes is payable in cash on May1 and November1 of each year, commencing on May1, 2016. The Company incurred $4.4million of debt issuance costs associated with the issuance of the 2025 Senior Notes. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2025 Senior Notes were used, together with borrowings under the Facilities, to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under the then-existing credit agreement and for general corporate purposes. Collectively, the 2025 Senior Notes and the Company's other Senior Notes due 2017, 2018 and 2023 as reflected in the table above comprise the "Senior Notes", each of which were issued pursuant to an indenture as supplemented and amended by supplemental indentures relating to each series of Senior Notes (as so supplemented and amended, the "Senior Indenture").
The Company may redeem some or all of its Senior Notes at any time at redemption prices set forth in the Senior Indenture. Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, which is defined in the Senior Indenture, each holder of the Senior Notes has the right to require the Company to repurchase some or all of such holder's Senior Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
The Senior Indenture contains covenants limiting, among other things, the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to (subject to certain exceptions): consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Company's assets; and to incur or guarantee indebtedness secured by liens on any shares of voting stock of significant subsidiaries.
The Senior Indenture also provides for events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on the Senior Notes to become or to be declared due and payable, as applicable.
Scheduled debt maturities, including capital lease obligations, for the Company's fiscal years listed below are as follows (in thousands): 2016$1,379; 2017$501,290; 2018$400,892; 2019$1,020; 2020$676,980; thereafter$1,409,835.

The Company does not have any recurring fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level3) as of January29, 2016.
7. Derivatives and hedging activities From time to time, the Company enters into certain financial instrument positions, all of which are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure.
Risk management objective of using derivatives The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and, from time to time, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company may enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined primarily by interest rates.
In addition, the Company is exposed to certain risks arising from uncertainties of future market values caused by the fluctuation in the prices of commodities. From time to time the Company may enter into derivative financial instruments to protect against future price changes related to these commodity prices.
62 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 7. Derivatives and hedging activities (Continued) Cash flow hedges of interest rate risk The Company's objectives when using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate changes. To accomplish these objectives, the Company has from time to time used interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The Company also previously entered into treasury locks that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk prior to the issuance of long-term debt in April 2013.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (also referred to as "OCI") and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps, if any, is recognized directly in earnings.
The Company had interest rate swaps with a combined notional value of $875.0million designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk that expired on May31, 2015. Such interest rate swaps were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt prior to their maturity. Amounts reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives were reclassified to interest expense as interest payments were made on the Company's variable-rate debt.
In April 2013, the Company recorded a loss on the settlement of treasury locks associated with the issuance of long-term debt which was deferred to OCI and is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the period of the debt's maturity in 2023. During the 52-week period following January29, 2016, the Company estimates that approximately $1.3million will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense related to the amortization of the loss associated with the treasury locks. All of the amounts reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets for the periods presented are related to cash flow hedges.
Non-designated hedges of commodity risk Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage the Company's exposure to commodity price risk but do not meet strict hedge accounting requirements. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded directly in earnings. As of January29, 2016, the Company had no such non-designated hedges.
The table below presents the fair value of the Company's derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the consolidated balance sheets as of January29, 2016 and January30, 2015: (in thousands) January29, 2016 January30, 2015 Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments Interest rate swaps classified as Accrued expenses and other current liabilities $  $ 1,173 63 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 7. Derivatives and hedging activities (Continued) The table below presents the pre-tax effect of the Company's derivative financial instruments as reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and shareholders' equity, as applicable: (in thousands) 2015 2014 2013 Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Loss related to effective portion of derivative recognized in OCI $ 3 $ 876 $ 16,036 Loss related to effective portion of derivative reclassified from Accumulated OCI to Interest expense $ 2,494 $ 5,130 $ 4,604 8. Commitments and contingencies Leases As of January29, 2016, the Company was committed under operating lease agreements for most of its retail stores. Many of the Company's stores are subject to build-to-suit arrangements with landlords which typically carry a primary lease term of up to 15years with multiple renewal options. The Company also has stores subject to shorter-term leases and many of these leases have renewal options. Certain of the Company's leased stores have provisions for contingent rentals based upon a specified percentage of defined sales volume.
The land and buildings of the Company's DCs in Fulton, Missouri and Indianola, Mississippi are subject to operating lease agreements and the leased Ardmore, Oklahoma DC is subject to a financing arrangement. The entities involved in the ownership structure underlying these leases meet the accounting definition of a Variable Interest Entity ("VIE"). The Company is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs and, accordingly, has not included these entities in its consolidated financial statements. Certain leases contain restrictive covenants, and as of January29, 2016, the Company is not aware of any material violations of such covenants.
In January 2014, the Company sold 233 store locations for cash and concurrent with the sale transaction, the Company leased the properties back for a period of 15years. The transaction resulted in cash proceeds of approximately $281.6million and a deferred gain of $67.2million which is being recognized as a reduction of rent expense over the 15-year initial lease term of the properties.
In January 1999, the Company sold its DC located in Ardmore, Oklahoma for cash and concurrent with the sale transaction, the Company leased the property back for a period of 23years. The transaction is being accounted for as a financing obligation rather than a sale as a result of, among other things, the lessor's ability to put the property back to the Company under certain circumstances. The property and equipment, along with the related lease obligation associated with this transaction are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. In August 2007, the Company purchased a secured promissory note (the "Ardmore Note") from an unrelated third party with a face value of $34.3million at the date of purchase which approximated the remaining financing obligation. The Ardmore Note represents debt issued by the third party entity from which the Company leases the Ardmore DC and therefore the Company holds the debt instrument pertaining to its lease financing obligation. Because a 64 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 8. Commitments and contingencies (Continued) legal right of offset exists, the Company is accounting for the Ardmore Note as a reduction of its outstanding financing obligation in its consolidated balance sheets.
Future minimum payments as of January29, 2016 for operating leases are as follows: (In thousands) 2016 $ 866,444 2017 831,367 2018 783,564 2019 720,569 2020 632,998 Thereafter 3,394,301      Total minimum payments $ 7,229,243                Total minimum payments for capital leases were $5.9million, with a present value of $4.8million, as of January29, 2016. The gross amount of property and equipment recorded under capital leases and financing obligations at both January29, 2016 and January31, 2015, was $29.8million. Accumulated depreciation on property and equipment under capital leases and financing obligations at January29, 2016 and January30, 2015, was $12.4million and $10.6million, respectively.
Rent expense under all operating leases is as follows: (In thousands) 2015 2014 2013 Minimum rentals(a) $ 849,115 $ 776,103 $ 674,849 Contingent rentals 7,793 9,099 12,058            $ 856,908 $ 785,202 $ 686,907                                  (a) Excludes amortization of leasehold interests of $0.9million, $5.8million and $11.9million included in rent expense for the years ended January29, 2016, January30, 2015, and January31, 2014, respectively.
Legal proceedings In September 2011, the Chicago Regional Office of the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC" or "Commission") notified the Company of a cause finding related to the Company's criminal background check policy. The cause finding alleges that the Company's criminal background check policy, which excludes from employment individuals with certain criminal convictions for specified periods, has a disparate impact on African-American candidates and employees in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended ("Title VII").
The Company and the EEOC engaged in the statutorily required conciliation process, and despite the Company's good faith efforts to resolve the matter, the Commission notified the Company on July26, 2012 of its view that conciliation had failed.
On June11, 2013, the EEOC filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entitled Equal Opportunity Commission v. Dolgencorp,LLC d/b/a Dollar General in 65 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 8. Commitments and contingencies (Continued) which the Commission alleges that the Company's criminal background check policy has a disparate impact on "Black Applicants" in violation of Title VII and seeks to recover monetary damages and injunctive relief on behalf of a class of "Black Applicants." The Company filed its answer to the complaint on August9, 2013.
The Court has bifurcated the issues of liability and damages for purposes of discovery and trial. Fact discovery related to liability is to be completed on or before November16, 2016. In response to various discovery motions, the court has entered orders requiring the Company's production of documents, information and electronic data for the period 2004 to present.
Currently pending is the EEOC's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment relating to two of the Company's defenses challenging the sufficiency of the Commission's conciliation efforts and the scope of its investigation. The Company has opposed this motion as prematurely-filed in light of the status of various discovery issues.
The Company believes that its criminal background check process is both lawful and necessary to a safe environment for its employees and customers and the protection of its assets and shareholders' investments. The Company also does not believe that this matter is amenable to class or similar treatment. However, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether the action will ultimately be permitted to proceed as a class or in a similar fashion or the size of any putative class. Likewise, at this time, it is not possible to estimate the value of the claims asserted, and no assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in its defense of this action on the merits or otherwise. For these reasons, the Company cannot estimate the potential exposure or range of potential loss. If the matter were to proceed successfully as a class or similar action or the Company is unsuccessful in its defense efforts as to the merits of the action, the resolution of this matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements as a whole.
On May23, 2013, a lawsuit entitled Juan Varela v. Dolgen California and Does 1 through 50 ("Varela") was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Riverside. In the original complaint, the Varela plaintiff alleges that he and other "key carriers" were not provided with meal and rest periods in violation of California law and seeks to recover alleged unpaid wages, injunctive relief, consequential damages, pre-judgment interest, statutory penalties and attorneys' fees and costs and seeks to represent a putative class of California "key carriers" as to these claims. The Varela plaintiff also asserts a claim for unfair business practices and seeks to proceed under California's Private Attorney General Act (the "PAGA"). The Company filed its answer to the complaint on July1, 2013.
On November4, 2014, the Varela plaintiff filed an amended complaint to add Victoria Lee Dinger Main as a named plaintiff and to add putative class claims on behalf of "key carriers" for alleged inaccurate wage statements and failure to provide appropriate pay upon termination in violation of California law. The Company filed its answer to the amended complaint on December23, 2014. The parties have been ordered to engage in informal discovery. A mediation was held in November 2015, which was unsuccessful.
On January15, 2015, a lawsuit entitled Kendra Pleasant v. Dollar General Corporation, Dolgen California,LLC, and Does 1 through 50 ("Pleasant") was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Bernardino in which the plaintiff seeks to proceed under the PAGA for various alleged violations of California's Labor Code. Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that she and 66 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 8. Commitments and contingencies (Continued) other similarly situated non-exempt California store-level employees were not paid for all time worked, provided meal and rest breaks, reimbursed for necessary work related expenses, and provided with accurate wage statements and seeks to recover unpaid wages, civil and statutory penalties, interest, attorneys' fees and costs. On March12, 2015, the Company filed a demurrer asking the court to stay all proceedings in the Pleasant matter pending an issuance of a final judgment in the Varela matter. The court granted the Company's demurrer and stayed proceedings until resolution of the Varela matter. Subsequently, the Pleasant plaintiff moved to transfer this matter to the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Riverside where the Varela matter is pending, which the Company opposed. The court denied the Pleasant plaintiff's motion to transfer.
On February20, 2015, a lawsuit entitled Julie Sullivan v. Dolgen California and Does 1 through 100 ("Sullivan") was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Alameda in which the plaintiff alleges that she and other similarly situated Dollar General Market store managers in the State of California were improperly classified as exempt employees and were not provided with meal and rest breaks and accurate wage statements in violation of California law. The Sullivan plaintiff also alleges that she and other California store employees were not provided with printed wage statements, purportedly in violation of California law. The plaintiff seeks to recover unpaid wages, including overtime pay, civil and statutory penalties, interest, injunctive relief, restitution, and attorneys' fees and costs.
On April8, 2015, the Company removed this matter to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and filed its answer on the same date. On April29, 2015, the Sullivan plaintiff amended her complaint to add a claim under the PAGA. The Company's response to the amended complaint was filed on May14, 2015. The plaintiff's motion for class certification was filed on March12, 2016. The matter has been set for trial on October31, 2016. A mediation conducted in early March 2016 was unsuccessful.
The Company believes that its policies and practices comply with California law and that the Varela, Pleasant , and Sullivan actions are not appropriate for class or similar treatment. The Company intends to vigorously defend these actions; however, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether the Varela, Pleasant , or Sullivan action ultimately will be permitted to proceed as a class, and no assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in its defense of these actions on the merits or otherwise. Similarly, at this time the Company cannot estimate either the size of any potential class or the value of the claims asserted in the Varela , Pleasant , or Sullivan action. For these reasons, the Company is unable to estimate any potential loss or range of loss in these matters; however, if the Company is not successful in its defense efforts, the resolution of any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements as a whole.
In December 2015, the Company was notified of seven lawsuits in which the plaintiffs allege violation of state consumer protection laws relating to the labeling, marketing and sale of Dollar General private-label motor oil. Six of these lawsuits were filed in various federal district courts of the United States: Bradford Barfoot and Leonard Karpeichik v. Dolgencorp,LLC (filed in the Southern District of Florida on December18, 2015) ("Barfoot"); Milton M. Cooke, Jr. v. Dollar General Corporation (filed in the Southern District of Texas on December21, 2015) ("Cooke"); William Flinn v. Dolgencorp,LLC (filed in the District Court for New Jersey on December17, 2015) ("Flinn"); John J. McCormick, III v. Dolgencorp,LLC (filed in the District Court of Maryland on December23, 2015) ("McCormick"); David Sanchez v. Dolgencorp,LLC (filed in the Central District of California on 67 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 8. Commitments and contingencies (Continued) December17, 2015) ("Sanchez"); and Will Sisemore v. Dolgencorp,LLC (filed in the Northern District of Oklahoma on December21, 2015) ("Sisemore").
The seventh matter, Chuck Hill v. Dolgencorp,LLC ("Hill"), was filed in Orleans County Superior Court in Vermont on December22, 2015, and subsequently removed to the United States District Court for the District of Vermont on February8, 2016.
In February and March 2016, the Company was notified of thirteen additional lawsuits alleging similar claims concerning Dollar General private-label motor oil. All of these lawsuits were filed in various federal district courts of the United States: Allen Brown v. Dollar General Corporation and DG Retail,LLC (filed in the District of Colorado on February10, 2016) ("Brown"); Miriam Fruhling v. Dollar General Corporation and Dolgencorp,LLC (filed in the Southern District of Ohio on February10, 2016) ("Fruhling"); John Foppe v. Dollar General Corporation and Dolgencorp,LLC (filed in the Eastern District of Kentucky on February10, 2016) ("Foppe"); Kevin Gadson v. Dolgencorp,LLC (filed in the Southern District of New York on February8, 2016) ("Gadson"); Bruce Gooel v. Dolgencorp,LLC (filed in the Eastern District of Michigan on February8, 2016) ("Gooel"); Janine Harvey v. Dollar General Corporation and Dolgencorp,LLC (filed in the District Court for Nebraska on February10, 2016) ("Harvey"); Nicholas Meyer v. Dollar General Corporation and DG Retail,LLC (filed in the District of Kansas on February9, 2016) ("Meyer"); Robert Oren v. Dollar General Corporation and Dolgencorp,LLC (filed in the Western District of Missouri on February8, 2016) ("Oren"); Scott Sheehy v. Dollar General Corporation and DG Retail,LLC (filed in the District Court for Minnesota on February9, 2016) ("Sheehy"); Gerardo Solis v. Dollar General Corporation and DG Retail,LLC (filed in the Northern District of Illinois on February12, 2016) ("Solis"); Roberto Vega v. Dolgencorp,LLC (filed in the Central District of California on February8, 2016) ("Vega"); Matthew Wait v. Dollar General Corporation and Dolgencorp,LLC (filed in the Western District of Arkansas on February16, 2016) ("Wait"); and James Taschner v. Dollar General Corporation and Dolgencorp, LLC (filed in the Eastern District of Missouri on March15, 2016) ("Taschner").
The plaintiffs in the Taschner, Vega and Sanchez matters seek to proceed on a nationwide and statewide class basis, while the plaintiffs in the other matters seek to proceed only on a statewide class basis. Each plaintiff seeks, for himself or herself and the putative class he or she seeks to represent, some or all of the following relief: compensatory damages, injunctive relief prohibiting the sale of the products at issue and requiring the dissemination of corrective advertising, certain statutory damages (including treble damages), punitive damages and attorneys' fees.
On February1, 2016, the Sanchez plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his complaint without prejudice.
The Company filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims and a motion to strike the class allegations in the Barfoot matter on February4, 2016; in the Hill matter on February8, 2016; in the Cooke matter on February24, 2016; in the Sisemore matter on March4, 2016; and in the Flinn matter on March10, 2016.
On March7, 2016, the Company filed a motion with the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation requesting that all cases be transferred to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, or, in the alternative to the Western District of Missouri or the Southern District of Florida, for consolidated pretrial proceedings ("Motion to Transfer"). After receiving notice of the Company's Motion to Transfer, the court stayed and administratively closed the Barfoot matter pending a transfer decision by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation.
68 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 8. Commitments and contingencies (Continued) The Company's responsive pleadings are due in the McCormick matter on March21, 2016; in the Fruhling matter on April4, 2016; in the Meyer matter on April6, 2016; in the Sheehy matter on April7, 2016; in the Solis matter on April8, 2016; in the Foppe matter and Gooel matter on April15, 2016; and in the Harvey , Oren and Vega matters on April22, 2016.
The Company believes that the labeling, marketing and sale of its private-label motor oil complies with applicable federal and state requirements and is not misleading. The Company further believes that these matters are not appropriate for class or similar treatment. The Company intends to vigorously defend these actions; however, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether any of these cases will be permitted to proceed as a class or the size of any putative class. Likewise, at this time, it is not possible to estimate the value of the claims asserted, and no assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in its defense of these actions on the merits or otherwise. For these reasons, the Company is unable to estimate the potential loss or range of loss in these matters; however if the Company is not successful in its defense efforts, the resolution of any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements as a whole.
From time to time, the Company is a party to various other legal actions involving claims incidental to the conduct of its business, including actions by employees, consumers, suppliers, government agencies, or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation, including without limitation under federal and state employment laws and wage and hour laws. The Company believes, based upon information currently available, that such other litigation and claims, both individually and in the aggregate, will be resolved without a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements as a whole. However, litigation involves an element of uncertainty. Future developments could cause these actions or claims to have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. In addition, certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to the Company or settled by the Company, may result in liability material to the Company's financial position or may negatively affect operating results if changes to the Company's business operation are required.
9. Benefit plans The Dollar General Corporation 401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan, which became effective on January1, 1998, is a safe harbor defined contribution plan and is subject to the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act ("ERISA").
A participant's right to claim a distribution of his or her account balance is dependent on the plan, ERISA guidelines and Internal Revenue Service regulations. All active participants are fully vested in all contributions to the 401(k) plan. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company expensed approximately $15.0million, $13.7million and $13.0million, respectively, for matching contributions.
The Company also has a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan ("SERP") and compensation deferral plan ("CDP"), known as the Dollar General Corporation CDP/SERP Plan, for a select group of management and other key employees. The Company incurred compensation expense for these plans of approximately $1.1million, $0.8million and $1.2million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
The CDP/SERP Plan assets are invested in accounts selected by the Company's Compensation Committee or its delegate, and the associated deferred compensation liability is reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as further discussed in Note6.
69 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 10. Share-based payments The Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with applicable accounting standards, under which the fair value of each award is separately estimated and amortized into compensation expense over the service period. The fair value of the Company's stock option grants are estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of valuation and reduce expense ratably over the vesting period. The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense.
On July6, 2007, the Company's Board of Directors adopted the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan for Key Employees, which plan was subsequently amended (as so amended, the "Plan"). The Plan allows the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other stock-based awards or dividend equivalent rights to key employees, directors, consultants or other persons having a service relationship with the Company, its subsidiaries and certain of its affiliates. The number of shares of Company common stock authorized for grant under the Plan is 31,142,858. As of January29, 2016, 18,556,241 of such shares are available for future grants.
Since May 2011, most of the share-based awards issued by the Company have been in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units. With limited exceptions, stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees generally vest ratably on an annual basis over four-year and three-year periods, respectively. Awards granted to board members generally vest ratably over a one or three-year period. Performance share units generally vest ratably over a three-year period, provided that certain minimum performance criteria are met in the year of grant. With limited exceptions, the performance share unit and restricted stock unit awards are payable in shares of common stock on the vesting date.
From July 2007 through May 2011, a significant majority of the Company's share-based awards were a combination of stock options that vest solely upon the continued employment of the recipient ("MSA Time Options") and options that vest upon the achievement of predetermined annual or cumulative financial-based targets ("MSA Performance Options") (collectively, the "MSA Options"). MSA Options generally vest ratably on an annual basis over a period of approximately five years, with limited exceptions. The MSA Options are subject to various provisions set forth in a management stockholder's agreement ("MSA") entered into with each option holder. The MSA Options have a contractual term of 10years and an exercise price equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.
The weighted average for key assumptions used in determining the fair value of all stock options granted in the years ended January29, 2016, January30, 2015, and January31, 2014, and a summary of the methodology applied to develop each assumption, are as follows: January29, 2016 January30, 2015 January31, 2014 Expected dividend yield 1.2 % 0 % 0 % Expected stock price volatility 25.3 % 25.6 % 26.2 % Weighted average risk-free interest rate 1.8 % 1.9 % 1.2 % Expected term of options (years) 6.4 6.3 6.3            70 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 10. Share-based payments (Continued) Expected dividend yieldThis is an estimate of the expected dividend yield on the Company's stock. An increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense.
Expected stock price volatilityThis is a measure of the amount by which the price of the Company's common stock has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate. Since November 2011, the expected volatilities for awards have been based on the historical volatility of the Company's publicly traded common stock. An increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense.
Weighted average risk-free interest rateThis is the U.S. Treasury rate for the week of the grant having a term approximating the expected life of the option. An increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation expense.
Expected term of optionsThis is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding. The Company has estimated the expected term as the mid-point between the vesting date and the contractual term of the option. An increase in the expected term will increase compensation expense.
A summary of the Company's stock option activity, exclusive of options subject to an MSA, during the year ended January29, 2016 is as follows: (Intrinsic value amounts reflected in thousands) Options Issued Average Exercise Price Remaining Contractual Term in Years Intrinsic Value Balance, January30, 2015 2,399,124 $ 49.69 Granted 1,247,557 74.73 Exercised (703,956 ) 45.66 Canceled (512,760 ) 61.67               Balance, January29, 2016 2,429,965 $ 61.19 8.1 $ 33,701                                           Exercisable at January29, 2016 517,375 $ 47.31 6.7 $ 14,355                                           The weighted average grant date fair value per share of non-MSA options granted was $18.48, $17.26 and $13.86 during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The intrinsic value of non-MSA options exercised during 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $20.8million, $2.5million and $0.8million, respectively.

At January29, 2016, 173,091 MSA Time Options were outstanding, all of which were exercisable, with an average exercise price of $20.36, an average remaining contractual term of 3.8years, and an aggregate intrinsic value of $9.5million. The intrinsic value of MSA Time Options exercised during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $6.6million, $6.8million and $39.4million, respectively.
At January29, 2016, 151,097 MSA Performance Options were outstanding, all of which were exercisable, with an average exercise price of $21.23, an average remaining contractual term of 3.9years, and an aggregate intrinsic value of $8.1million. The intrinsic value of MSA Performance Options exercised during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $4.9million, $4.9million and $39.1million, respectively.
In March 2012, the Company issued a performance-based award of 326,037 shares of restricted stock to its former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The restricted stock award had a fair value on the grant date of $45.25 per share, with the award scheduled to vest in one-half increments contingent upon, among other things, meeting certain specified earnings per share targets for 2014 and 2015. The target for 2014 was met and the applicable shares vested. Certain conditions relating to the 2015 tranche of the award were not satisfied and therefore the applicable shares did not vest.
At January29, 2016, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based awards was $48.2million with an expected weighted average expense recognition period of 1.7years.

As of January29, 2016, a cumulative total of $4.0billion had been authorized under the program since its inception and $923.8million remained available for repurchase. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date and allows repurchases from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and number of shares purchased depends on a variety of factors, such as price, market conditions, compliance with the covenants and restrictions 73 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 12. Common stock transactions (Continued) under the Company's debt agreements and other factors.

75 ITEM 9.CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable.
ITEM 9A.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a)Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.
(b)Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our management prepared and is responsible for the consolidated financial statements and all related financial information contained in this report. This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
To comply with the requirements of Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management designed and implemented a structured and comprehensive assessment process to evaluate the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Such assessment was based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013 Framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management regularly monitors our internal control over financial reporting, and actions are taken to correct any deficiencies as they are identified. Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of January29, 2016.
Ernst& YoungLLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements, has issued an attestation report on management's assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Such attestation report is contained below.
76 (c)Attestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Dollar General Corporation We have audited Dollar General Corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of January29, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Dollar General Corporation and subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Dollar General Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January29, 2016, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Dollar General Corporation and subsidiaries as of January29, 2016 and January30, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January29, 2016 of Dollar General Corporation and subsidiaries and our report dated March22, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
/s/ Ernst& YoungLLP Nashville, Tennessee March22, 2016 77 (d)Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
There have been no changes during the quarter ended January29, 2016 in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15(f)) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
ITEM 9B.OTHER INFORMATION On March7, 2016, Mr. John W. Flanigan, Executive Vice President, Global Supply Chain, advised the Company of his intent to retire effective April29, 2016.
On March16, 2016, the Company's Compensation Committee (the "Committee") awarded 119,599 non-qualified stock options ("Options") and 27,367 performance share units ("PSUs") to Mr.Vasos and 32,890 Options and 7,526 PSUs to each of Messrs.Garratt, Flanigan and Ravener and Ms.Taylor on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the form of Option award agreement and form of PSU award agreement attached hereto as Exhibit10.5 and Exhibit10.10, respectively (collectively, the "Form Award Agreements"), and subject to the terms and conditions of the previously filed Amended and Restated 2007 Stock Incentive Plan for Key Employees of Dollar General Corporation (the "Plan").
The Options have a term of ten years and, subject to earlier forfeiture or accelerated vesting under certain circumstances described in the form of Option award agreement, generally will vest in four equal annual installments beginning on April1, 2017.
The PSUs represent a target number of units that can be earned if certain performance measures are achieved during the performance period (which is the Company's fiscal year 2016) (the "Performance Period") and if certain additional vesting requirements are met. The performance measures are goals related to adjusted EBITDA (weighted 50%) and ROIC (weighted 50%) as established by the Committee on the grant date. The number of PSUs earned will vary between 0% and 300% of the target amount based on actual performance compared to target performance on a graduated scale, with performance at the target level resulting in 100% of the target number of PSUs being earned. At the conclusion of the Performance Period, the Committee will determine the level of achievement of each performance goal measure and the corresponding number of PSUs earned by each grantee. Subject to certain pro-rata vesting conditions, one-third of the PSUs earned by each grantee will vest on the last day of the Performance Period and be paid on April1, 2017. The remaining two-thirds of the PSUs earned by each grantee will vest in equal installments on April1, 2018 and April1, 2019, in each case subject to the grantee's continued employment with the Company and certain accelerated vesting provisions described in the form of PSU award agreement.
The Form Award Agreements also provide that in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Form Award Agreements) of the Company, a grantee will only receive an accelerated payout of his or her equity award if a Qualifying Termination (as defined in the Form Award Agreements) occurs within two years following the Change in Control.
Also, on March16, 2016, in addition to the award of Options and PSUs as outlined above, the Committee awarded Mr.Vasos 85,759 Options according to the terms of the form of Option award agreement attached hereto as Exhibit10.38 and subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. Subject to certain forfeiture and limited vesting acceleration events (including the same Change in Control provisions as described above), such Option award is scheduled to vest ratably in installments of 33 1/3% on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date, subject to holding requirements through the fifth anniversary of the grant date, and will terminate no later than ten years from the grant date.
The foregoing descriptions of all Options and PSU awards and the forms of award agreements are summaries only, do not purport to be complete, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the filed forms of award agreement attached hereto as Exhibits10.5, 10.10 and 10.38.
